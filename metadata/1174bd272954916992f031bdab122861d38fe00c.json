The film is based on a novel by Lionel White and stars Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Vince Edwards, Jay C. Flippen and Ted de Corsia. The Killing is: very good, a satisfying piece of cinema that impresses both in its direction and writing - well worth the price of the cinema ticket or DVD or a donation to Demonoid.\n \nFirst-rate, exciting, fatalistic caper film,was Stanley Kubrick's first major work - it is his one picture that almost everyone likes.\nStrongly recommended for any film noir fan -- it's full of double-crosses and surprises, loaded with honest crooks, weak men, one wicked woman and some great two-fisted dialogue.\n \nCharacteristically Kubrick in both its mechanistic coldness and its vision of human endeavour undone by greed and deceit, this noir-ish heist movie is nevertheless far more satisfying than most of his later work, due both to a lack of bombastic pretensions and to the style fitting the subject matter. \n\nHayden is his usual admirable self as the ex-con who gathers together a gallery of small-timers to rob a race-track; for once it's not the robbery itself that goes wrong, but the aftermath. What is remarkable about the movie, besides the excellent performances of an archetypal noir cast and Lucien Ballard's steely photography, is the time structure, employing a complex series of flashbacks both to introduce and explain characters and to create a synchronous view of simultaneous events. \n \nVIDEO\nSize.... 649mb\nDuration.... 01:20:31\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 432\nData Rate.... 1052kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 71kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1174bd272954916992f031bdab122861d38fe00c","amp;dn":"The+Killing+1956+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1174bd272954916992f031bdab122861d38fe00c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,116,189,39,41,84,145,105,146,240,49,189,171,18,40,97,211,143,224,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
