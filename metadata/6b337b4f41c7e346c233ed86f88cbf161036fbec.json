UFOs, crop circles, Roswell, alien abductionsÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all answered! The well researched data leads the reader inexorably to one conclusion: there is an Ã¢â‚¬ËœintergalacticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ battle over the history of life in the universe, and for the souls of human beings. Its eye-opening insights have already won souls for Christ. This new edition contains more pictures and a new chapter about alleged abductions based on extra research Gary has conducted. \n\n\nAbout the author:\nAs a lifelong fan of sci-fi, Gary BatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ extensive background in marketing and communication have positioned him well to present in a fast-paced, gripping read the findings of his specialist research into UFO phenomenon and associated extraterrestrial beliefs.\nUnlike many UFO researchers, he avoids the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœone-size-fits-allÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ explanation. But his research, along with uncovering many bizarre claims (and debunking some), leads the reader on a fascinating exploration of myth, mystery, and questions of who we are, how we came to be Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and are we alone in this great big universe. A convert to Christianity, Gary recognizes the way in which UFO beliefs are rapidly escalating in society and the church, challenging the foundations of many faiths. For many years, Gary has been speaking to church audiences on science topics, including creation/evolution. He is currently the head of the ministry development department of what is possibly AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest parachurch organization, one that has spawned sister offices in five other countries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b337b4f41c7e346c233ed86f88cbf161036fbec","amp;dn":"Alien+Intrusion+-+Gary+Bates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b337b4f41c7e346c233ed86f88cbf161036fbec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,51,123,79,65,199,227,70,194,51,237,134,248,140,191,22,16,54,251,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
