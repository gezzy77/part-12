High street brands such as Zara, Topshop and H&amp;M have put fashion within the reach of anyone, whilst massive media attention has turned designers such as Tom Ford, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney into brands in their own right. This updated new edition of the international best-seller Fashion Brands explores the popularization of fashion and explains how marketers and branding experts have turned clothes and accessories into objects of desire. Full of first hand interviews with key players, it analyses every aspect of fashion from a marketing perspective. With its finger firmly on the fashion pulse, it also looks at the impact of blogging and the rise of celebrity-endorsed products and fashion ranges. Snappy and journalistic, Fashion Brands exposes how the use of advertising, store design and the media has altered our fashion 'sense' - and reveals how a mere piece of clothing can be transformed into something with mystical allure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1e40ca3a0401eafc9b80a3c16464c472fe6f14","amp;dn":"Fashion+Brands%2C+3E-+Mark+Tungate+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1e40ca3a0401eafc9b80a3c16464c472fe6f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,30,64,202,58,4,1,234,252,155,128,163,193,100,100,196,114,254,111,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
