To achieve these goals he devised an Academic Bill of Rights and created a national student movement with chapters on 160 college campuses. Take No Prisoners is a riveting account of the reaction to Horowitz's campaign by professor unions and academic associations, whose leaderships have been taken over by the political left.\nIn dramatic commentary, Indoctrination U. unveils the intellectual corruption of American universities by faculty activists who have turned America's classrooms into indoctrination centers for their political causes. It describes how academic radicals with little regard for professional standards or the pluralistic foundations of American society have created an ideological curriculum that it is as odds with the traditional purposes of a democratic education.\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Horowitz is an ex-Marxist and now conservative author and lecturer on college campuses. He was employed during the 1960s as a political aide to Bertrand Russell, a editor of Ramparts and one of the founders of the non-profit organization: David Horowitz Freedom Center. He now serves as the editor of FrontPage Magazine, a popular conservative online political magazine. David Horowitz's writings also often appear in Jewish World Review and Newsmax. His criticism of Huey P. Newton's Black Panther Party is well known, as is his further criticism and self-criticism of the Radical Left in Destructive Generation (1989)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0d919eb1ab502f75c592b6a6d0a1dc11335ce3","amp;dn":"Indoctrination+U+-+David+Horowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0d919eb1ab502f75c592b6a6d0a1dc11335ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,13,145,158,177,171,80,47,117,197,146,182,166,208,161,220,17,51,92,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
