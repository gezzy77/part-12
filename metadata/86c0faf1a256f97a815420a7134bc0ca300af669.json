With pencil marks and music, Alexi carves out a comfortable space for herself as she and the Captain finish each other's songsÃ¢â‚¬â€words on a desk feel safer than words spoken aloud.\n\nBut when Bodee Lennox, the quiet and awkward boy next door, comes to live with the Littrells, Alexi discovers an unlikely friend who understands her better than anyone.

As they lean on each other for support, Alexi gives him the strength to deal with his past, and Bodee helps her find the courage to finally speak up.\n\nWith her powerful, moving debut novel, author Courtney C. Stevens emerges as an extraordinary new talent to watch.
