Developed and presented with audio meditation specialist Karen Newell, co-founder of Sacred Acoustics, these four sounds journeys combine digital harmonic frequencies, sacred instruments, sounds from nature and the human voice to help listeners recreate the four stages of Dr. AlexanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s miraculous spiritual experience: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything is a Vibration,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thinning the Veil,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shift Your Perspective,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Connecting with Source.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThese journeys to the spiritual core of existence are designed to help you separate yourself from day-to-day concerns and find out about your true self, appreciate the nature of our interconnectedness, and access a transcendent understanding of hope, comfort, forgiveness and love. With Seeking Heaven, Dr. Alexander helps you get in touch with the profound wisdom imparted in the spiritual realms he visited and experience it in your own life.\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nRunning Time: 2 Hr 40 min\n\nSecure rip\n\nISBN-13: 978-1442367555","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f0c77bb2e24d76a357ffba84816f63e432f0a8","amp;dn":"Eben+Alexander+Karen+Newell+Seeking+Heaven+Sound+Journeys+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f0c77bb2e24d76a357ffba84816f63e432f0a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,240,199,123,178,226,77,118,163,87,255,186,132,129,111,99,228,50,240,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
