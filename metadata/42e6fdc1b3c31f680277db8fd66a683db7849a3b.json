We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e6fdc1b3c31f680277db8fd66a683db7849a3b","amp;dn":"Dont+Be+A+Menace+To+South+Central+While+Drinking+Your+Juice+In+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e6fdc1b3c31f680277db8fd66a683db7849a3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,230,253,193,179,195,31,104,2,119,219,143,214,106,104,61,183,132,154,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
