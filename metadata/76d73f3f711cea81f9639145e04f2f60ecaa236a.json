His live shows are pure joy, with the\nIsraeli-born bassist bobbing, weaving, whooping and playing a rhythmic\nblur. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s locked into his music with an intensity and purpose that is rare and\nbeautiful. On Live At Smalls, we catch Avital and his quintet at one of New\nYork CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best clubs at presenting the next generation of jazz. Before\ntalking about the music, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to address the bandÃ¢â‚¬â€Avishai Cohen on\ntrumpet, Jason Lindner on piano, Joel Frahm on tenor sax and Jonathan Blake on\ndrums. Each of these artists is fantastic in his own right. Together, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re\non fire. Now, for the music. All eight tracks are Avital originals. They are\nstunning for their drive, beautiful horn lines and fine improvisation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the\nwhole package. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Theme For A Brighter FutureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ leads off the recording with a\nsoulful groove. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Magic CarpetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scorches the earth with stinging solos and\ninterplay between Avital, Frahm and Cohen. AvitalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass intro into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anthem For\nLifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows his deep understanding of soul musicÃ¢â‚¬â€be it Middle Eastern,\nclassical, or the blues-driven American variety. And the closing number,\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“(Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Just Some) Small Time Shit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ leads you back around to a great groove and a\nlaugh with the band singing the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title. This is hard-driving jazz with a\nnew soul for a new era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d73f3f711cea81f9639145e04f2f60ecaa236a","amp;dn":"Omer+Avital+Quintet+-+Live+At+Smalls+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d73f3f711cea81f9639145e04f2f60ecaa236a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,215,63,63,113,28,234,129,249,99,145,69,224,79,47,96,236,170,35,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
