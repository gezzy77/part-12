This is the album that solidified his perception as a &quot;protest singer&quot; (a label he quickly rejected). It's darker and lacks the levity and diversity found on his previous releases, but it's still a fine record. Of course the title track was a big hit, serving (whether Bob wanted it to or not) as one of folk music's anthems for the Civil Rights movement and for the hope that the world wasn't coming to an end.\n\nCover art, logfile and FLAC fingerprints included.\n\nRipping notes: These FLAC files were made from the 2005 Remaster, encoded to FLAC with the current version of XLD (CD Paranoia Mode).
