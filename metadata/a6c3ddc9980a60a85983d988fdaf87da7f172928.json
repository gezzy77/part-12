And it uses a chainsaw as a musical instrument. \nEffectively, I might add.\n\nThere is a strong AC/DC-tinged blues influence here. \nThe Jackyl sound is also heavily influenced by its southern location, especially evident in Jesse James Dupree's powerful and accent-laden voice. \nThis is mixed with a heavy guitar tone to create a truly unique, instantly recognizable sound.\n\nThough each and every track on this record is well-done, catchy and worthy of being a single, by far the most noticeable song is &quot;The Lumberjack.&quot; \nIts basic construction is nothing new: an elementary, clichÃƒÂ©d blues progression played at a relaxed swing tempo. \nWhat puts it over the top is the chainsaw solo.\n\nYes, a chainsaw solo. A bluesy chainsaw solo, cohesive, catchy and played in time. \nIt is recreated outstandingly at concerts.\n\nThis became a defining trait of a Jackyl record: each album since has featured a &quot;chainsaw song.&quot; \nPerhaps the only one to top &quot;The Lumberjack,&quot; though, was &quot;Headed for Destruction,&quot; from their sophomore release Push Comes to Shove. (In this track, they used a talk box to make it sound like the chainsaw was reciting the lines \nof the chorus.) \nAlso, the song itself was a bit more original, with riffs instead of the clichÃƒÂ© blues pattern. \nBut I digress. &quot;The Lumberjack&quot; was unprecedented, and it forced people to listen.\n\nThe rest of the record is filled with southern rock `n' roll attitude, minus the confederate flags of Lynyrd Skynyrd or Pantera. \nThere are songs about booze (&quot;Brain Drain&quot;), sex (&quot;Dirty Little Mind&quot;) and all-around being a &quot;Redneck Punk.&quot; \n\nThis version is nearly perfect: it is concise, catchy, loud and fun. \nUnderrated as it is nowadays, it is a worthwhile addition to the CD collection of any hard rock fan. \nIt's highly unlikely (though they did come close with Relentless), but hopefully Jackyl will one day make another record as good as its debut.\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; Flac &gt; dbPoweramp &gt; MP3\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U\nCovers: Front \nTags: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\n\nTrack Listings\n\n01.
