Braun (Wiley-VCH, 1998).pdf\r\n\r\nExplore the full productivity of your NMR equipment!\r\n\r\n- How one has to perform NMR experiments?\r\n- Which experiment conveys the desired information?\r\n- How do the applied pulse sequences work?\r\n- How can the desired informations be read off the spectra?\r\n- Which equipment is needed for special experiments?\r\n\r\nThe new edition of this highly successful book is expanded by another 50 important NMR experiments dedicated to the latest developments. The expansions mainly concern the fields of chemical applications, of very recent gradient selected experiments now arranged in two chapters (1D and 2D), \r\nand of the basics of solid-state NMR in a completely new chapter.\r\n\r\nAgain, all experiments from basic pulse determinations to advanced 2D and some 3D techniques have been performed especially for this book. The figures are taken directly from the spectrometer output and the reader can therefore rely\r\non the results presented.\r\nWritten by leading experts, it is a thorough guide through the maze of modern NMR tools. Being a textbook as well as a reference and work book for the laboratory, this book is a must for every scientist applying NMR as well as for students preparing for their lab courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32cc2935c5a3785c816fb4f004f6fb8021e753b6","amp;dn":"150+and+More+Basic+NMR++Experiments+-+S.+Braun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32cc2935c5a3785c816fb4f004f6fb8021e753b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,204,41,53,197,163,120,92,129,111,180,240,4,246,251,128,33,231,83,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
