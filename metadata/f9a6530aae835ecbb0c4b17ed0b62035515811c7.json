I tried to make it as easy as possible to setup :)\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n==================\n\nVST (32 and 64 bit Windows VST, and OSX VST)\nVST Presets\nInstructions (My own at README.txt, Team AiR's at air.nfo, and installation instructions in WIN and OSX)\nKeygen (by Team AiR)\n\n\nInstallation:\n==============\n\nThis is covered in README.txt, but I'll repeat it here:\n\nRun the keygen (don't enter in your real name &amp; email address, for paranoia sake), then follow the installation instructions provided in WIN or OSX. I simply copied over the contents of the WIN folder to my VST folder.\n\nWhen you load it for the first time, it will ask you to locate &quot;ValhallaShimmerKeyFile.xml&quot;. This is generated by the keygen, and is located where the keygen was run (usually in the same directory).\n\n\nProduct Info:\n==============\n\nValhallaShimmer is an algorithmic reverb designed for BIG sounds, from concert halls to the Taj Mahal to the Halls of Valhalla. All of the sliders have been designed to be tweaked in real time and have a smoothed response to avoid clicks when changing settings or automating the controls. At the same time, the algorithm has been highly optimized, so you get a huge reverb sound without straining your CPU.\n\nBy setting the Shift amount to +12 semitones, and the Feedback to 0.5 or greater, the classic Eno/Lanois Ã¢â‚¬Å“shimmerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sound is produced.  A wide variety of other sounds can be created by the algorithm, ranging from spring-esque reverbs to Ã¢â‚¬Å“reverseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reverbs, to glistening pitch shifted pads that are usually associated with high end hardware processors.\n\nFeatures:\n\nAt its core, ValhallaShimmer is a high quality reverberator, designed to produce a smooth decay, that is both dense and colorless. There are several reverberation modes available, to allow the user to dial in reverb decays of different sizes, ranging from smaller rooms to vast ambiences:\n\n * By adjusting the Feedback, Diffusion and Size controls, the attack, sustain and decay of the reverb signal can be fine tuned.\n * The modulation controls can be set to produce subtle mode thickening, glistening string ensemble-esque decays, and the distinctive random modulation of the older Lexicon hall algorithms.\n * Two tone controls and the Color Mode selector allow the timbre to be adjusted from bright and glistening to a more natural dark decay, similar to that produced by air absorption in large spaces.\n\nIn addition, ValhallaShimmer has the ability to pitch shift the feedback signal. There are 5 pitch shift modes available:\n\n * Single, where the feedback is shifted up or down by the Shift value.\n * Dual, where the feedback is shifted both up and down (in parallel) by the Shift value.\n * SingleReverse, where each grain is reversed before it is pitch shifted. This results in a smoother pitch shifting sound than the Single mode.\n * DualReverse. Similar to the Dual mode, but with reversed grains, for a smoother pitch shifting sound.\n * Bypass, which turns off the pitch shifting (useful for Ã¢â‚¬Å“standardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reverb sounds).\n\nCome with uncle and hear all proper!
