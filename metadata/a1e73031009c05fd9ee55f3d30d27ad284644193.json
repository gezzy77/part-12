The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the movie is loud and not too loud when the movie is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\n\nNote for the Rifftrax audio track - audio1, 2.0 Riff - the Rifftrax intro comments run 1m46s longer than the video running time. The picture is just black during this final audio part.\n\nBig thanks to the posters of the 1080p/5.1 encodes of the movie and the subs.\n\nSpecial Birdemic Notes:\n\n- The Birdemic Blu-Ray is just a direct transfer of the DVD so while this 720p encode was sourced from a native 1080p video, the quality is the same as the DVD.\n\n- The Birdemic 6 channel DTS soundtrack only has data on the left and right channels. The center, sub and rear channels are all blank so there is only a 2.0 Movie only track with this release.\n\n- There doesn't seem to be official subs for Birdemic. So homemade non-English subs were run through a popular, online translation web site for the English subs. This has created many very, very funny subtitles between the homemade translation and computer conversion to English.\nsub1: English (translated from French)\nsub2: English (translated from Portuguese)\nsub3: English (translated from Spanish)\nsub4: French\nsub5: Portuguese\nsub6: Spanish\n\nIf this Rifftrax was enjoyable, you haven't paid for it and you have a few dollars to spare, please consider purchasing this riff (3.99USD) or make a general donation (5USD and up) - they take Bitcoin now too  \n\nPlease check out other Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1e73031009c05fd9ee55f3d30d27ad284644193","amp;dn":"Birdemic+Shock+And+Terror+%282008%29+720p+Rifftrax+2ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1e73031009c05fd9ee55f3d30d27ad284644193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,231,48,49,0,156,5,253,158,229,95,61,48,210,122,210,132,100,65,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
