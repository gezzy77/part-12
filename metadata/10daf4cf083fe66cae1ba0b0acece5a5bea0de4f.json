In this gloomy, bedsit-riddled South London wreck, lorded over by a lecherous landlord, a horrifying collection quietly waits to be discovered. Yet all six residents have something to hide.\n\nCollette is on the run from her ex-boss; Cher is an underage children's home escapee; lonely Thomas tries to make friends with his neighbours; while a gorgeous Iranian asylum seeker and a 'quiet man' nobody sees try to keep themselves hidden. And there for them all is Vesta, a woman who knows everything that goes on in the house - or thought she did.\n\nThen in the dead of night, a terrible accident pushes the six into an uneasy alliance. But one of them is a killer, expertly hiding their pastime, all the while closing in on their next victim...\n\nAs a cloying heatwave suffocates the city, events build to an electrifying climax in this brilliantly constructed, tightly paced thriller.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10daf4cf083fe66cae1ba0b0acece5a5bea0de4f","amp;dn":"The+Killer+Next+Door+-+Alex+Marwood.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10daf4cf083fe66cae1ba0b0acece5a5bea0de4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,218,244,207,8,63,230,108,174,27,160,176,172,236,229,165,190,160,222,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
