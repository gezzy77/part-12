In this groundbreaking new book, Danny Dorling argues that housing is the defining issue of our times. Tracing how we got to our current crisis and how housing has come to reflect class and wealth in Britain, All That Is Solid radically shows that the solution to our problems - rising homelessness, a generation priced out of home ownership - is not, as is widely assumed, building more homes. Inequality, he argues, is what we really need to overcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53fbd753c12edb8a37b23526fbb30203ca656f7","amp;dn":"All+That+is+Solid%3A+The+Great+Housing+Disaster+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53fbd753c12edb8a37b23526fbb30203ca656f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,63,189,117,60,18,237,184,163,123,35,82,111,187,48,32,60,166,86,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
