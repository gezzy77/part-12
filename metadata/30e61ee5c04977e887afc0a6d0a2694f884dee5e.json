It was recorded at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow, Scotland, in early 1967. The album was released in August 1967 in the US (as The Live Kinks), and January 1968 in the UK. Live at Kelvin Hall received mixed reviews upon release, and sold poorly.\n\nThe album was first re-released on CD in 1987. In 1998, the album was reissued with both the mono and stereo mixes present. Unlike many albums in the Kinks catalogue which have received Deluxe Edition formats, Live At Kelvin Hall was passed on by Andrew Sandoval, who, at one point, attempted to remix the album. The mono mix was absent from the 2011 box set The Kinks In Mono, but the stereo mix was present in the 2005 box set The Pye Album Collection.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n2005 Stereo Mix\n\n    &quot;Till the End of the Day&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;* Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n    &quot;You're Lookin' Fine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n    &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n    &quot;Dandy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:06\n    &quot;I'm On An Island&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53\n    &quot;Come On Now&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n    &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:13\n    &quot;Medley&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:53\n       -&quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot; (J.
