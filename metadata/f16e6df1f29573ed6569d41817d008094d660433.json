While \nbiomedicine might alleviate a patient's physical distress, siddha doctors offer their clientele much more: \naffiliation to a timeless and pure community, the fantasy of a Tamil utopia, and even the prospect of \nimmortality. They speak of a golden age of Tamil civilization and of traditional medicine, drawing on \nbroader revivalist formulations of a pure and ancient Tamil community.\nWeiss analyzes the success of siddha doctors, focusing on how they have successfully garnered authority \nand credibility. While shedding light on their lives, vocations, and aspirations, Weiss also documents the \nchallenges that siddha doctors face in the modern world, both from a biomedical system that claims \nuniversal efficacy, and also from the rival traditional medicine, ayurveda, which is promoted as the national \nmedicine of an autonomous Indian state. Drawing on ethnographic data; premodern Tamil texts on \nmedicine, alchemy, and yoga; government archival resources; college textbooks; and popular literature \non siddha medicine and on the siddhar yogis, he presents an in-depth study of this traditional system of \nknowledge, which serves the medical needs of millions of Indians.\nWeiss concludes with a look at traditional medicine at large, and demonstrates that siddha doctors, despite \nresent trends toward globalization and biomedicine, reflect the wider political and religious dimensions of \nmedical discourse in our modern world. Recipes for Immortality proves that medical authority is based not \nonly on physical effectiveness, but also on imaginative processes that relate to personal and social \nidentities, conceptions of history, secrecy, loss, and utopian promise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16e6df1f29573ed6569d41817d008094d660433","amp;dn":"Recipes+for+Immortality-Healing+Religion+and+Community+in+South+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16e6df1f29573ed6569d41817d008094d660433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,110,109,241,242,149,115,237,101,105,212,24,23,208,8,9,77,102,4,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
