If thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the case, then Halie Loren, though young in years, must have already experienced many lives. From the first notes of the title song on her new jazz album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“They Oughta Write a SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, LorenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice leads the listener with lush, jazzy warmth to places both intimately alluring yet playfully enticing as she moves effortlessly in, out, and around the melodies with flawless, exquisite ease.\nThe CD includes many of the standards that have held steadfast across the years, along with HalieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s originals that fit nicely into a mold that could easily join the list of ageless songs. As an extra bonus, Loren, in collaboration with fellow musician Matt Treder (pianist), added three very different non-jazz selections that have been tastefully Ã¢â‚¬Å“jazzifiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into creative arrangements that fit seamlessly into the project and fill out the breadth of the album.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“They Oughta Write a SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes musical gems both old and new and meshes a stunning voice with stellar musicians to create a timeless classic that spans generations and genres. With this album, the golden era of music is reborn and re-crafted for a new millennium of music fans young and old.\nAlong with marvelously talented Matt Treder on piano/keys, Loren is joined by equally marvelous musicians Mark Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Schneider on bass, Brian West on percussion, and Tim McLaughlin on trumpet.
