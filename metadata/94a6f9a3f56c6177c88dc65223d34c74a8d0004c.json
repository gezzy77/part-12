The game features both Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, each with their own tools of environment manipulation. Additional features include, forgotten Disney characters and attractions, all-new levels, professional voice acting, Disney-inspired music and lyrics, and drop-in, drop-out two-player co-op support.\n\n\nReturn to Wasteland to face a challenge from an unexpected enemy.\nView larger\n\nJoin forces with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.\nView larger\nUnleash the Power of the Brush in a Whole New Way\n\nJoin Mickey and Oswald in an epic battle to save the magical world of Wasteland and change it forever.
