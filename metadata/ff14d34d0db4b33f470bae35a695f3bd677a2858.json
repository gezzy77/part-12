As Niels Bohr said, if you aren't shocked by quantum theory, you don't really understand it. For most people, quantum theory is synonymous with mysterious, impenetrable science. And in fact for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves.\n\nIn this tour de force of science history, Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly written account of this fundamental scientific revolution, focusing on the central conflict between Einstein and Bohr over the nature of reality and the soul of science. This revelatory book takes a close look at the golden age of physics, the brilliant young minds at its core, and how an idea ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the 20th century.\n\nManjit Kumar was the founding editor of Prometheus, an arts-and-sciences journal. He has written and reviewed for various publications, including the Guardian, and is a consulting science editor at Wired UK. He lives in London.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff14d34d0db4b33f470bae35a695f3bd677a2858","amp;dn":"Manjit+Kumar+-+Quantum%3B+Einstein%2C+Bohr%2C+and+the+Great+Debate+abo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff14d34d0db4b33f470bae35a695f3bd677a2858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,20,211,77,13,180,179,63,71,11,174,53,166,149,243,189,103,122,40,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
