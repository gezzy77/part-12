During his 10 years in band, from 1965 to 1975, he sang, wrote or co-wrote many hit songs including &quot;American Woman,&quot; &quot;No Time,&quot; &quot;Share the Land,&quot; &quot;Hand Me Down World,&quot; &quot;Undun,&quot; &quot;Laughing,&quot; &quot;Star Baby&quot;, &quot;New Mother Nature,&quot; and &quot;These Eyes.&quot; His solo career includes many Canadian hit singles including &quot;Stand Tall&quot;, &quot;My Own Way to Rock&quot;, &quot;Fine State of Affairs&quot; and &quot;You Saved My Soul.&quot; He is also regarded for labelling the term &quot;Negativipeg&quot; on Winnipeg after he was assaulted at a 7-Eleven in the city.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCummings was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as were all of the other original members of The Guess Who. Burton was raised by his mother Rhoda and her parents; he never knew his father, who left when he was less than a year old.[5] Burton attended St. John's High School. His first band was a local Winnipeg R&amp;B group, The Deverons, with an 'E' (not to be confused with the band The Deverons who had Country/R&amp;B hits in the early 1960s). The Deverons with Cummings released two singles on the tiny REO Records label. The first single, &quot;Blue Is The Night / She's Your Lover&quot;, was cut in a Winnipeg radio station. The second single, &quot;Lost Love / Feel Alright&quot;, was recorded at Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis, where The Guess Who frequently recorded. He joined the band in 1966 replacing original keyboardist Bob Ashley and later replacing original lead singer, Chad Allan.\n\nSuccess with The Guess Who:\n\nBetween 1966 and 1969, The Guess Who were one of the hardest-working bands in Canada. Despite having released several strong singles, a hugely successful split LP (&quot;A Wild Pair&quot;, which also featured Ottawa's The Stacattos), and a weekly stint as house band on CBC-TV's &quot;Let's Go!&quot;, mainstream success eluded them.\n\nIn 1969 The Guess Who scored an international hit with &quot;These Eyes&quot;, co-written by Cummings and guitarist Randy Bachman. It was followed up by the hit &quot;Laughing&quot;, again written by Cummings and Bachman. Another Guess Who song, &quot;Undun&quot;, featured Cummings on a jazzy flute solo. In 1970, the band hit No. 1 in Canada with &quot;American Woman.&quot;\n\nUltimately, conflict between Cummings and bandmate Randy BachmanÃ¢â‚¬â€partially ignited by Bachman's then-deepening Mormon religious beliefsÃ¢â‚¬â€caused a rift in the band. Bachman left and went on to form the band Brave Belt with former Guess Who mate Chad Allan, and later BachmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œTurner Overdrive.\n\nCummings became the band's leader and recorded songs that included &quot;Share the Land&quot;, &quot;Hand Me Down World&quot;, &quot;Albert Flasher&quot;, &quot;Rain Dance&quot;, &quot;Sour Suite&quot;, &quot;Glamour Boy&quot;, &quot;Star Baby&quot;, &quot;Clap for the Wolfman&quot;, and &quot;Dancin' Fool&quot;.\n\nGoing Solo:\n\nIn 1975 Cummings left The Guess Who after 10 years to become a solo artist, and the group disbanded. One of his first projects included providing back-up vocals on Eric Carmen's second solo LP, Boats Against the Current, including &quot;She Did It.&quot;\n\nCummings' subsequent solo hits in Canada included &quot;Stand Tall,&quot; which was his greatest American solo hit, peaking at #10 on the Hot 100 and number two on the Adult Contemporary chart . Other hits included: &quot;I'm Scared,&quot; &quot;Break it to Them Gently,&quot; and &quot;Fine State of Affairs.&quot; Cummings charted outside Canada with &quot;Stand Tall&quot; and &quot;You Saved My Soul.&quot; His Dream of a Child album released in 1978 was the biggest[clarification needed] Canadian album in history at that time. Cummings released a total of eight solo albums and collections from 1976 to 1990. In 1997 he released a live compilation album of his solo performances entitled Up Close and Alone which was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario\n\nCummings also tried his hand at acting. He appeared along with Paul Sorvino, Glynnis O'Connor and Don Johnson in the 1982 Canadian film &quot;Melanie&quot;. His songs &quot;You Saved My Soul&quot;, &quot;Real Good&quot;, &quot;Something Old, Something New&quot; featured in the film (including album &quot;Sweet Sweet&quot; released 1981, before film released).\n\nCummings became a resident of Sherman Oaks, California, and began writing and singing for films in the late 1970s. He currently winters in California and returns to Winnipeg in the summer, living in Canada throughout autumn. [clarification needed] Besides his music, Cummings purchased part of Winnipeg's Salisbury House restaurant chain with manager Lorne Saifer, and is an avid comic book collector.\n\nFor several years Cummings has been active on My Space, blogging and posting music and photos. As of June 25, 2010, he unveiled a new website where he will continue his blog Ã¢â‚¬â€œ http://www.burtoncummings.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89241f393f80847ba793702658894caee65feca6","amp;dn":"Burton+Cummings+-+Massey+Hall+%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89241f393f80847ba793702658894caee65feca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,36,31,57,63,128,132,123,167,147,112,38,88,137,76,174,230,95,236,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
