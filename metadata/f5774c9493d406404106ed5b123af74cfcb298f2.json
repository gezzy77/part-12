The vocals are softer, smoothed over with borrowed or double-tracked harmonies, and the pep shots from more specialized styles (by the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Onward Brass Band) less speedy. The lyrics celebrate domestic satisfactions and seem to find political ambiguities more curious than ominous. None of which is bad or dishonest--it suggests a new grace and flexibility for the mass-pop mode, and invests small subjects and emotions with an almost luminous wit and awareness. But I have my doubts about Kodachrome too.&quot; B+\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5774c9493d406404106ed5b123af74cfcb298f2","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+-+There+Goes+Rhymin%27+Simon+%281973+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5774c9493d406404106ed5b123af74cfcb298f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,119,76,148,147,212,6,64,65,6,237,91,18,58,247,76,252,178,152,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
