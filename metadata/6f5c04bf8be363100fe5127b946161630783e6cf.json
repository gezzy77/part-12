Drawing heavily from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bitches BrewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it captures Miles and one of his great electric bands really firing on all cylinders.\n\nFor the original 2-LP set Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live at the Fillmore East in 1970Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, DavisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ longtime producer Teo Macero edited down each of the four nightsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ performances into one sound collage. The four Ã¢â‚¬Å“suitesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were then each placed on one side of vinyl.\n \nRecorded over four consecutive nights in June 1970 at the Fillmore East in New York City, this deluxe 4-CD package, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miles at the FillmoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, presents the four evenings in full, remixed and uncut, plus bonus tracks culled from the April 11 performances at sister venue The Fillmore West. In total, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roughly 100 minutes of never-before-released music from Wednesday through Saturday at the Fillmore East, with additional 35 or so minutes from the San Francisco show. All of the material was professionally recorded to eight-track tape in 1970 and newly mixed for this release. \n\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nMiles at the Fillmore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Miles Davis 1970:\n\nThe Bootleg Series Vol. 3\n\n2014\n\n\n 4CDs / 2014 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nDisc 1 (Fillmore East, Wednesday, June 17, 1970):\n\n1.
