The Complete Idiot's Guide to Conquering Fear and Anxiety gives the strategies, tactics, and weapons you need to slay those inner demons, so you can go on and live you life.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3039ffd08f5394df123bf1e509d39224bc6c2f5c","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Idiots+Guide+to+Conquering+Fear+and+Anxiety-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3039ffd08f5394df123bf1e509d39224bc6c2f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,57,255,208,143,83,148,223,18,59,241,229,9,211,146,36,188,108,47,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
