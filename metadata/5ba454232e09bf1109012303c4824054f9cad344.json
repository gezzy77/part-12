Released in Japan on March 6, 2004, with a U.S. release on September 17, 2004, Innocence had a production budget of approximately $20 million (approx. 2 billion yen)[1]. To raise such a large amount of money, Production I.G's president Mitsuhisa Ishikawa asked Studio Ghibli's president Toshio Suzuki to work on the project with him as a co-producer. The film is written and directed by Mamoru Oshii, with a story loosely connected to the manga by Shirow Masamune. The movie was produced by Production I.G, which also produced the original movie and the spinoff TV series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.\n\nIn order to better market the film outside of Japan, the Ghost in the Shell 2 moniker was added to the title of the film, with Innocence simply becoming the subtitle. This was seen by some fans as conflicting with Oshii's statements that the film wasn't in actuality a standard Hollywood-esque sequel, and was able to and intended to stand alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba454232e09bf1109012303c4824054f9cad344","amp;dn":"Ghost_in_the_Shell_-_Innocence_%5B3xR%5D%5BBlu-ray.1080p.H264.AC3%5D%5B7C2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba454232e09bf1109012303c4824054f9cad344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,164,84,35,46,9,191,17,9,1,35,3,196,130,64,84,249,202,211,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
