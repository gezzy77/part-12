Naked Man In The Sky\n\nALDO is a band of brothes: Andre Faria (bass, guitar, vocals) and Murilo Faria (synths, keyboards, backing vocals).\n\nFrom Sao Paulo, Brazil, the bands name is a tribute to the brothers uncle Aldo, a crazy dude from the 80s responsible for taking his nephews - while still kids - in a crazy journey to the night of Sao Paulo in a fear and loathing in Las Vegas style, with unpredictable endings.\n\nThe uncle went to church to regret his sins in the end of the 90s and the brothers decided to exorcise those memories with the record Ã¢â‚¬Å“IS LOVEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nWith a mix of eletronic beats, synths, bass and guitars, the band aims the nightclub. The references goes from Happy Mondays, Prince and Chic to LCD Soundsystem, Chemical Brothers and some brazilian soul and funk bands from 70s, like Maria Fumaca and Eumir Deodato.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5d39f1f76b5b057cbb374fae94de466460b2bf","amp;dn":"Aldo+-+Is+Love+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5d39f1f76b5b057cbb374fae94de466460b2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,93,57,241,247,107,91,5,124,187,55,79,174,148,222,70,100,96,178,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
