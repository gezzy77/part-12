You can use Folder Guard to lock your personal files and folders with passwords, to stop other users from peeking into your records. You can even completely hide your private folders from virtually all applications, and such folders would remain invisible until you enter a valid password. You can also protect sensitive system files from modification or destruction, disable access to the removable drives, restrict access to Control Panel, and more.\r\n\r\nYou can protect with password virtually any folder, allowing only authorized users to open the protected files or folders. You can password-protect an unlimited number of folders, each with its own password, or you can use the Master Password of Folder Guard to unprotect them all at once.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: http://www.winability.com/folderguard/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7690321b46cfe681792f14a84c5ec99e34d62546","amp;dn":"WinAbility+Folder+Guard+v10.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7690321b46cfe681792f14a84c5ec99e34d62546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,144,50,27,70,207,230,129,121,47,20,168,76,94,201,158,52,214,37,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
