In this course, author Joseph LeBlanc shows how to build an entire web application with CouchDB and introduces techniques such as querying with JavaScript, working with nested data, and creating views. He also explains some of the trade-offs you might encounter with NoSQL databases, such as the complexity of partitioning data across multiple servers, and presents five commonly used NoSQL databases: CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, and Redis.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\nWhat is NoSQL?\r\nInstalling CouchDB on Mac, Windows, and Linux\r\nStoring data\r\nNesting document data\r\nSpecifying search criteria\r\nReducing data\r\nAttaching and retrieving images\r\nDeploying applications\r\nSecuring CouchDB\r\nUnderstanding the CAP theorem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a58c8866ed7f597bb0e799b90ce5b09c28b1f1","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+NoSQL+Databases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a58c8866ed7f597bb0e799b90ce5b09c28b1f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,165,140,136,102,237,127,89,123,176,231,153,185,12,229,176,156,40,177,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
