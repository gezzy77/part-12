Filmed with a camera in a waterproof housing strapped to GreenoughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back, the sequence is composed entirely of slow-motion footage shot inside the curl of waves, edited to the 23-minute song &quot;Echoes&quot; by Pink Floyd. The group reportedly allowed Elfick and Greenough to use the music in their film in exchange for the use of Greenough's footage as a visual background when they performed &quot;Echoes&quot; in concert.\n\nCrystal Voyager is a 1973 surf film directed by David Elfick. \nCrystal Voyager premiered at the Sydney Opera House on 5 December 1973 and had a successful three-week run there before opening in other states. The theatrical 35mm version of the film is different to the original 16mm release and was re-edited by Elfick and Greenough. It became one of Australia's most successful surf films, grossing more than AU$100,000 (1973 figures) on its initial Australian release, before being picked up by British Hemdale Corporation. Crystal Voyager gained substantial press on its release, mostly due to its strong reception at the Cannes Film Festival and it had a record-breaking 6-month run in London's West End, where it played a double bill with Rene Laloux's animated science-fiction film Fantastic Planet, grossing more than UKÃ‚Â£100,000 pounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681b45972f31f94eefb68d43ea06c5d03d21c5c5","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Echoes+with+Chrystal+Voyager","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681b45972f31f94eefb68d43ea06c5d03d21c5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,27,69,151,47,49,249,78,239,182,141,67,234,6,197,208,61,33,197,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
