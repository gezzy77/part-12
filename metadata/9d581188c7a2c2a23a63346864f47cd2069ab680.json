Hard-hitting topics saturate this collection of songs, ranging from false prophets to dying to oneself and even touching on abortion from the child's perspective.\n\n&quot;Rock and roll was born out of this experience that people were having. They loved the huge sound; they loved the big lights, the big stages, the big guitars...&quot; Justin cordle states.\n\n&quot;I think the reason people come to shows is because they want to be entertained...it's still an entertainment business. We love rock and roll and the show and everything that the people love, so we try to do it as big and as bad as we can.&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n1.\t        Hypocrite\t\t\t 3:37\t \n2.\t\tDeliverance\t\t\t 3:47\t \n3.\t\tFrom Death Life Comes\t         3:10\t \n4.\t\tWhere We Are\t\t\t 4:49\t \n5.\t\tWrong And Right\t\t\t 3:57\t \n6.\t\tRedemption\t\t\t 3:14\t \n7.\t\tMartyr's Theme\t\t\t 4:24\t \n8.\t\tBreaking Away\t\t\t 3:22\t \n9.\t\tMessed Up\t\t\t 4:05\t                           10.\t\tUntil We're Dead                 5:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d581188c7a2c2a23a63346864f47cd2069ab680","amp;dn":"We+As+Human+-+Until+We%5C%27re+Dead+%5B2007%5D+%2AEDIV%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d581188c7a2c2a23a63346864f47cd2069ab680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,88,17,136,199,162,194,162,58,99,52,104,100,244,124,210,6,154,182,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
