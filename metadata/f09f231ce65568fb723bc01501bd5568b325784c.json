It's a rather disreputable crew that teams for the elaborate jewel theft masterminded by Maximillian Schell. Sexy Melina Mercouri (Mrs. Dassin) is probably the best of the batch: the others are faffling Robert Morley, unreliable Gilles Segal and Jess Hahn. Bumbling Peter Ustinov (who won an Oscar for his performance) is duped into helping the thieves, and soon finds himself uneasily straddling both sides of the law. As in Rififi, the theft itself (taking place in Istanbul's Topkapi Palace museum) is played out in near-complete silence. We won't tell you how the crooks are foiled; just be advised that money flies out the door when something else flies in the window. Topkapi was based on The Light of Day, a somewhat more somber novel by Eric Ambler. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058672/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058672/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search2/sublanguageid-all/moviename-topkapi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search2/sublanguageid-all/moviename-topkapi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:54:54\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x416 1.73:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1536 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 160 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09f231ce65568fb723bc01501bd5568b325784c","amp;dn":"Topkapi+%281964%29+Melina+Mercouri+Eng+%28multisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09f231ce65568fb723bc01501bd5568b325784c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,159,35,28,230,85,104,251,114,59,192,21,1,189,85,104,179,37,120,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
