He began his writing career in 1998, at age twenty-eight, when the first of four Nick Travers novels was published. In 2001, he earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for his investigation into a 1950s murder. That murder inspired his 2006 novel White Shadow, which was followed by three further history-based crime novels, Wicked City, DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Garden, and Infamous. His Quinn Colson novels include The Ranger, The Lost Ones, and The Broken Places. Atkins lives in Oxford, Mississippi.\n\nQuinn Colson:\nThe Ranger (#1): After years of war, Army Ranger Quinn Colson returns home to the rugged, rough hill country of northeast Mississippi to find his native Tibbehah County overrun with corruption, decay, meth runners, and violence. His uncle, the longtime county sheriff, is dead. A suicide, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s told, but othersÃ¢â‚¬â€like tomboy deputy Lillie VirgilÃ¢â‚¬â€whisper murder.\n\nIn the days that follow, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Colson to discover the truth, not only about his uncle, but about his family, his friends, his town, and himself. And once itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovered, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no going back for this real hero of the Deep South.\n\nThe Lost Ones (#2): When Army Ranger Quinn Colson, the new sheriff of Tebbehah County, is called out to investigate a child abuse case, what he finds is a horrifying scene of neglect, thirteen empty cribs, and a shoe box full of money. Janet and Ramon Torres seem to have skipped townÃ¢â‚¬â€but ColsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll come back for the cash.\n\nMeanwhile, ColsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister has returnedÃ¢â‚¬â€clean and sober for good she says. His friend Boom has been drinking himself into oblivion and picking fights at the local bar. And his old flame is pregnant. But Colson canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t focus on his personal problems. He and Deputy Lillie Virgil are convinced that Janet and Ramon have a taste for guns, drugs, and human trafficking. Soon Colson and Virgil find a link between the fugitive couple and a drug cartel that controls most of the Texas border, taking their investigation far beyond the rough hills of northeast MississippiÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Broken Places (#3): A year after becoming sheriff, Quinn Colson is faced with the release of an infamous murderer from prison. Jamey Dixon comes back to Jericho preaching redemption, and some believe him; but for the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, the only thought is revenge.\n\nAnother group who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe himÃ¢â‚¬â€the men in prison from DixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last job, an armored car robbery. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sure heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone back to grab the hidden money, so they do the only thing they can: break out and head straight to Jericho themselves.\n\nColson and his deputy, Lillie, know theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got their work cut out for them. But they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on one more unwelcome visitor: a tornado that causes havoc just as events come to a head. Communications are down, the roads are impassableÃ¢â‚¬â€and the rule of law is just about to snap.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.
