Arrogant, obsessed with military form and ultimately self-destructive, Thursday attempts to destroy the Apache chief Cochise after luring him across the border from Mexico, against the advice of his subordinates.\n\nQuality is ok for VHS.  You can see a problem with some of the contrast.  Other than that is seems ok.\n\nI&amp;#039;ll post the specs later in a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c6736b52673b9e72e13f48207a6e983f00b974","amp;dn":"Western+-+John+Wayne+-+Fort+Apache+%281948%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c6736b52673b9e72e13f48207a6e983f00b974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,198,115,107,82,103,59,158,114,225,63,72,32,122,110,152,63,0,185,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
