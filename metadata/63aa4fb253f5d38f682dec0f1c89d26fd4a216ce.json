They finished as runners-up in the sixth series of Britain's Got Talent in 2012, being beaten to the winning post on 12 May by dancing dog act Ashleigh and Pudsey.[1] At the time, they were aged 17 and 16 respectively. Despite not winning, the young duo were offered a Ã‚Â£1million record deal by Simon Cowell on his record label Syco. They have since released their album Together which reached No. 5 in the UK Album Charts. The album was released in the USA and Canada on October 30, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                   Jonathan &amp; Charlotte - Together\n\n\nArtist...............: Jonathan &amp; Charlotte\nAlbum................: Together\nGenre................: Classical\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Samsung CDRW/DVD SH-S202J\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: [TFM] on 2013.06.01.\nPosted by............: [TFM] on 2013.06.01.\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: ahashare.sounds.FLAC\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U, LOG, \nCovers...............: Front Back \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
