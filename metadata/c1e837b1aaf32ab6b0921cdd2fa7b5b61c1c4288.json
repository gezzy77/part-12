As same-sex Ã¢â‚¬Å“unionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and court challenges to the bans on these unions sweep the country, reasoned voices from the Church are needed. Now, one has emerged to expose the agenda that the homosexual mafia is trying to impose on society. Dr. Ronnie W. Floyd tackles the problems confronting the traditional family with this issue - in schools, the workplace, the church, and even within your home.\nRevealing the progress the gay agenda has already made, Dr. Floyd also examines the legal background and challenges dominating media reports almost daily. Floyd highlights why Christians need to be aware of this issue and its assault upon the faith, as well as showing from Scripture that the homosexual lifestyle is definitely at odds with GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan for the family. With a balanced, methodical, and loving manner, Floyd issues an urgent call to pastors, parents, and educators: passive response wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work - only prayer and engagement with the issues will be effective.\n\nAbout the author:\nSince 1986, Pastor Floyd has served as the Senior Pastor of Cross Church, Northwest Arkansas.
