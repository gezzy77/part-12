Now, one of the yoga worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top female teachers shows you an enlightened way to a powerful core. Unlike repetitive conventional abs work, ShivaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fluid yoga-based approach awakens your creativity and inner fire, building strength and grace in the same way that surfing, rock climbing, or dancing doesÃ¢â‚¬â€while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re enjoying yourself, not counting the minutes until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over. The program includes three flowing segments, which can be done all at once or individually.\n\nFilmed at White Sands National Park, the program was directed by James Wvinner and shot in HD by HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sion Michel (Memoirs of a Geisha). Beautiful, effective, inspiring. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an abs workout youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look forward to doing again and again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1917ddb4120b974b62cab4dcd66596dd33ed4d3a","amp;dn":"Shiva+Rea-+Creative+Core+Abs.iso+%28Yoga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1917ddb4120b974b62cab4dcd66596dd33ed4d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,23,221,180,18,11,151,75,98,202,180,220,214,101,150,221,51,237,77,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
