I usually mention that i have several hundreds of gigabytes of material about Psychology, Science, Philosophy and Spirituality and that Jack Kornfield is the most rewarding of it all in my humble opinion. His work has so much of both intelligence and heart and that is what really impresses me.\nKornfield has been a buddhist monk for many years and also got a Ph.D in psychology. You do not at all have to be into buddhism to find this material highly interesting and valuable.\n\nOn the product page its written: &quot; Perfect enlightenment appears in many texts, Kornfield begins. But how is it viewed among Western teachers and practitioners? To find out, Kornfield talked to more than one hundred Zen masters, rabbis, nuns, lamas, monks, and senior meditation students from all walks of life. The result is this extraordinary look at the hard work we all must do ? the laundry ? no matter how often we experience ecstatic states of consciousness through meditation and other disciplines. &quot; If you wonder which Kornfield audio i belive i the best i have to say &quot;Roots of buddhist psychology&quot;. It has had an enourmous influence, a master piece recorded in front of a live audience.
