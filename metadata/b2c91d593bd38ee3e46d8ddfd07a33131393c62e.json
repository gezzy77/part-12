Tim Rice's liner notes accompanying THE ULTIMATE BEE GEES puts the group's extravagant popularity into perspective. 'Within this package is a collection of performances and songs that very few practitioners of popular music of the past could match for quality, originality, and emotion. It's the singing, the harmonies, the arrangements, the sound, the rivalry, the love, the intelligence, the determination, but above all it's the\nsongs.'\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.You should be dancing                                [04:16]\n02.Stayin' alive                                        [04:43]\n03.Jive talkin'                                         [03:44]\n04.Nights on broadway                                   [04:34]\n05.Tragedy                                              [05:02]\n06.Night fever                                          [03:32]\n07.More than A woman                                    [03:17]\n08.Fanny (be tender with my love)                       [04:04]\n09.Spirits having flown                                 [05:12]\n10.If I can't have you                                  [03:20]\n11.Boogie child                                         [04:12]\n12.Love you inside out                                  [04:11]\n13.You win again                                        [04:01]\n14.One                                                  [04:53]\n15.Secret love                                          [03:32]\n16.Alone                                                [04:50]\n17.Still waters (run deep)                              [04:08]\n18.This is where I came in                              [04:53]\n19.Spicks and specks (live)                             [02:25]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.How deep is your love                                [04:02]\n02.To love somebody                                     [03:01]\n03.Words                                                [03:18]\n04.How can you mend A broken heart                      [03:58]\n05.Too much heaven                                      [04:56]\n06.Emotion                                              [03:39]\n07.Lonely days                                          [03:47]\n08.Run to me                                            [03:13]\n09.Love so right                                        [03:37]\n10.For whom the bell tolls                              [03:58]\n11.I've gotta get A message to you                      [03:04]\n12.New york mining disaster 1941                        [02:10]\n13.Massachusetts                                        [02:21]\n14.I started A joke                                     [03:09]\n15.World                                                [03:18]\n16.First of may                                         [02:50]\n17.Holiday                                              [02:55]\n18.Don't forget to remember                             [03:31]\n19.Islands in the stream [live]                         [03:47]\n20.Heartbreaker.
