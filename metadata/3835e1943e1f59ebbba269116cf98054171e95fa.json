Dr. South has expanded the chapter on utilization with another section dealing with pain control. The chapter dealing with ethics and the law has been significantly updated as well. Overall, this definitive training manual provides a systematic approach to thoroughly learning about the topic and is set against a clinical background. It is a thoroughly practical resource that assumes no previous knowledge of the field and develops the reader's understanding. It includes: the history of hypnosis, myths and misconceptions, traditional vs. non-traditional inductions, basic and advanced inductions, language forms, utilization of ideodynamic responses, hypnotherapy without trance, basic and advanced metaphor, and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3835e1943e1f59ebbba269116cf98054171e95fa","amp;dn":"Ericksonian+Approaches%3A+A+Comprehensive+Manua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3835e1943e1f59ebbba269116cf98054171e95fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,53,225,148,62,31,89,235,187,162,105,17,108,249,128,84,23,30,149,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
