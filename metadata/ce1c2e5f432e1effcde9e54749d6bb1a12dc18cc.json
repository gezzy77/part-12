IP routing is at the core of Internet technology and expedient troubleshooting of IP routing failures is key to reducing network downtime and crucial for sustaining mission-critical applications carried over the Internet. Though troubleshooting skills are in great demand, few networking professionals possess the knowledge to identify and rectify networking problems quickly and efficiently. Troubleshooting IP Routing Protocols provides working solutions necessary for networking engineers who are pressured to acquire expert-level skills at a momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s notice. This book also serves as an additional study aid for CCIE candidates.\n\nAuthored by Cisco Systems engineers in the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and the Internet Support Engineering Team who troubleshoot IP routing protocols on a daily basis, Troubleshooting IP Routing Protocols goes through a step-by-step process to solving real-world problems. Based on the authorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ combined years of experience, this complete reference alternates between chapters that cover the key aspects of a given routing protocol and chapters that concentrate on the troubleshooting steps an engineer would take to resolve the most common routing problems related to a variety of routing protocols. The book provides extensive, practical coverage of BGP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, multicasting, and RIP as run on Cisco IOS Software network devices.\n\nTroubleshooting IP Routing Protocols offers you a full understanding of invaluable troubleshooting techniques that help keep your network operating at peak performance. Whether you are looking to hone your support skills or to prepare for the challenging CCIE exams, this essential reference shows you how to isolate and resolve common network failures and to sustain optimal network operation.\n\nThis book is part of the Cisco CCIE Professional Development Series, which offers expert-level instruction on network design, deployment, and support methodologies to help networking professionals manage complex networks and prepare for CCIE exams.\n\nBook Details\nHardcover: 912 pages\nPublisher: Cisco Press (May 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1587050196\nISBN-13: 978-1587050190","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1c2e5f432e1effcde9e54749d6bb1a12dc18cc","amp;dn":"Cisco.Press.Troubleshooting.IP.Routing.Protocols.May.2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1c2e5f432e1effcde9e54749d6bb1a12dc18cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,28,46,95,67,46,30,255,205,233,229,71,73,214,187,26,18,220,24,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
