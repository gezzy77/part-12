A determining influence on the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel and the Beach Boys, they brought the ethereal harmonies of the Appalachian Mountains to the wild mix of rock 'n' roll.\n\nFirst broadcast in 1984 as part of their reunion after ten bitter years apart, Arena traces their fabulous career, their split and triumphant reunion. Most of all, Don and Phil wanted to revisit their roots in the coal mining area of Kentucky where their father Ike, a miner, had been a local guitar star. He too had played with his coal mining brothers, in the 30s. In the moody atmosphere of Muhlenberg County, they have an emotional reunion with three generations of Everlys.\n\nWith contributions from master musician and producer Chet Atkins, songwriters Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and the legendary guitar singer and ex-coal miner, Ike's close friend Mose Rager.butchery business.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn the autumn of 1983, the Everly Brothers played their legendary reunion concerts in London. Of all the venues in the world, they chose the Royal Albert Hall because they had treasured memories of playing there with their father Ike, a guitar virtuoso in his own right. All London was there and it was such an event that the filming was fed live into the BBC 9 o'clock News. After their acrimonious split, which had lasted ten years, Arena's cameras proved that they and their unique, beautiful sound were as magical as ever.\n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n \n \n\n \nArena - The Everly Brothers Songs Of Innocence And Experience (95 Minutes)\nArena - The Everly Brothers Reunion Concert (1983)  (75 Minutes)\n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : The Everly Brothers.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 1.09 GB\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 35mn\nTotal bitrate               : 1 642 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 35mn\nBitrate                     : 1 379 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.184\nStream size                 : 940 MB (84%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 2\nCodec Id                    : 50\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 35mn\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 175 MB (16%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86baf11b8b73fae4e112bdb1eea31fac895f6f6","amp;dn":"Everly+Brothers+Songs+Of+Innocence+And+Experience+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86baf11b8b73fae4e112bdb1eea31fac895f6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,107,175,17,184,183,63,174,78,17,43,219,30,234,49,250,200,149,246,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
