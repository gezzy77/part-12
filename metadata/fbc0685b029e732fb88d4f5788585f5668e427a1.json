In addition to painting a picture of Hemingway's time as a struggling young writer, the book also sketches the story of Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley.\n\nA Moveable Feast is considered by many to contain some of his best writing. Some of the prominent people to make an appearance in the book include Aleister Crowley, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, Hilaire Belloc, Pascin, John Dos Passos, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. The book was edited by Ernest's fourth wife, Mary Hemingway, and published in 1964, four years after Hemingway's death.\n\nThe book contains Hemingway's personal accounts, observations, and stories of his experience in 1920s Paris. He provides the detail of specific addresses of cafes, bars, hotels, and apartments that still can be found in modern day Paris. The title was suggested by Hemingway's friend A.E. Hotchner, author of Papa Hemingway, and comes from a conversation the two once had about the city during Hotchner's first visits there:\n\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.&quot;\n\n - - -\n\nFrom Recorded Books:\n\nThis is Ernest HemingwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memoir of his time in exuberant post-WWI Paris. Portraits of the expatriate luminaries he befriended there include those of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound.\n\n&quot;If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always a chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact.&quot; --Ernest Hemingway, from the Preface\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc0685b029e732fb88d4f5788585f5668e427a1","amp;dn":"A+MOVEABLE+FEAST+-+Ernest+Hemingway.+James+Naughton+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc0685b029e732fb88d4f5788585f5668e427a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,192,104,91,2,158,115,47,184,141,79,87,136,88,95,86,104,228,39,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
