In other words, it contains every known recording Drake made during his brief lifetime, and listening to the set, the depth of his talent becomes abundantly clear. And the four discs are not overkill. The quality of Drake's songs was startlingly high, and anyone who purchases one disc will eventually need the other three albums, making Fruit Tree a logical way to acquire all of the records at once.\n\n  Bio\n\n  A singular talent who passed almost unnoticed during his brief lifetime, Nick Drake produced several albums of chilling, somber beauty. With hindsight, these have come to be recognized as peak achievements of both the British folk-rock scene and the entire rock singer/songwriter genre. Sometimes compared to Van Morrison, Drake in fact resembled Donovan much more in his breathy vocals, strong melodies, and the acoustic-based orchestral sweep of his arrangements. His was a much darker vision than Donovan's, however, with disturbing themes of melancholy, failed romance, mortality, and depression lurking just beneath, or even well above, the surface. Ironically, Drake has achieved a far greater stature in the decades following his death, with an avid cult following that grows by the year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a44849e6f8144b18f5bcc3f0c28cc81214434f9","amp;dn":"Nick+Drake+-+Fruit+Tree+-+Discography+%281986%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a44849e6f8144b18f5bcc3f0c28cc81214434f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,68,132,158,111,129,68,177,143,91,204,63,12,40,204,129,33,68,52,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
