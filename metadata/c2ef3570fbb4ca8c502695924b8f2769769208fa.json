He was Napoleon, one of the most brilliant and complex figures in history. This absorbing appraisal of his life offers a new perspective of the little man from Corsica, who rose to new heights of power by seizing every brutal, outrageous opportunity in his path. \nIn 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, a native of Corsica, crowned himself emperor of France, an audacious gesture that illustrated his overweening pride and ruthless ambition. Despite his diminutive stature, &quot;the little corporal&quot; loomed large over much of Europe for two decades-as an adroit statesman, military strategist and ruthless conqueror. This sweeping documentary reveals the private tribulations as well as the public triumphs of a complex historical legend. From the glory of his empire to his defeat at Waterloo and miserable exile on Elba, here is an entertaining and complete portrait of an extraordinary life.\n\nNarrated by Robert Whelan\nExecutive Producers : Bob Carruthers ; Gary Russell\nProducers : Gavin Bott ; Audrey Healy\nDirected and Edited by Chris Gormlie\nCromwell Productions 2001\n\n\n\n\n2)  The Early Campaigns \nMarriage to Josephine de Beauharnais did little to quell Napoleon's vaulting ambition. Now he had the opportunity to display his burgeoning military talents, which he showed to full effect during his stunning first Italian campaign. It saw Napoleon win the respect of his officers and gain the love of his men merely by ensuring that, for the first time in years, they were paid properly. After his triumphant return to Paris in 1797, Napoleon was already planning his invasion of Europe. This episode covers all these events plus the invasion of Egypt and the battle of the Pyramids, ending with Napoleon's rise to First Consul in 1799.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6352/napoleonthemanthemythth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2056 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x536\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.313:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 47:51.600\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 795 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ef3570fbb4ca8c502695924b8f2769769208fa","amp;dn":"HC+Napoleon+The+Man+The+Myth+The+Legend+2of6+The+Early+Campaigns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ef3570fbb4ca8c502695924b8f2769769208fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,239,53,112,251,180,202,140,80,38,149,146,75,143,39,105,118,146,8,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
