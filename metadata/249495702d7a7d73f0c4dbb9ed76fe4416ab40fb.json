Example confirmed that much like the previous album, there would be no collaborations, besides that of producers (including frequent collaborator Skream). During an interview, Example revealed the forthcoming album would remain dance oriented, although he would make a gradual move into electronic and dubstep genres.\n\nThe lead single from the album, &quot;Changed the Way You Kiss Me&quot;, was released on the 5 June 2011. The single debuted at No.1 in the charts. It will be followed by his second single &quot;Stay Awake&quot;, which is produced by Nero. The collaboration between Example and Laidback Luke which appears on the album will see release as the third single on 2 October in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Example - Playing In The Shadows\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Example\nAlbum................: Playing In The Shadows\nGenre................: Dance\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2011\nRipper...............: Lame 3.92 &amp; \nCodec................: FhG\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\n\nIncluded.............: M3U, Front\nCovers...............: Front \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
