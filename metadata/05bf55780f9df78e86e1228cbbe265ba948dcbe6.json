She has done the unthinkable: died so she might continue to live. Now Allie, the reluctant teenage vampire who was cast out of Eden, and Zeke, the human boy who loves her, must attempt to save the world from a deadly new strain of plague. In order to do so, they must first hunt down the monster who holds the promise of the cureÃ¢â‚¬â€and AllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved mentorÃ¢â‚¬â€in his sadistic grip.... Joined by AllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood brother, Jackal, this unlikely posse of companions will brave a landscape stalked by raiders, rabids, and rogue vampires. But even if they survive, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bound for the Inner city, and a vicious showdown that will test their bonds in ways they never expected. It may just be that becoming undead was the easy part. Confronting the horrors of AllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awakening hunger, her growing feelings for Zeke, and the uncertainties of their future is going to be the ultimate challenge.\n\nGenre: Young Adult, Paranormal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05bf55780f9df78e86e1228cbbe265ba948dcbe6","amp;dn":"The+Eternity+Cure+-+Julie+Kagawa.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05bf55780f9df78e86e1228cbbe265ba948dcbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,191,85,120,15,157,247,142,134,225,34,140,187,226,101,186,148,141,203,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
