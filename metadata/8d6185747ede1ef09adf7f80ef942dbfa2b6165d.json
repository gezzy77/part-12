Apart from the enhanced graphics, these impressive new features include:\n\n    Improved Total Terrain system that now provides the ability to snap to both polylines and measured points.\n    New vector-based printing system.\n    Automated articulation model with simulated off tracking.\n    Total station points protection with the ability to track changes.\n    Ability to create custom buildings, signs, and animated traffic lights.\n    Leading-edge crush editor with damage automatically synced to impacts.\n    Environmental effects such as snow, fog, and rain.\n    Advanced animation effects including shadows, turning wheels, and spinning tires.\n    New expanded snap options and CAD tools, including a snip feature.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE                                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious                                                   torrents                                                                                                                                                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1700+ torrents                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\t\t\t\ncredit to the original creator encoder \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6185747ede1ef09adf7f80ef942dbfa2b6165d","amp;dn":"ARAS+360+HD+2.0.5.0+Patch+And+Custom-MPT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6185747ede1ef09adf7f80ef942dbfa2b6165d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,97,133,116,126,222,30,240,154,223,127,128,239,148,45,191,162,182,22,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
