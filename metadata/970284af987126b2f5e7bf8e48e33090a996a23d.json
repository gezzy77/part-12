A TASER CEW is a hand-held device that delivers a 400-volt pulse with a duration tuned to control the skeletal muscles without affecting the heart at a distance of up to 6.5 meters over tiny wires. If necessary, it begins with an arcing voltage of 50,000 V to penetrate thick clothing; the 50,000 V is never delivered to the body itself. Due to the widespread usage of these devices and the widespread misconceptions surrounding their operation, this book will have significant utility. This volume is written for cardiologists, emergency physicians, pathologists, law enforcement management, corrections personnel, and attorneys.\n\n\nHardcover: 460 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 1 edition (March 19, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0387854746\nISBN-13: 978-0387854748","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970284af987126b2f5e7bf8e48e33090a996a23d","amp;dn":"TASER+Conducted+Electrical+Weapons+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970284af987126b2f5e7bf8e48e33090a996a23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,2,132,175,152,113,38,178,245,231,191,142,72,227,48,144,169,150,162,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
