It is one of the early cult albums in rock history, and is still popular among fans today. It was released in 1972, and was the primary vehicle/effort for the Vangelis project. It had a minor Album Oriented Radio hit in &quot;The Four Horsemen,&quot; and a nearly pop hit with &quot;Break.&quot; The album was ostensibly an adaptation of Biblical passages from the book of the same name, but was also very experimental in lyrics and composition, including a curious piece of performance art in which Greek actress Irene Papas performs a struggle to chant a mantra while in the throes of hysteria and sexual climax.\nEssentially, 666 was Vangelis' concept, created with an outside lyricist, Costas Ferris. The music that Vangelis was creating for 666 was much more psychedelic and progressive rock oriented than anything the band had done before. The music itself was an impressive display of Vangelis' abilities, combining psychedelic and progressive rock with ethnic instruments, choral chanting, recitations, and very advanced use of synthesizers and keyboards for the time. In time the album became recognized as one of the most important early progressive rock works, and a defining example of the concept album. 666 also made Vangelis an underground name to watch, and in 1974 earned him an offer from Jon Anderson to join Yes following the departure of Rick Wakeman.\n\nJust before the release of the album Vangelis engaged in a long fight with Mercury Records over the content of the album. The record company, in particular, objected to the song &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾&quot; (infinity), which they considered obscene. It consisted of Irene Papas chanting the words &quot;I was, I am, I am to come&quot; over and over again in various stages of hysteria, while Vangelis accompanied her on a maelstrom of percussion (the five-minute finished track was reportedly edited down from a 39-minute piece recorded in a single take). However, the double-album length of 666 and the musical experimentation, as well as the subject matter, also exacerbated Mercury's ire. Another bone of contention was the sleeve note stating &quot;This album was recorded under the influence of Sahlep.&quot; This was at first suspected to be either a drug or some form of occult ritual; in fact it is a drink popular around the eastern Mediterranean and made from the dried powdered roots of a type of orchid. After Roussos and Sideras had already released their first solo albums, Mercury finally agreed to release 666 one year after completion and two years after Roussos, Sideras and Koulouris had finished their parts in it, on its progressive rock subsidiary Vertigo Records. The single &quot;Break&quot; also came out in 1972.\n\nCurrent fans and critics typically rate 666 as the group's finest effort; Allmusic gives it 4ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ stars (although their review does say &quot;the entire set eventually becomes too overwhelming to sit through&quot;). IGN rated the album #3 on their top 25 list of the best prog rock albums. In the Q &amp; Mojo Classic Special Edition 'Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock', the album came #40 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. \n \nTracklist\nA1 The System\nA2 Babylon\nA3 Loud, Loud, Loud\nA4 The Four Horsemen\nA5 The Lamb\nA6 The Seventh Seal\n \n \nB1 Aegian Sea\nB2 Seven Bowls\nB3 The Wakening Beast\nB4 Lament\nB5 The Marching Beast\nB6 The Battle Of The Locusts\nB7 Do It\nB8 Tribulation\nB9 The Beast\nB10 Ofis\n \nC1 Seven Trumpets\nC2 Altamont\nC3 The Wedding Of The Lamb\nC4 The Capture Of The Beast\nC5 8\nC6 Hic Et Nunc\n \nD1 All The Seats Were Occupied\nD2 Break\n \nPersonnel\nSilver Koulouris - guitar, percussion, baritone guitar\nDemis Roussos - bass, guitar, vocals, background vocals\nLucas Sideras - drums, vocals, background vocals, snare drums\nVangelis - organ, bass, flute, percussion, piano, keyboards, background vocals, vibraphone\n\nGuest musician\nJohn Frost - vocals\nHarris Halkitis - bass, percussion, conga, drums, saxophone, tenor sax, vocals, background vocals, snare drums\nIrene Papas - vocals\nMichel Ripoche - trombone, saxophone, tenor sax\nVannis Tsarouchis - vocals\n\nProduction\nHans Brethouwer - mastering\nGerard Fallec - production coordination\nMinoru Harada - product manager\nRoger Roche - engineer\nHitoshi Takieguchi - mastering engineer\nKiyoshi Tokiwa - art coordinator\nVangelis Papathanassiou - producer\n \nTechnical Information:\nWashed LP - AT120E - Dual CS 505-3 - Kenwood C1 - Gold platted Cable - Edirol R09HR @ 24/96 - Sandisc Extreme III SDHC Card  HDD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd64c5a82bd48e3098567a9073557e95f421cf4c","amp;dn":"Aphrodite%5C%27s+Child+-+666+%5BVinyl%5D+%5BFLAC%5D-luckburz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd64c5a82bd48e3098567a9073557e95f421cf4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,100,197,168,43,212,142,48,152,86,122,144,115,85,126,149,244,33,207,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
