Photos taken by Wright's associates show rare views of Taliesin under construction and illustrate Wright's own recollections of the first summer there and the craftsmen who worked on the site.\n\nThe book also brings to life WrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;kindred spirit,&quot; &quot;she for whom Taliesin had first taken form,&quot; Mamah Borthwick. Wright and Borthwick had each abandoned their families to be together, causing a scandal that reverberated far beyond Wright's beloved Wisconsin valley. The shocking murder and fire that took place at Taliesin in August 1914 brought this first phase of life at Taliesin to a tragic end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8935113a87028f07d612fd8b319271c534034453","amp;dn":"Building+Taliesin+-+Frank+Lloyd+Wright%27s+Home+of+Love+and+Loss+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8935113a87028f07d612fd8b319271c534034453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,53,17,58,135,2,143,7,214,18,253,139,49,146,113,197,52,3,68,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
