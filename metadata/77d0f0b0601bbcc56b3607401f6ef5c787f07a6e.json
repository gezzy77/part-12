Their trademark style fresh, crisp and faithful to the original (bumps and blemishes included) brings the story of nave, truth-telling Prince Myshkin to new life. As is true of their other translations of Dostoyevski, this will likely be the definitive edition for years to come.\n\naudio\naudiobook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d0f0b0601bbcc56b3607401f6ef5c787f07a6e","amp;dn":"%5BAudiobook%5D+Fyodor+Dostoyevsky+-+The+Idiot+%28Abridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d0f0b0601bbcc56b3607401f6ef5c787f07a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,208,240,176,96,27,188,197,107,54,7,64,31,110,245,199,135,240,122,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
