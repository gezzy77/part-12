Brand, though, responded in style: &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not voting out of apathy, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class which has been going on for generations now, and which has now reached fever pitch where you have a disenfranchised, disillusioned, despondent underclass that is not being represented by that political system, and voting is tacit complicity with that system.&quot;\n\nHowever, a bad-tempered Paxman wasn't entirely on board with this, calling Brand &quot;a very trivial man&quot;. To which Brand replied: &quot;Trivial? A minute ago you were having a go at me because I want a revolution!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c8580f788bec06d2e9ea01b1efafe22684cb1ba","amp;dn":"Russell+Brand+-+Revolution+of+Consciousness+-+New+Statesman+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c8580f788bec06d2e9ea01b1efafe22684cb1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,133,128,247,136,190,192,109,46,158,160,27,30,250,254,34,104,76,177,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
