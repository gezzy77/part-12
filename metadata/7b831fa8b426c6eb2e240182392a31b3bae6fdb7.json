Before he can do so however, the Count gains the upper hand and Harker soon finds himself as one of the walking dead. Dracula has taken an interest in Harker's fiancÃƒÂ©e, Lucy Holmwood and it is left to Harker's colleague, Dr. Van Helsing to protect her. He has difficulty convincing Lucy's brother, Arthur Holmwood, of the dangers or even the existence of vampires. Soon, however, Arthur's wife Mina is targeted by Count Dracula and he and Van Helsing race to find his lair before she is lost to them forever.\n\nVideo and audio information:\n\nVideo : 1.29 GB, 2319 Kbps, 23.976 fps, 768x432 (16:9), V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC x264 core 67\nAudio : 112 MB, 192 Kbps, 48000 Hz, 1 channel, 0x55 = AC3, CBR\n\n\nSubtitles (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese in SUB/IDX format a movie, to play them choose Subtitle=&gt;Sub Track in VLC Player and separate English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Polish, Greek, Swedish, Turkish, Dutch, Czech, Serbian), posters and screenshots included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b831fa8b426c6eb2e240182392a31b3bae6fdb7","amp;dn":"Dracula+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b831fa8b426c6eb2e240182392a31b3bae6fdb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,131,31,168,180,38,198,235,46,36,1,130,57,42,49,179,186,230,253,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
