It was released by Paramount Pictures and is the sixth of the seven Road to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ movies. It was the only such movie filmed in color and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day.\n\n***NOTE*** - Wikipedia notes that issues regarding copyright conflicts and idiotic studio descisions regarding film storage and treatment have left the final 3 films in this series in less-than-perfect condition. Unlike the first four, this DVD did not provide a high quality print, subtitles, or even the original trailer. Still, it is the best AVI rip currently available of the film. The commercial DVD is no better. Here's hoping someday someone releases a superior commercial copy. \n\nCast\n\nBing Crosby as George Cochran\nBob Hope as Harold Gridley\nDorothy Lamour as Princess Lalah McTavish\nMurvyn Vye as Prince Ken Arok\nPeter Coe as Gung\nRalph Moody as Bhoma Da\nLeon Askin as King Ramayana\n\nCameos\nAmong the celebrities who made token &quot;gag&quot; appearances in this film are bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing's brother), Humphrey Bogart, by way of a clip from The African Queen, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Jane Russell, as her character from the 1952 film Son of Paleface. The cameo by Martin and Lewis were part of a 'comedy trade' where they made an appearance in this movie, while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis's Scared Stiff the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time.\n\nPlot\n\nGeorge and Harold, American song-and dance-men performing in Melbourne, Australia, have to leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as pearl divers for a prince.\n\nThey are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, (the location is unclear, but possibly in the Maluku Islands). They vie with each other for the favours of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lalah, a cousin of the Prince. The hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the prince plans to claim as his own.\n\nAfter escaping from the prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up another island. Lalah is now in love with both of the boys and can't decide which to chose. Following further romantic complications, the boys participate in a traditional marriage ceremony, both thinking they're marrying Lalah. In fact, she's being unwillingly married to the already much-married King.\n\nHarold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute and thinks that he's going to get her. But she chooses otherwise and George walks off with both Jane and Lala. Harold is left alone on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eecbb2070e5b490d1bd9a6e1bae25a4460cbd6a","amp;dn":"1952+-+Road+to+Bali+-+Bob+Hope%2C+Bing+Crosby%2C+Dorothy+Lamour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eecbb2070e5b490d1bd9a6e1bae25a4460cbd6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,236,187,32,112,229,180,144,209,189,154,110,27,174,37,164,70,12,189,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
