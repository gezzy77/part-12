I had the fortune to grow with my people's music, to listen along, and later on - to sing hora myself, to identify with it and never abandon it, despite some people used to laugh when hearing it's strange, harsh and old melodic lines. Promoting this music became the central pillar of my life. My great-grandmother Dochia from Stoiceni used to sing hora, and also my mother, Nastasia PavÃ„Æ’l from FÃƒÂ®naÃ…Â£e&quot; - Grigore LeÃ…Å¸e, PhD. \n\nRipped from original CDs, FLAC level 8, but the tracks are usually short and the instrumentation is either light or absent, so they don't need that much space. \nEnjoy!
