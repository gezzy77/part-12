She fell into his arms (literally) at a karaoke bar, and a year later KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an insta-family, complete with three stepchildren and two ex-wives. Diane is ex-wife number one, an intense, over-achieving doctor and the mother of twin teenagers Hillary and Warren. Diane is quick to convey her withering disapproval of KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s barely tapped maternal instinct. Ex-wife number two, Jackie, is mother to adopted son Bert, and can pull PeteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strings with her special blend of neurotic, new-ageyness. Juggling all this baggage is uncharted territory for Kate, who finds support with her best friend Meg, a party-hearty singleton and the only woman Kate knows who has less experience with kids than she has.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f54e5f9c7ee34c68ccbe1c9a128477d29ef083d","amp;dn":"Trophy.Wife.S01E06.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f54e5f9c7ee34c68ccbe1c9a128477d29ef083d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,84,229,249,199,238,52,198,140,203,225,201,161,40,71,125,41,239,8,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
