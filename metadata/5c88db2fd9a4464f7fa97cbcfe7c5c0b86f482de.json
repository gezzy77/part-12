And just when they've finally planned a trip together, Grandma Sylvia is suddenly gone, taking Nora's dreams with her.\n\nNora is crushed. She misses her grandmother terribly, but she still wants to see the city they both loved. So when Nora finds letters and a Paris treasure map among her Grandma Sylvia's things, she dares to dream again . . .\n\nShe's not sure what her grandma wants her to find, but Nora knows there are wonderful surprises waiting for her in Paris.
