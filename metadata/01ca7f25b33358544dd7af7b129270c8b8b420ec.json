When his brother dies, scheming Arthur Blake (George Sanders) kidnaps his own nephew, Benjamin (played as a youth by Roddy McDowall and as an adult by Tyrone Power). Arthur&amp;#039;s purpose is to claim his brother&amp;#039;s dukedom for himself. Put to work as a stable boy, Benjamin grows up and develops a crush on his own cousin Isabel (Frances Farmer). When Arthur discovers this, he mercilessly beats Benjamin, who runs away and sails to India on a cargo ship to make his fortune. In Polynesia, he and a friend, Caleb (John Carradine), jump ship and set up camp on a tropical island paradise. There, Benjamin and Caleb become rich mining pearls, while Benjamin falls in love with a native girl, Eve (Gene Tierney). Now that he has amassed wealth, however, Benjamin is determined to return to England and get his revenge on Uncle Arthur.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035360/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035360/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-25044&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-25044&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nJohn Cromwell\n\n\n\tTyrone Power\t... \tBenjamin Blake\n\n\tGene Tierney\t... \tEve\n\tGeorge Sanders\t... \tSir Arthur Blake\n\n\tFrances Farmer\t... \tIsabel Blake\n\n\tElsa Lanchester\t... \tBristol Isabel\n\nSon Of Fury (1942) Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, George Sanders ( English-Spanish).avi\nFile Size : 791 Mb.\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:24\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 480x352\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 924 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,23 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01ca7f25b33358544dd7af7b129270c8b8b420ec","amp;dn":"Son+Of+Fury+%281942%29+Tyrone+Power%2C+Gene+Tierney%2C+George+Sanders+%28+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01ca7f25b33358544dd7af7b129270c8b8b420ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,202,127,37,179,51,88,84,77,215,175,123,18,146,112,200,184,180,32,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
