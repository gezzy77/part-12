Out of print and never released online, the only remaining copies are VHS tapes floating around school libraries or in the homes of fans who dubbed the original shows when they aired.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a whirlwind tour of computing before the Web, with brilliant archival footage and interviews with key players--several of whom passed away since the filming. Jointly produced by WGBH Boston and the BBC, it originally aired in the UK as The Dream Machine before its U.S. premiere in January 1992. Its broadcast was accompanied by a book co-written by the documentary&amp;#039;s producer Jon Palfreman.\n\nWith the help of Simon Willison, Jesse Legg, and (unofficially) the Portland State University library, we&amp;#039;ve tracked down and digitized all five parts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e39196353e6fee01027e1f7dac6aaf950cdce2","amp;dn":"The+Machine+That+Changed+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e39196353e6fee01027e1f7dac6aaf950cdce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,227,145,150,53,62,111,238,1,2,126,31,125,172,106,175,149,12,220,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
