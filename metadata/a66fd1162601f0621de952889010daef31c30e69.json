If you have not, maybe the only way to improve your calculation is to upgrade your processor. But if you are human, then this book will offer you practical advice and an effective training plan to think differently and make decisions far more efficiently.\n\nIn Calculation thinking methods such as Candidates, Combinations, Prophylaxis, Comparison, Elimination, Intermediate Moves, Imagination and Traps are explained to the reader, and ownership of them is offered through a carefully selected series of exercises.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is no shortcut to the grandmaster title, but there is a well-known route that many people have walked over the years. Jacob offers to guide you on part of this journey and I hope you will take him up on the offer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nFrom the foreword by Boris Gelfand\n\nGrandmaster Jacob Aagaard won the British Championship at his first and only attempt. He has received the Guardian, ECF and ChessCafe Book of the Year awards and the FIDE Senior Trainer title. His training material is used by amateurs and grandmasters alike.\n\nThe Grandmaster Preparation series is aimed at ambitious players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66fd1162601f0621de952889010daef31c30e69","amp;dn":"Calculation+%28Grandmaster+Preparation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66fd1162601f0621de952889010daef31c30e69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,111,209,22,38,1,240,98,29,233,82,136,144,16,218,239,49,195,14,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
