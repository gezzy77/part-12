While he still plays all the instruments himself, he plays more of them. Several of the songs mimic the melody mastery of pop bands from 1960s. The most alluring numbers, however, are still his quietly melancholy acoustic ones. While the full-band songs are catchy and smart, Smith's recording equipment isn't quite up to the standards set by the Beatles and the Beach Boys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7c11b062280e607b029ab93d61dfb4eefb19bd","amp;dn":"Elliott+Smith+-+Either%2FOr+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7c11b062280e607b029ab93d61dfb4eefb19bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,124,17,176,98,40,14,96,123,2,154,185,61,97,223,180,238,251,25,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
