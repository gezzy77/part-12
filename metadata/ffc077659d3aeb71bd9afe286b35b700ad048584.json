I think we see it as a body of work that we made during touring. Just a document of different places and moods. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc077659d3aeb71bd9afe286b35b700ad048584","amp;dn":"Keane+-+Night+Train+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc077659d3aeb71bd9afe286b35b700ad048584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,192,119,101,157,58,235,113,189,154,254,40,107,53,183,0,173,4,133,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
