Over a fourteen year period they were the heartbeat on My Girl, Bernadette, I Was Made to Love Her, and every other hit from Motown's Detroit era with artists like THE FOUR TOPS, THE SUPREMES, MARTHA &amp; THE VANDELLAS,  MARVIN GAYE, THE TEMPTATIONS, STEVIE WONDER, SMOKEY ROBINSON &amp; THE MIRACLES and others.\n\nBy the end of their phenomenal run, this unheralded group of musicians had played on more number ones hits than the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Elvis and the Beatles combined - which makes them the greatest hit machine in the history of popular music. They called themselves the Funk Brothers.\n\nForty-one years after they played their first note an a Motown record and three decades since they were all together, the Funk Brothers reunited back in Detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable story in STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN.\n\nWith the tumultuous sixties as a backdrop, Motown's unsung heroes take the viewer on a compelling journey in time as they trace the evolution of The Motown Sound from its origins in Detroit to its demise in Los Angeles during the seventies. Through the eyes of the riveting characters who ruled Hitsville's studio by day and the club scene of Detroit by night, we enter a world of unparalleled soul and emotion as the Funk Brothers revisit the sites of their musical roots, triumphs, and eventual heartbreak.\n\nFor more than four decades, from the dance floors of the world, to the Detroit riots of 1967, to the war in Vietnam, the music the Funk Brothers created has played a major role in the cultural fabric of all of our lives. STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN finally puts some faces on that music and introduces these heroic musical figures to the world. \n\nFourteen years in the making, this film is based upon a book of the same title that won the 1989 Rolling Stone / BMl Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN was shot in 35mm film, on location in Detroit and elsewhere. This one hour and forty-eight minute documentary and performance film tells the Funk Brothers' saga through archival footage and still photos, narration, interviews, re-creation scenes, 20 Motown master tracks, and twelve new live performances of Motown classics with the Funk Brothers backing up Chaka Khan, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins, Montell Jordan, Meshell Ndegeocello, Joan Osborne, and Gerald Levert.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEGENDARY MOTOWN HOUSE BAND THE FUNK BROTHERS REUNITE FOR STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN PERFORMING NEW LIVE VERSIONS OF CLASSIC HITS FEATURING TODAY'S SINGERS\n\nThey are Motown's unsung heroes, known as The Funk Brothers, but no one knew their names. More than 40 years after their first note for Motown, the surviving Funk Brothers reunited in Detroit to tell their story and, one last time, play their music.\n\nJoining The Funk Brothers at Detroit's Royal Oak Music Theater in 2000 to reprise eleven classics for the film's concert sequences were contemporary vocalists Ben Harper (Ain't Too Proud To Beg,and I Heard It Through The Grapevine), Joan Osborne ((Love Is Like A) Heat Wave, and What Becomes Of  The Brokenhearted) and Meshell Ndegeocello (Cloud Nine), and R&amp;B greats Chaka Khan (What's Going On and Ain't No Mountain High Enough) with Montell Jordan), Gerald Levert (Reach Out I'll Be There and Shotgun with Tom Scott) and Bootsy Collins (Do You Love Me, and Cool Jerk). Additionally, the Funk Brothers and Meshell Ndegeocello returned to the original Hitsville basement studio to record the Miracles' YouÃƒÂ¢ve Really Got A Hold On Me.\n\nThe reunited Funk Brothers, many of whom hadn't seen each other in 20-plus years, were Joe Hunter and Johnny Griffith on keyboards, Joe Messina and Eddie Willis on guitar, Bob Babbitt on bass, Jack Ashford on percussion and vibraphone, and Pistol Allen (who has recently passed since the filming) and Uriel Jones on drums. They were joined in spirit by those who had passed away: Van Dyke, Jamerson (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee in 2000), guitarist Robert White, percussionist Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown and drummer Benny Benjamin. Backed by horn and string sections, and a posse of backing vocalists, The Funk Brothers once more laid down the groove.\n\nThe film, which includes new interviews and rare archival footage, was inspired by Allan Slutsky's award-winning 1989 book Standing In The Shadows Of Motown: The Life And Music Of Legendary Bassist James Jamerson.  Motown authority Slutsky co-produced and music supervised, and transcribed and arranged the music. Directing was Paul Justman, whose videos were a staple of early MTV and who has since directed documentaries on The Doors, James Brown, The Neville Brothers and, most recently, the music of New Orleans. With Standing In The Shadows Of Motown, The Funk Brothers finally step into the spotlight.\n\nTracks in the movie: Starring The Funk Brothers on all tracks\n\nHeat Wave - Joan Osborne\nYou've Really Got A Hold On Me - Meshell Ndegeocello\nDo You Love Me - Bootsy Collins\nReach Out I'll Be There - Gerald Levert\nAin't Too Proud To Beg - Ben Harper\nShotgun - Gerald Levert featuring Tom Scott\nWhat Becomes Of The Brokenhearted - Joan Osborne\nI Heard It Through The Grapevine - Ben Harper\nCool Jerk - Bootsy Collins\nCloud Nine - Meshell Ndegeocello\nWhat's Going On - Chaka Kahn\nBand Introduction / Ain't No Mountain High Enough - Chaka Kahn &amp; Montell Jordan\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE FUNK BROTHERS\n\nJack Ashford (Vibes and Percussion) \nEddie Willis (Guitar) \nJoe Messina (Guitar) \nBob Babbitt (Bass) \nUriel Jones (Drums) \nRichard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen (Drums) \nJohnny Griffith (Keyboards) \nJoe Hunter (Keyboards) \n\nDECEASED FUNK BROTHERS FEATURED IN THE FILM\n\nEarl Van Dyke (Keyboards) \nJames Jamerson (Bass) \nBenny &quot;Papa Zita&quot; Benjamin (Drums) \nEddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown (Congas) \nRobert White (Guitar \nRichard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen (Drums) \nJohnny Griffith (Keyboards)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE FUNK BROTHERS WINNER OF 2 GRAMMY AWARDS\n\nBest Compilation Soundtrack Album For A Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media.\nStanding In The Shadows OF Motown \n\nBest Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance \nWhat's Going On - Chaka Khan &amp; The Funk Brothers\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-The Funk Brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat.\n-- Scott Von Doviak, FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM\n\n-If anything, the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans.\n-- Jeff Vice, DESERET NEWS, SALT LAKE CITY\n\n-As a belated nod to some neglected all-stars, Standing in the Shadows of Motown is cultural history of the best kind: informative, revealing and richly entertaining.\n-- Dave Tianen, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL\n\n-If you love Motown music, you'll love this documentary.\n-- Jane Stevenson, JAM!
