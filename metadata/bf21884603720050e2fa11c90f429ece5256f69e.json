Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn't until the lush ballad &quot;Linger&quot; became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of &quot;Linger,&quot; the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\n\n\n01.Dreams\n02.Linger\n03.Zombie\n04.Ode To My Family\n05.I Can't Be With You\n06.Salvation\n07.Free To Decide\n08.When You're Gone\n09.Animal Instinct\n10.Promises\n11.Analyse\n\n\n\n\nRespect and thanks to the original uploader hifi2005!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf21884603720050e2fa11c90f429ece5256f69e","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries-20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282005%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf21884603720050e2fa11c90f429ece5256f69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,33,136,70,3,114,0,80,226,250,17,201,15,66,158,206,82,86,246,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
