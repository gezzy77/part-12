(August 3rd 2015): \n\n        This is a small update that fixes an issue with the way windows\n        are activated and receive focus when using the Control+Tab key\n        combination, switchbar, treebar, and other methods for switching\n        windows. This issue was introduced in a recent change to mIRC and\n        we decided it was important enough, and affected enough users, to\n        release a small update to fix it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340fe197bf23adf72a1266ba31ceb5aa9efa2a72","amp;dn":"MIRC+v7+43-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340fe197bf23adf72a1266ba31ceb5aa9efa2a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,15,225,151,191,35,173,247,42,18,102,186,49,206,181,170,158,250,42,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
