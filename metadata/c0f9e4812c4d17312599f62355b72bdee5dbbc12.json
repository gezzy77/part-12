There are answers for what IS there in the tradition, rich allusions to herbs and smokes used in different capacitities, and the more interesting answers and questions are about what there isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t in the tradition, and why.\n\nAnd along the way, the spectrum of an experience of living mystical subculture is explored, and the romantic idealization and redemptive potential of both Psychedelia and Religion are touched and felt deeply, in the context of outstanding communities and individuals who have experienced the glories and the failures of both.\n\nYoseph Leib travels and studies throughout Jerusalem, New York, and Rainbow Country U.S.A, in search of guidance about how Cannabis and psychedelics have and have not been used in both ancient and emerging Hassidic traditions, and what the way we have related to our desires for medicines, gods, and intoxicants can teach us about how we relate to ourselves, our community, and our G-d. The glorious problem of how what we can learn can set us free, in all kinds of ways.\n\n\nWhy was wine sacramentalized in Judaism and Christianity, and not \nmarijuana?  A young Orthodox Jew, touched and inspired by the reefer, \ngoes to Jerusalem to explore the mystery: What happened to Cannabis in \nthe Jewish religion? How could it be that a religious tradition (Torah) \nclaiming to have all guidance for all situations and the smartest, \nrightest way to enjoy all pleasures never had to deal with the oldest \nand safest drugs in human circulation? No way!\n\nThe surprising answers he learns along the way during his seven years \nspent studying about both ancient, classical, modern and Chassidic \nJewish secret history shed light not only on the mystery of drug \nprohibition and counter culture, but also on the whole nature of \nreligion-as-a-drug, and the unacknowledgeable meaning of the G-d \nlanguage in a secular world. It is a rare look at JerusalemÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s \nunderground mystical subculture and the ideas and conflicts struggled \nwith therein, regarding Judaism, Israel, Law, and righteous crime. The \nlegacy of the hippies vs. the great war for control, and the tragic \nnature of the sacred lie that lets us stay religious in the face of an \never more diverse and cynically demanding visible reality.  Lives and \nsouls are changed, and bodies healed and restored to life, as questions \nare wrestled with: Is it self-indulgence, or is it medicine? When, and \nhow? Can I make my religion, my narcotic helpful, or am I just \nendlessly justifying a useless sacred lie?\n\nWritten over a four year period, back and forth between Israel, \nBrooklyn, and California, it features encounters and testaments from \nthe most important theologians, sages, and scholars I could find, \nsecular as well as religious, secret as well as revealed. It is a \nnarrative exploration that tries to explore and explain the radical and \nconservative nature and diversity of the Chassidic revolution in \nJudaism, as a paradigm for dealing with the wonderful addictions to \nmysticisms, dogmas, and other drugs that keep recurring in every \nover-civilized religion. There is a reason why religions developed as \nthey did, as monstrous tools of vulgar, often context-lacking dogmatic \nrule, despite every successful heresy that tries to restore focus to \nsome truer purpose, some righter priority, before collapsing back into \nblanket industrial instructions for memorizing and Obeying.  And there \nis something of the secret nature of Christianity, Islam, and American \nlaw built into the heart of Judaism, into the way we got into this \ncivilized mess; something that starts with the end of nature and the \naspiration towards Life Eternal, without Fear.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f9e4812c4d17312599f62355b72bdee5dbbc12","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Chassidis%3A+The+Secret+Hebrew+Cannabis+history%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f9e4812c4d17312599f62355b72bdee5dbbc12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,249,228,129,44,77,23,49,37,153,246,35,85,183,43,222,229,219,188,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
