After a successful, yet \nunsanctioned, trial on a newly deceased animal, the team is ready to \nunveil their breakthrough to the world. When the dean of their university \nlearns of their underground experiments, their project is unexpectedly \nshut down and their materials confiscated. Frank, Zoe and their team \n(Donald Glover, Sarah Bolger and Evan Peters) take matters into their own \nhands, launching a rogue attempt to recreate their experiment, during \nwhich things go terribly wrong and one of their own, Zoe, is horrifically \nkilled. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank pushes them to do the unthinkable \nattempt to resurrect their first human test subject. Initially, the \nprocedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong \nwith Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team quickly \nbecomes stuck in a gruesome reality. They are no longer faced with the \nquestion of whether they can bring someone back to life, but rather, the \nwrath of her return.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Olivia Wilde.\n=&gt;-Mark Duplass.\n=&gt;-Evan Peters.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-David Gelb.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2015.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.40 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 417 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 23 mn.\n=&gt;-The Lazarus Effect 2015....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2918436/\n=&gt;-The Lazarus Effect 2015....: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lazarus_effect/\n=&gt;-The Lazarus Effect 2015....: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lazarus-effect/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 528.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 300 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 191 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9723f1e2076a32de462864af63f1d7711da99e52","amp;dn":"The+Lazarus+Effect+-+Horror+Sci-Fi+2015+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH246-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9723f1e2076a32de462864af63f1d7711da99e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,35,241,226,7,106,50,222,70,40,100,175,99,241,215,113,29,169,158,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
