McQueen turns in a commendable performance as the (not so) young rebel without a car, who attempts to alert his townsfolk to the threat of the amorphous alien, demonstrating in the process that tearaway teens can still be steadfast, loyal and true when the shit comes down. Despite producer Jack Harris' pooh-poohing of the 'political subtext' theory, rampant Commie-phobia pervades as the ever-redder blob sucks the life-blood out of every sacred American institution, climaxing in a truly marvellous scene in which the enemy within devours an entire diner, over easy, with a side salad and fries to go.\n\nworldsofdarkblue from Toronto 8 January 2006:\nThis movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you. It's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days. \n\nIt had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time. The set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way. All characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them all\n\nIt had a singularly horrifying monster. It's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts.....it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened. The menace grows continually throughout the story. There are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in McQueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not. It even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.\n\nI saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billed with 'I Married A Monster From Outer Space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple more times before it left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 581mb\nDuration.... 01:23:12\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 716\nFrame Height.... 432\nData Rate.... 890kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 81kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df8417af8850c16a2561785a252d0a7a39b1426","amp;dn":"The+Blob+1958+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df8417af8850c16a2561785a252d0a7a39b1426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,248,65,122,248,133,12,22,162,86,23,133,162,82,208,167,163,155,20,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
