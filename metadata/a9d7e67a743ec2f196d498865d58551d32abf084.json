Got your FPL card?\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nKay Thompson (1909â€“1998) was a singer, dancer, vocal arranger, and coach of \r\nmany MGM musicals in the 1940s. The Eloise character grew out of the voice of a \r\nprecocious six-year-old that Miss Thompson put on to amuse her friends. Collaborating \r\nwith Hilary Knight on what was an immediate bestseller, Kay Thompson became a \r\nliterary sensation when Eloise was published in 1955. The book has sold more \r\nthan two million copies to date. Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight created four more \r\nEloise books, Eloise in Paris, Eloise at Christmas, Eloise in Moscow, and Eloise Takes a Bawth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTony Awardâ€“winning Broadway legend Bernadette Peters gives voice to The Plaza \r\nHotel's most iconic resident as she makes her audio debut in The Eloise Collection. \r\n\r\nKay Thompson's beloved Eloise books have never been available on audio...until now. \r\nTo commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first Eloise book, Kay Thompson's estate \r\npersonally chose Bernadette Peters to narrate the very first Eloise audiobooks. Two \r\nNew York City icons unite in The Eloise Collection, four classic Eloise stories: \r\nEloise; Eloise in Paris; Eloise in Moscow; and Eloise at Christmas Time together in one \r\namazing audio compilation. Join Bernadette Peters as she introduces you to the life \r\nand adventures of Eloiseâ€”a one-of-a-kind audio event","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d7e67a743ec2f196d498865d58551d32abf084","amp;dn":"ELOISE+AUDIO+COLLECTION+-+Kay+Thompson.+Read+by+Bernadette+Peter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d7e67a743ec2f196d498865d58551d32abf084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,215,230,122,116,62,194,241,150,212,152,134,93,88,85,29,50,171,240,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
