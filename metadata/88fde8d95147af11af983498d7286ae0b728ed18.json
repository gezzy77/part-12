It's written by an extremely talented Jeremy Shafer, who is a bay area local.  He's even taught origami at Camp Winnarainbow, which I personally went to as a kid.\n\nI'm sorry, but a hair got on the scanner bed (unnoticed until after the job was done), and some of the corners were bent/folded on some of the scans.  When I went back to the original book to re-scan the fucked up pages, I found the book was damaged (waterlogged), preventing from getting a better 2nd scan.  Thank God I've got the book backed up on my computer now ;-)\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fde8d95147af11af983498d7286ae0b728ed18","amp;dn":"Origami+to+Astonish+and+Amuse%2C+by+Jeremy+Shafer.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fde8d95147af11af983498d7286ae0b728ed18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,253,232,217,81,71,175,17,175,152,52,152,215,40,106,224,183,40,237,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
