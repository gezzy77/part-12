This was O'Neill's favorite of the films based on his work, and he watched it often enough to eventually wear out his print. After a night of revelry in the West Indies, the crew of the SS Glencairn return to the tramp steamer and set sail for Baltimore. They're a varied lot, from middle-aged Irishman Driscoll (Thomas Mitchell), to the young Swedish ex-farmer Ole Olsen (John Wayne), to the brooding Lord Jim-like Englishman Smitty (Ian Hunter). After the ship picks up a load of dynamite in Baltimore, the rough seas they encounter become especially nerve-racking to the crew, who are also concerned that Smitty might be a German spy.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Long Voyage Home.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 701 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Overall bit rate : 928 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 849 Kbps\n      Width : 528 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.375\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.175\n      Stream size : 641 MiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 66.1 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 49.9 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 383 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 2 -q 3 -lowpass 18.6 --vbr-new -b 64\n\nIMDB: tt0032728\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6ead0ce3edef2f63bc01f4eacd9337c6e9a9e7a","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+The+Long+Voyage+Home+%5B1940%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6ead0ce3edef2f63bc01f4eacd9337c6e9a9e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,234,208,206,62,222,242,246,59,192,31,78,172,217,51,124,110,154,158,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
