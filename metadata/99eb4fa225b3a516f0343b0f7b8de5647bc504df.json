Producer Keepnews reflected that it &quot;was such a phenomenal success that not only did I do a lot of such recordings afterwards, but I think that virtually all jazz producers felt that it was a good thing to do&quot;. Also unusual for the time was Keepnews' decision to retain Adderley's comments to the crowd. \n\nTracklist\n1.&quot;This Here&quot; (Bobby Timmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:22[8]\n2.&quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; (Cannonball Adderley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:49\n3.&quot;Hi-Fly&quot; (Randy Weston) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:03\n4.&quot;You Got It!&quot; (Cannonball Adderley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n5.&quot;Bohemia After Dark&quot; (Oscar Pettiford) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:01\n6.&quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot; (Thelonious Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:38 \n7.&quot;This Here (alternate take)&quot; (Timmons) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:\n8. &quot;You Got It!
