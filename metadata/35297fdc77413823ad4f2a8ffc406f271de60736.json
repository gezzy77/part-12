Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life is about making such choices. Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.\n\nSecretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.\n\nBy the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.\n\nSecretary ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use Ã¢â‚¬Å“smart powerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing worldÃ¢â‚¬â€one in which America remains the indispensable nation.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35297fdc77413823ad4f2a8ffc406f271de60736","amp;dn":"Hard+Choices+-+A+Memoir+%28Hillary+Rodham+Clinton%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35297fdc77413823ad4f2a8ffc406f271de60736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,41,127,220,119,65,56,35,173,79,42,143,252,64,111,39,29,230,7,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
