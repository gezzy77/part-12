The emphasis from the beginning is on core concepts and the practical application of AutoCAD in architecture, engineering, and design. Equally useful in instructor-led classroom training and in self-study, the book is written with the student in mind by a long-time AutoCAD user and instructor based on what works in the industry and the classroom.\n\n    * Strips away complexities and reduces AutoCAD to easy-to-understand basic concepts.\n    * Explains &quot;why&quot; something is done, not just &quot;how&quot;: the theory behind each concept or command is discussed prior to engaging AutoCAD so the student has a clear idea of what they are attempting to do.\n    * All basic commands are documented step-by-step: what the user types in and how AutoCAD responds is spelled out in discrete and clear steps with numerous screenshots.\n    * Extensive supporting graphics (screenshots) and a summary with a self-test section and topic specific drawing exercises are included at the end of each chapter.\n    * Also available in a 2D+3D version with 10 additional chapters covering 3D concepts. The ISBN for the 2D+3D version is 978-012-387029-2.\n\n\n# Paperback: 550 pages\n# Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (August 11, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123876834\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123876836","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31fe70daa1b7766d89b75eb35df0c3d7ef6f2392","amp;dn":"Up+and+Running+with+AutoCAD+2012+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31fe70daa1b7766d89b75eb35df0c3d7ef6f2392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,254,112,218,161,183,118,109,137,183,94,179,93,240,195,215,239,111,35,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
