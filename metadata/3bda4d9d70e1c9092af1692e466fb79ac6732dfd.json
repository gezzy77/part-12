The album was a relative chart disappoint, reaching the tenth spot in the US, lower than the other four of the band&amp;#039;s first five albums, all of which were monster hits. Like those albums, however, Head Games stayed popular years and even decades after its release, eventually selling over five million copies in the US alone. It is perhaps as famous (or infamous) for its extremely lurid album cover, depicting a young, scantily clad girl in a filthy men&amp;#039;s room, as it is for its music. The title track is probably the album&amp;#039;s best-known song.\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Dirty White Boy&quot; (Gramm, Jones) ? 3:37\n2. &quot;Love on the Telephone&quot; (Gramm, Jones) ? 3:18\n3. &quot;Women&quot; (Jones) ? 3:25\n4. &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Get Even With You&quot; (Jones) ? 3:40\n5. &quot;Seventeen&quot; (Gramm, Jones) ? 4:43\n6. &quot;Head Games&quot; (Gramm, Jones) ? 3:37\n7. &quot;The Modern Day&quot; (Jones) ? 3:26\n8. &quot;Blinded by Science&quot; (Jones) ? 4:54\n9. &quot;Do What You Like&quot; (Gramm, McDonald) ? 3:58\n10. &quot;Rev on the Red Line&quot; (Gramm, Greenwood) ? 3:35\n11. &quot;Zalia&quot; [*] (Gramm, McDonald) ? 2:34\n\n4, also known as Foreigner 4, is the fourth album by American rock band Foreigner, released in 1981. Several singles from the album were successful, including &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot;.\n\nThe album marked the completion of the band&amp;#039;s shift to hard rock, begun in Head Games. Half of the original lineup - Ian McDonald, Al Greenwood, and Ed Gagliardi - had left before the recording of 4. As a result, all of the songs on the album are compositions by Mick Jones and/or Lou Gramm. McDonald and Greenwood had played saxophone and keyboards, respectively, and so several session musicians were needed to replace their contributions, among them Junior Walker, whose sax solo in the bridge of &quot;Urgent&quot; is a high point of the album, and a young Thomas Dolby, who would later have a successful solo career.\nrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Lou Gramm and Mick Jones, except where noted.\n\n1. &quot;Night Life&quot; ? 3:11\n2. &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; ? 4:29\n3. &quot;Break It Up&quot; (Jones) ? 3:48\n4. &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; ? 4:11\n5. &quot;Luanne&quot; ? 3:48\n6. &quot;Urgent&quot; (Jones) ? 4:51\n7. &quot;I&amp;#039;m Gonna Win&quot; (Jones) ? 4:18\n8. &quot;Woman in Black&quot; (Jones) ? 4:42\n9. &quot;Girl on the Moon&quot; ? 3:49\n10. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Let Go&quot; ? 4:49\n11. &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; [nearly unplugged version]* ? 3:06\n12. &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; [nearly unplugged version]* ? 2:50\n\nAgent Provocateur is the fifth album by American/British rock band Foreigner, released in 1984. A concept album, the songs tell the story of a spy who sees life through both the inside and the outside. Although album sales were lower than their previous work, the album contains the band&amp;#039;s biggest hit single, the album&amp;#039;s love theme, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;.
