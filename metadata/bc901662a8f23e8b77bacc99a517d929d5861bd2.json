People live in half-deserted apartment buildings, and \nkeep electric animals as pets because so many real animals have died. Most people emigrate to Mars - unless \nthey have a job to do on Earth. Like Rick Deckard - android killer for the police and owner of an electric \nsheep. This week he has to find, identify, and kill six androids which have escaped from Mars. They're \nmachines, but they look and sound and think like humans - clever, dangerous humans. They will be hard to kill. \nThe film Blade Runner was based on this famous novel.\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\n&quot;The most consistently brilliant science fiction writer in the world.&quot;\n--John Brunner\nTHE INSPIRATION FOR BLADERUNNER. . .\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was published in 1968. Grim and foreboding, even today it is a masterpiece \nahead of its time.\nBy 2021, the World War had killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind \noff-planet. Those who remained coveted any living creature, and for people who couldn't afford one, companies \nbuilt incredibly realistic simulacrae: horses, birds, cats, sheep. . .\nThey even built humans. Emigrees to Mars received androids so sophisticated it was impossible to tell them \nfrom true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans could wreak, the government banned them f\nrom Earth. But when androids didn't want to be identified, they just blended in.\nRick Deckard was an officially sanctioned bounty hunter whose job was to find rogue androids, and to retire \nthem. But cornered, androids tended to fight back, with deadly results.\n&quot;[Dick] sees all the sparkling and terrifying possibilities. . . that other authors shy away from.&quot;\n--Paul Williams\n\n\n\nIt was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill.\n\nSomewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue \nandroids. Deckard's assignment--find them and then...&quot;retire&quot; them. \nTrouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't \nwant to be found!\n\nThe classic novel behind the cult film classic directed by Ridley Scott. \nAs atmospheric and even more compelling than the film. A dystopian tour \nde force.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc901662a8f23e8b77bacc99a517d929d5861bd2","amp;dn":"Philip+K+Dick+-+Do+Androids+Dream+of+Electric+Sheep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc901662a8f23e8b77bacc99a517d929d5861bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,144,22,98,168,242,62,139,119,186,204,153,165,23,217,41,213,134,27,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
