The author describes the biological evolution of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organisms, and reconstructs their adaptations to the life they led, and the ecology and environment in which they functioned. On the grand scale, Earth is a constantly changing planet, continually presenting organisms with challenges. Changing geography, climate, atmosphere, oceanic and land environments set a stage in which organisms interact with their environments and one another, with evolutionary change an inevitable result. The organisms themselves in turn can change global environments: oxygen in our atmosphere is all produced by photosynthesis, for example. The interplay between a changing Earth and its evolving organisms is the underlying theme of the book.\n\n\nMy Blog: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c138a4ae0d4ab93725f8ba07fa8792391c8847","amp;dn":"History+of+Life+5th+Edition+%28PDF%29+-+April+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c138a4ae0d4ab93725f8ba07fa8792391c8847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,193,56,164,174,13,74,185,55,37,248,186,7,250,135,146,57,28,136,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
