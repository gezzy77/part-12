The album features the five hit singles, of which four were UK top 10 singles, the title track &quot;Nu Flow&quot; which was a hit all over Europe, &quot;OK&quot;, &quot;Favourite Things&quot; (the highest charting hit from the album) and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;. The fifth single from the album was &quot;Ain't What You Do&quot;, which peaked at #15. The album peaked at #6 in the UK albums chart and has been certified double platinum.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Caroline Butler - When Big Brovaz stormed into the charts with the title track from their slick, radio-friendly debut, Nu Flow they were hailed as the UK's answer to their equally polished and funky &quot;dirty south&quot; counterparts. Except, as some confused critics pointed out, surely these guys (and girls) are a little more Atlanta than Lewisham? With one of the key members (J Rock) originating from the other side of the pond, perhaps it's not too surprising that there's a distinctly mid-Atlantic flavour to much of Nu Flow, and, after all, the majority of tracks here emulate the kind of R&amp;B pop that dominates the US charts. Sure, there's nothing wrong with that--if you've got the skills and the songs to pull it off, that is. Sadly, Big Brovaz do not. Just watch those Outkast comparisons fade away with tracks such as the cringe-inducing ballad to single motherhood &quot;Little Mama&quot;, complete with a distinct Ali G rapping style. And just check out some of the lyrics to &quot;Baby Boy&quot; (&quot;keep doing what you do / I feel your whole aura&quot;). There are some tracks that show promise, &quot;Summertime&quot; stands out with its funky Latin laced samples and &quot;Gotta Get&quot; has a great chorus that proves Big Brovaz deserve at least one more slot in the charts. Unfortunately, though, nothing on Nu Flow ever lives up to the promise of its title track.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Nu-Flow\n[02] Gotta Get\n[03] Don't Matter\n[04] Baby Boy\n[05] Ain't What You Do\n[06] OK [Radio Edit]\n[07] I Know You're There\n[08] Taking It Global\n[09] Summertime\n[10] Find A Way\n[11] Little Mamma\n[12] This Music\n[13] Don't Watch That\n[14] OK (Rock Remix)\n \t\n\nMusic Videos \n\n[01] Nu-Flow\n[02] Ok\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:53m:17s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 176mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers, File &amp; Videos)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Quicktime \n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Hip Hop R&amp;B\n\nRelease Date\t&gt; 04 November 2002\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Riot Records Sony Music\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n[url]http://www.bigbrovaz.com[/url]\n[url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brovaz[/url]\n[url]http://www.azlyrics.com/b/bigbrovaz.html[/url]\n[url]http://www.muzu.tv/bigbrovaz[/url]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79808f7dddaeea48c599ed611558b245584fcee0","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Nu-Flow+-+Big+Brovaz+-+176mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79808f7dddaeea48c599ed611558b245584fcee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,128,143,125,221,174,234,72,197,153,237,97,21,88,178,69,88,79,206,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
