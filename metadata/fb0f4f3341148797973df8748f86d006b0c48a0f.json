Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty faÃƒÂ§ade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils...Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n \n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0f4f3341148797973df8748f86d006b0c48a0f","amp;dn":"The+Casual+Vacancy+by+J.+K.+Rowling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0f4f3341148797973df8748f86d006b0c48a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,15,79,51,65,20,135,151,151,61,248,116,143,134,208,6,176,196,138,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
