Described in vibrant detail by eminent musicologist Harvey Sachs, this symbol of freedom and joy was so unorthodox that it amazed and confused listeners at its unveilingÃ¢â‚¬â€yet it became a standard for subsequent generations of creative artists, and its composer came to embody the Romantic cult of genius. In this unconventional, provocative book, BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterwork becomes a prism through which we may view the politics, aesthetics, and overall climate of the era. Part biography, part history, part memoir, The Ninth brilliantly explores the intricacies of BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last symphonyÃ¢â‚¬â€how it brought forth the power of the individual while celebrating the collective spirit of humanity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664f1105deeb34bc8ceea4b5e8638a021b137fd7","amp;dn":"The+Ninth%3A+Beethoven+and+the+World+in+1824","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664f1105deeb34bc8ceea4b5e8638a021b137fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,79,17,5,222,235,52,188,140,238,164,181,232,99,138,2,27,19,127,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
