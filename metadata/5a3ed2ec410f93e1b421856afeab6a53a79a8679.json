He sees hatred and destruction wrought by every kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ there is, and the zealots who kill in their names. Until now, he has always been a part of the solutionÃ¢â‚¬â€however imperfectÃ¢â‚¬â€a part of justice. But when Gil discovers he played a key role in wrongly condemning an innocent man to death row, it shakes his faithÃ¢â‚¬â€in the system, in himself, and in GodÃ¢â‚¬â€deeply. It even estranges him from his wife and son. \n\nDesperate, Gil offers up a prayer. To know God is there, not through a sign or physical demonstration but through the strength to cope with his ever-growing, ever-creeping doubts. \n\nHis problems become more than personal as things heat up in Houston. A serial killer terrorizing the morally righteous turns out to have religious motivations, upping the case from homicide to domestic terrorism. A number of prominent secular icons die or are grievously injured abruptly and under suspicious circumstances, the latest of which is a New Atheist writer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen into an inexplicable coma. Left and right, it seems Gil canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape the power of God and murder. \n\nAs Gil investigates both cases, he realizes that there may be a connectionÃ¢â‚¬â€answering his prayers in a most terrifying way. \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
