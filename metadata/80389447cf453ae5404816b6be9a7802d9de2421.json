Many of the compositions are based on simple blues progressions, but the sense of cool swing and bop pyrotechnics from Ellis and Peterson approximates the magic the two leaders shared together in the &amp;#039;50s (when Ellis was the regular guitarist for Peterson&amp;#039;s then-bassless trio). Though HELLO HERBIE is not an essential addition to the Peterson catalogue, the scads of fine playing here will surely please fans of either musician.\n\nPersonnel:\nOscar Peterson (piano)\nHerb Ellis (guitar)\nSam Jones (bass instrument)\nBob Durham (drums)\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Naptown Blues\n2.Exactly Like You\n3.Day By Day\n4.Hamp&amp;#039;s Blues\n5.Blues For HG\n6.Seven Come Eleven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80389447cf453ae5404816b6be9a7802d9de2421","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+-+Hello+Herbie+%281969%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80389447cf453ae5404816b6be9a7802d9de2421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,56,148,71,207,69,58,229,64,72,22,182,190,154,120,2,217,222,36,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
