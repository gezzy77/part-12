Always interested in blending jazz with folk and pop, the guitarist does just that, focusing heavily on the folk end of things on One Quiet Night. Featuring a nice afterglow interpretation of Norah Jones\\' hit \\&quot;Don\\'t Know Why\\&quot; and an unexpected reinterpretation of \\&quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey\\&quot; which turns the Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers classic into a poignant lament, the album also showcases Metheny as a melodic pop composer. \\&quot;Song for the Boys\\&quot; sounds surprisingly like an instrumental take on early-\\'80s British pop ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la the Smiths, while \\&quot;Last Train Home\\&quot; brilliantly mixes Metheny\\'s knack for taking simple chord progressions and beautifully tweaking them with odd harmonies. Perhaps a bit light for some straight-ahead jazz fans, listeners interested in thoughtful, folky, jazz-inflected ballads will find this rapturous.\n\n01. One Quiet Night \n02. Song For The Boys \n03.
