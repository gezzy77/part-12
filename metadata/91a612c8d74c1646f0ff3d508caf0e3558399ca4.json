Tell the wrong joke in Singapore or United Arab Emirates and risk being handcuffed before you ever leave the stage. Bring Achmed the Dead Terrorist on stage in Malaysia after a government warning forbidding his presence, and you may begin an indefinite vacation in Kuala Lumpur. While Dunham collects and crafts pop culture references that can excite a local audience upon entering each country - Achmed on this trepidation of returning to the Middle East, Walter's (lack of) understanding of current race relations in South Africa, Bubba J. finding kindred spirits in Australia - Jeff shows that humor is truly universal. Most of the time.\n\n-- Better copy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a612c8d74c1646f0ff3d508caf0e3558399ca4","amp;dn":"Jeff+Dunham%3A+All+Over+the+Map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a612c8d74c1646f0ff3d508caf0e3558399ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,166,18,200,215,76,22,70,240,255,61,80,140,175,14,53,88,57,156,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
