In a widely acclaimed performance, Finney plays a brilliant but stern classics instructor at a posh prep school who is forced out of his job and into the realization that he is despised in the classroom... and at home. Suddenly the proud academic is cast adrift ... until one student\\\\\\&amp;#039;s profound act of kindness gives him the inspiration and courage to build his life anew.\n\nIMDB --\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0109340/\n\nIMDB description:\nAndrew Crocker-Harris is an embittered and disliked teacher of Greek and Latin at a British prep school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. The boys regard him as a Hitler, with some justification. His wife Laura is unfaithful, and lives to wound him any way she can. Andrew must come to terms with his failed life and regain at least his own self-respect.
