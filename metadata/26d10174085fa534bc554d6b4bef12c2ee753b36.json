Masako's own search for a way out of the straitjacket of a dead-end life leads her, too, to take drastic action.\r\n\r\nThe complex yet riveting narrative seamlessly combines a convincing glimpse into the grimy world of Japan's yakuza with a brilliant portrayal of the psychology of a violent crime and the ensuing game of cat-and-mouse between seasoned detectives and a group of determined but inexperienced criminals. Kirino has mastered a Thelma and Louise kind of graveyard humor than illuminators her stunning evocation of the pressures and prejudices that drive women to extreme deeds and the friendship that bolsters them in the aftermath. \r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d10174085fa534bc554d6b4bef12c2ee753b36","amp;dn":"Natsuo+Kirino+-+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d10174085fa534bc554d6b4bef12c2ee753b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,209,1,116,8,95,165,52,188,85,77,107,75,239,18,194,238,117,59,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
