It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers, featuring slapstick comedy and gross-out humor. Dumb and Dumber contributed to the launch of a successful career for them and set the foundation for many Farrelly Brothers movies to come. It has a devoted cult following.\n\nA prequel, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, which contained none of the original film's cast, was released in 2003 to poor critical reception, but a mild box office success. \n\n\n\n\n\nDumb and Dumber 1994\n\n\nDumb and Dumber: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the original soundtrack to the film.\n\nThe song &quot;The Rain, The Park, and Other Things&quot; by The Cowsills was not in the soundtrack, although it was played quite prominently in the montage of Lloyd fantasizing about Mary, nor was &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; by Roy Orbison, though it was featured prominently in the make-over montage.\n\nAlso missing are &quot;Rollin Down the Hill&quot; by The Rembrandts, Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm&quot; by the Crash Test Dummies, &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, &quot;Can We Still Be Friends&quot; by Todd Rundgren (who also wrote the original soundtrack), &quot;Boom Shack-a-lak&quot; by Apache Indian and &quot;Make Love Now&quot; by Patrick Wilson.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot; by Crash Test Dummies (featuring Ellen Reid)\n2.\t&quot;New Age Girl (Mary Moon)&quot; by Deadeye Dick\n3.\t&quot;Insomniac&quot; by Echobelly\n4.\t&quot;If You Don't Love Me (I'll Kill Myself)&quot; by Pete Droge\n5.\t&quot;Crash (The '95 Mix)&quot; by The Primitives\n6.\t&quot;Whiney, Whiney (What Really Drives Me Crazy)&quot; by Willi One Blood\n7.\t&quot;Too Much of a Good Thing&quot; by The Sons featuring Bret Reilly\n8.\t&quot;You Sexy Thing&quot; by Deee-Lite\n9.\t&quot;Where I Find My Heaven&quot; by Gigolo Aunts\n10.\t&quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; by Butthole Surfers\n11.\t&quot;Take&quot; by The Lupins\n12.\t&quot;The Bear Song&quot; by Green JellÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿\n13.\t&quot;Get Ready&quot; by The Proclaimers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec4b079d9fdc6d26cf476e071f049e5bf249f3d","amp;dn":"Dumb+and+Dumber+1994+%28Soundtrack%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec4b079d9fdc6d26cf476e071f049e5bf249f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,196,176,121,217,253,198,210,108,244,118,224,113,240,73,229,191,36,159,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
