Old Bailey, the main courthouse in London, had never presented a show quite like the trial that captivated England and much of the literary world in the spring of 1895. Celebrity, sex, witty dialogue, political intrigue, surprising twists, and important issues of art and morality--is it any surprise that the trials of Oscar Wilde continue to fascinate one hundred years after the death of one of the world's greatest authors and playwrights?\n\nThe Trials of Oscar Wilde - Part I:\n'Between the Bark and The Tree'\nBy Christopher Fitz-Simon (89 mins)\n\nDirected by Peter Kavanagh\n\n\nOscar Wilde and His Longtime Companion Lord Alfred Douglas\n\nThe Cast\nNathaniel Parker........

Inmates followed a regimen of &quot;hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed&quot;, which wore very harshly on Wilde, accustomed as he was to many creature comforts. His health declined sharply, and in November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right ear drum was ruptured in the fall, an injury that would later contribute to his death. He spent two months in the infirmary.\n\n-----------------------File Information-------------------------\nMPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 160 kbps mp3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 44 khz - Stereo, CRC\nTotal Duration: 148 Mins\nWebrip\nSource: Re-upload of SeymourDAC dead seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501e609b625a805687f22fc92c10b6a21a20af44","amp;dn":"The+Trials+of+Oscar+Wilde+++%28BBC+1996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501e609b625a805687f22fc92c10b6a21a20af44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,30,96,155,98,90,128,86,135,242,47,201,44,16,182,162,26,32,175,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
