Thanks to all the release blogs that posted\t||\n||\t\tour caps when the scene or BALLISTIC didn't yet and also||\n||\t\tto the downloaders who didn't complain that the quality\t||\n||\t\tis lower than normal due to the fact that it's capped\t||\n||\t\tfrom an SD channel and not HD. We love you guys&lt;3\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tI'd say congrats to whoever hit the motherlode but I'm\t||\n||\t\tonly halfway through season 3 so I didn't watch this\t||\n||\t\tyet. :P\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tSee you next season, maybe! (there will be a season 4!)\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tIncluded in this release of Gold Rush Live is everything||\n||\t\tfrom the actual show to the live and non-live segments.\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tAnd once again it's not overcropped...letterboxed on SD\t||\n||\t\tand as a result part of the &quot;LIVE&quot; thing at the top was\t||\n||\t\tnot on the actual show (just black) so we cropped it\t||\n||\t\tout. The only thing actually cropped out are a few \t||\n||\t\ttweets that appeared in a ticker under the actual show.\t||\n||\t\tUnimportant and doesn't change what you're watching.\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tStill reading? Hah. Since you're actually reading this\t||\n||\t\tI might as well say sorry that it's late. Usually we up\t||\n||\t\tGold Rush within 10 minutes of it airing but towards\t||\n||\t\tthe end it was noticed cropping was done wrong by a few\t||\n||\t\tpixels and when the new encode finished\twe accidentally\t||\n||\t\tdeleted it which led to 20 long minutes of waiting...\t||\n||\t\tBut we did it right finally. Cropping is correct and\t||\n||\t\twe didn't delete the file. :D\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t||\n||\t\tStill reading? Stop. Seriously.
