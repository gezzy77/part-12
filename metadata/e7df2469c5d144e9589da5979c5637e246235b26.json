In Adventures Beyond the Body, William Buhlman recounts his fascinating experiences with astral travel, connects this phenomenon with current cosmological theories, and suggests that we all have the capability to travel to parallel universes. Don&amp;#039;t worry about getting lost--Adventures is filled with well mapped methods for finding your way out of your body and into other worlds. Control is Buhlman&amp;#039;s mantra, specifically control over our fear of the unknown. He precisely addresses the common events that can occur during an out-of-body experience, taking the fear out of the journey, and allowing you to focus on living the adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7df2469c5d144e9589da5979c5637e246235b26","amp;dn":"Adventures+Beyond+The+Body","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7df2469c5d144e9589da5979c5637e246235b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,223,36,105,197,209,68,233,88,157,165,151,156,86,55,226,70,35,91,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
