When observed from the outside, these phenomena are often written off as being just â€œcrazy,â€ but what if they were actually planned and logical?\r\n\r\nNeuroLogic explores the brainâ€™s internal system of reasoning, from its unconscious depths to conscious decision making, and illuminates how it explains our most outlandish as well as our most stereotyped behaviors. From sleepwalking murderers, contagious yawning, and the brains of sports fans to false memories, subliminal messages, and the secret of ticklishness, Dr. Eliezer Sternberg shows that there are patterns to the way the brain interprets the worldâ€”â€“patterns that fit the brainâ€™s unique logic. Unraveling these patterns and the various ways they can be disturbed will not only alter our view of mental illness and supernatural experience, but will also shed light on the hidden parts of ourselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dcc294304e682600672e89ca257c190ffc3b1db","amp;dn":"NeuroLogic%3A+The+Brain%27s+Hidden+Rationale+Behind+Our+Irrational","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dcc294304e682600672e89ca257c190ffc3b1db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,204,41,67,4,230,130,96,6,114,232,156,162,87,193,144,255,195,177,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
