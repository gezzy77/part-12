Drawing is especially valuable because it improves hand-eye coordination, as well as your understanding of form and shape. It also lets you quickly communicate ideas that may be difficult to put into words. To help you hone your skills, Von Glitschka has developed the 21-Day Drawing Challenge. The goal isn't to turn you into a professional illustrator or fine artistÃ¢â‚¬â€it's about improving your drawing skills and creative thinking, no matter if you're an expert or have never drawn more than a doodle on a notepad. \n\nA new drawing challenge will be posted each business day, starting on August 4 and ending on August 29. This way if you miss a day, you'll have the weekend to catch up. Take the time you need to finish each challenge. The following day, we'll post a video where Von shares his own hand-drawn solution to the previous day's challenge. There are no right answers here; his solutions should serve as inspiration! On the final day of the course we'll post the last two challenges and a chapter of inspiring drawers to help keep you motivated. Each movie will profile a different artist, including people like Kate Bingaman Burt and Mattias Adolfsson. So, step up to the plate. You're just 21 days from a new creative habit. And don't forget to share your drawings via Twitter and Facebook! Use the hashtag #draw21days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778d11cf63560bcbc68d787347781f570b0a5688","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+21-Day+Drawing+Challenge+with+Von+Glitschka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778d11cf63560bcbc68d787347781f570b0a5688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,141,17,207,99,86,11,203,198,141,120,115,71,120,31,87,11,10,86,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
