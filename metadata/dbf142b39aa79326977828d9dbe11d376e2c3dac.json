In 2003, the album was ranked number 53 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Soul&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Soul&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic Records: 1953ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1959\n\nAlmost immediately after signing with Atlantic, Charles scored his first hit single. &quot;Mess Around&quot; was an R&amp;B hit in 1953. &quot;It Should Have Been Me&quot; and &quot;Don't You Know&quot; both made the charts in 1954, but &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; (composed with band mate Renald Richard) brought him to national prominence.\n\nThe song reached the top of Billboard's R&amp;B singles chart in 1955 and from there until 1959 he would have a series of R&amp;B successes including &quot;A Fool For You&quot; (No. 1), &quot;This Little Girl of Mine&quot;, &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot;, &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, &quot;Drown in My Own Tears&quot; (No. 1) and the No. 5 hit &quot;The Night Time (Is the Right Time)&quot;, which were compiled on his Atlantic releases Hallelujah, I Love Her So, Yes Indeed!, and The Genius Sings the Blues.\n\nDuring this time of transition, he recruited a young girl group from Philadelphia, The Cookies, as his background singing group, recording with them in New York and changing their name to the Raelettes in the process.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Charles&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
