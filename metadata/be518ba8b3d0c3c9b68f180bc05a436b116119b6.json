Of these three artists, the Drifters had the most hits out of the starting gate, scoring with &quot;Money Honey,&quot; &quot;Such a Night,&quot; &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Honey Love.&quot; Charles began writing a number of classics, including &quot;The Midnight Hour,&quot; &quot;Mess Around&quot; and &quot;I Got a Woman,&quot; and Baker had hits with &quot;Soul On Fire&quot; and &quot;Tweedle Dee.&quot; All of these songs -- plus excellent sides from the Clovers (&quot;Ting-A-Ling,&quot; &quot;Good Lovin',&quot; &quot;Lovey Dovey&quot;), the Chords (&quot;Sh-Boom&quot;), Tommy Ridgley (&quot;Jam Up&quot;) and the Diamonds (&quot;A Beggar for Your Kisses&quot;) -- are on Vol. 2. These are some of the greatest R&amp;B singles ever recorded, sounding just as vital decades after their original release, and the songs that weren't hits are nearly as good -- sometimes just as good -- as the ones that were.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
