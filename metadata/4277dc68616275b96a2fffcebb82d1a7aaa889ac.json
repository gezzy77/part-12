(10%), and your employer (the remainder), where the same labor that earns the potential to buy your self free from ownership also raises your value and thus increases the cost of your freedom, one man from our pre-Incorporation times is awakened from cryogenic 'sleep'.\n\nThis is a very rich story, with a strong case for the incorporation system and a Steve Jobs-type capitalist who is challenging it. I think of it as the bastard child of Ayn Rand and George Orwell. This future world offers plenty of new intrigues and fantastic technologies, and rarely are they simply mentioned and unexplained to the reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4277dc68616275b96a2fffcebb82d1a7aaa889ac","amp;dn":"The+Unincorporated+Man+%28unabridged+MP3+audiobook%29+-+Kollin+broth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4277dc68616275b96a2fffcebb82d1a7aaa889ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,119,220,104,97,98,117,185,106,47,255,206,187,130,209,167,170,168,137,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
