Recording sessions for the \nalbum took place in June of 1970 and MarchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“May of 1971 at Hitsville U.S.A., \nGolden World and United Sound Studios in Detroit, Michigan and at The Sound \nFactory in West Hollywood, California. The first Marvin Gaye album for it to be \ncredited as produced solely by the artist himself, What's Going On is a unified \nalbum consisting of nine songs, most of which lead into the next. It has also \nbeen categorized as a song cycle, since the album ends on a reprise to the \nalbum's opening theme. The album is told from the point of view of a Vietnam War \nveteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing nothing \nbut injustice, suffering and hatred.\n\nWhat's Going On was the first album on which Motown Records' main studio band, \nthe group of session musicians The Funk Brothers, received an official credit. \nFeaturing introspective lyrics about drug abuse, poverty and the Vietnam War, \nthe album was also the first to reflect the beginning of a new trend in soul \nmusic. What's Going On was both an immediate commercial and critical success and \nhas endured as a classic of early-1970s soul. In worldwide critics/artists and \npublic surveys, it has been voted as one of the landmark recordings in pop music \nhistory and is considered to be one of the greatest albums ever made. In 2003, \nthe album was ranked number 6 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 \ngreatest albums of all time.\n\nIn late March of 1970, Marvin Gaye had fallen into a deep depression following \nthe death of his singing partner and fellow Motown artist Tammi Terrell, who \ndied of a brain tumor earlier that month. Gaye refused to record or perform, \ngoing as far as to attempt an athletic career in football with the Detroit Lions \nof the NFL. After an unsuccessful tryout for the team, Gaye came in contact with \nmusician Al Cleveland and the Four Tops' Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson, who were working \non a politically conscious song called &quot;What's Going On&quot;. Gaye assisted \nCleveland and Benson in completing the composition, and planned to produce the \nsong as a recording for the Motown act The Originals. However, Cleveland and \n&quot;Obie&quot; Benson persuaded Gaye to record the song himself. In June of 1970, Gaye \nrecorded &quot;What's Going On&quot; and his own composition, &quot;God Is Love&quot;, which further \nexpanded Gaye's inclusion of his spirituality in his music.\n\nRecording such material was a different direction for Gaye, who had previously \nperformed and recorded radio-formatted and contemporary songs that were more \nrepresentative of the Gordy-produced Motown Sound rather than politically or \nsocially-conscious music. When Gaye delivered the songs as the sides for his \nnext 45 RPM single, Motown Records CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. objected to the material \nand refused to release the recordings. After already permitting another fellow \nMotown artist to record and release material that hinted social and political \nthemes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stevie Wonder who released his 1970 single &quot;Heaven Help Us All&quot; and his \n1971 artistic breakthrough Where I'm Coming From released earlier that year ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \nGordy considered &quot;What's Going On&quot; far too political to be released on radio and \nalso too unfamiliar for the popular music and sound of that time to be \ncommercially successful. Gaye, however, stood his ground and lobbied his case to \nlabel executives and Gordy, as he wanted to be able to express himself \ncreatively, and not by Gordy's or Motown's version of music on his records. In \nan interview for Rolling Stone magazine, Marvin Gaye discused what had shaped \nhis view on more socially concsious themes in music and the conception of his \neleventh studio album:\n\n    In 1969 or 1970, I began to re-evaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my \nmusic to say... I was very much affected by letters my brother was sending me \nfrom Vietnam, as well as the social situation here at home. I realized that I \nhad to put my own fantasies behind me if I wanted to write songs that would \nreach the souls of people. I wanted them to take a look at what was happening in \nthe world.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Marvin Gaye\n\nGordy eventually gave in, certain that the record would flop. &quot;What's Going On&quot; \nbecame Motown's fastest selling single at that point, going to the number-one \nspot on the R&amp;B charts for five weeks and number-two for three weeks on the Pop \nlistings, with &quot;Joy to the World&quot; by Three Dog Night retaining the top spot.\n\nRecording\n\nAfter this success, Berry Gordy requested an entire accompanying album. Gaye \nbegan recording the tracks that would eventually comprise his best-known work, \nthe What's Going On album, handling all of his own production and some of his \nown songwriting. The entire album was originally mixed in Detroit, with Marvin \nGaye out of town and not present. This mix, dubbed &quot;The Detroit Mix&quot;, was \nscrapped and redone. These mixes were later released on the 2001 two-disc deluxe \nedition of What's Going On, along with the original mono 45 mixes of the \nsingles. Also included was a recording of one of Gaye's first live performances \nfrom The Kennedy Center Auditorium, Washington DC, 01-06-1972, after three years \naway from the stage following Tammi Terrell's illness and death.\n\nThe content of What's Going On was that of a politically charged and deeply \npersonal Motown album, and was notable for including elements of jazz and \nclassical music instrumentation and arrangements. The record was among the first \nsoul albums to place heavy emphasis on political and social concerns such as \nenvironmentalism, political corruption, drug abuse, and the Vietnam War, in \nwhich Gaye's brother, Frankie Gaye, had served in for three years of service for \nthe U.S. Army. However, after hearing a preliminary mix of the record, Berry \nGordy was not offended by Gaye's embrace of countercultural politics, but was \nbothered by the album's design, which had each song leading to the next. This \nflow of sound was not conventional and suited for radio airplay, which seemed as \nGordy's main focus; the commercial aspect. The album's stylistic manor of using \na song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and lead What's Going On to become known as \nthe first soul music concept albums.\n\nReception\n\nInitial\n\nThe critical and commercial success of the album was immediate and significant. \nWhat's Going On remained on the Billboard Pop Album Charts for over a year and \nsold over two million copies until the end of 1972, making it Marvin Gaye's \nbest-selling album to that date until he released Let's Get It On in 1973. In \naddition, What's Going On received the highest ratings from several leading \nAmerican publications, including Time, Rolling Stone (who named it &quot;Album of the \nYear&quot;), The New York Times, and Billboard, who gave it the Billboard Trend \nsetter Award of 1971. Upon release, Rolling Stone magazine music critic Vince \nAletti praised What's Going On for its thematic approach towards social and \npolitical concerns, while also mentioning the surprise of Motown releasing such \nan album. In a review of the album and Stevie Wonder's Where I'm Coming From, \nAletti wrote:\n\n    Ambitious, personal albums may be a glut on the market elsewhere, but at \nMotown they're something new... the album as a whole takes precedence, absorbing \nits own flaws. There are very few performers who could carry a project like this \noff. I've always admired Marvin Gaye, but I didn't expect that he would be one \nof them. Guess I seriously underestimated him. It won't happen again.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Vince Aletti\n\nLater on, many artists from different musical genres covered songs from the \nalbum, most notably live recordings by Aretha Franklin (&quot;Wholy Holy&quot; on Amazing \nGrace) and Donny Hathaway (&quot;What's Going On&quot; on Donny Hathaway Live), as well as \nRobert Palmer's medley of &quot;Mercy Mercy Me/I Want You&quot;, among others. &quot;Mercy \nMercy Me&quot; was featured as the b-side to The Strokes' single &quot;You Only Live \nOnce&quot;.\n\nAwards and accolades\n\nIn 2004, the album's title track was ranked number 4 on Rolling Stone's list of \nthe 500 greatest songs of all time. A 1999 critics poll conducted by British \nnewspaper Guardian/Observer named it the &quot;Greatest Album of the 20th Century&quot;. \nIn 1997, What's Going On was named the 17th greatest album of all time in a \nMusic of the Millennium poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and \nClassic FM. In 1998 Q magazine readers placed it at number 97, while in 2001 the \nTV network VH1 placed it at number 4. In 2003, it was one of 50 recordings \nchosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National \nRecording Registry. What's Going On was ranked #6 on Rolling Stone magazine's \n2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, one of three Gaye albums to be \nincluded, preceded by 1973's Let's Get It On (#165) and 1978's Here My Dear \n(#462). The album is Gaye's highest ranking entry on the list, as well as \nseveral other publications' lists.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview by John Bush (allmusic)\n\nWhat's Going On is not only Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, it's the most important \nand passionate record to come out of soul music, delivered by one of its finest \nvoices, a man finally free to speak his mind and so move from R&amp;B sex symbol to \ntrue recording artist. With What's Going On, Gaye meditated on what had happened \nto the American dream of the past -- as it related to urban decay, environmental \nwoes, military turbulence, police brutality, unemployment, and poverty. These \nfeelings had been bubbling up between 1967 and 1970, during which he felt \nincreasingly caged by Motown's behind-the-times hit machine and restrained from \nexpressing himself seriously through his music. Finally, late in 1970, Gaye \ndecided to record a song that the Four Tops' Obie Benson had brought him, \n&quot;What's Going On.&quot; When Berry Gordy decided not to issue the single, deeming it \nuncommercial, Gaye refused to record any more material until he relented. \nConfirmed by its tremendous commercial success in January 1971, he recorded the \nrest of the album over ten days in March, and Motown released it in late May. \nBesides cementing Marvin Gaye as one of the most important artists in pop music, \nWhat's Going On was far and away the best full-length to issue from the \nsingles-dominated Motown factory, and arguably the best soul album of all time.\n\nConceived as a statement from the viewpoint of a Vietnam veteran (Gaye's brother \nFrankie had returned from a three-year hitch in 1967), What's Going On isn't \njust the question of a baffled soldier returning home to a strange place, but a \npromise that listeners would be informed by what they heard (that missing \nquestion mark in the title certainly wasn't a typo). Instead of releasing \nlisteners from their troubles, as so many of his singles had in the past, Gaye \nused the album to reflect on the climate of the early '70s, rife with civil \nunrest, drug abuse, abandoned children, and the spectre of riots in the near \npast. Alternately depressed and hopeful, angry and jubilant, Gaye saved the most \nsublime, deeply inspired performances of his career for &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The \nEcology),&quot; &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),&quot; and &quot;Save the Children.&quot; \nThe songs and performances, however, furnished only half of a revolution; little \ncould've been accomplished with the Motown sound of previous Marvin Gaye hits \nlike &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot; and &quot;Hitch Hike&quot; or even &quot;I Heard It Through the \nGrapevine.&quot; What's Going On, as he conceived and produced it, was like no other \nrecord heard before it: languid, dark, and jazzy, a series of relaxed grooves \nwith a heavy bottom, filled by thick basslines along with bongos, conga, and \nother percussion. Fortunately, this aesthetic fit in perfectly with the style of \nlongtime Motown session men like bassist James Jamerson and guitarist Joe \nMessina. When the Funk Brothers were, for once, allowed the opportunity to work \nin relaxed, open proceedings, they produced the best work of their careers (and \nindeed, they recognized its importance before any of the Motown executives). \nJamerson's playing on &quot;Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)&quot; functions as the \nlow-end foundation but also its melodic hook, while an improvisatory jam by Eli \nFountain on alto sax furnished the album's opening flourish. (Much credit goes \nto Gaye himself for seizing on these often tossed-off lines as precious; indeed, \nhe spent more time down in the Snakepit than he did in the control room.) Just \nas he'd hoped it would be, What's Going On was Marvin Gaye's masterwork, the \nmost perfect expression of an artist's hope, anger, and concern ever recorded. \n\nOn the Deluxe Edition\n\nIf it's easy to be a little cynical about Universal/Motown's 2001 Deluxe Edition \nreissue of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, it's only because Motown endlessly \nreissued the album during the CD era, trumpeting each as the definitive issue \n(rather ironic for an album Berry Gordy didn't even want to release at the \ntime). Still, Universal's Deluxe Edition series is proving to be a phenomenal \ncollectors-oriented line, filled with lavish, detailed packaging and \nunpredictable turns, and What's Going On is no exception to the rule. To begin \nwith, the remastering of the original album is excellent, the best yet, although \nthat still isn't enough to make this worth buying for the hardcore fans who have \npurchased the album again and again over the years. That's what the other disc \nand a half of bonus material is for. First, there's the &quot;original Detroit mix&quot; \nof the album prepared while Gaye was out of town, filming a movie. A little \nbolder and sparer than the released record, with the strings noticeably \nrelegated to the background, it's interesting, not revelatory, though its \nstripped-back feel is refreshing after hearing the album countless times. A \nrhythm-and-strings mix of &quot;What's Going On&quot; is tacked onto the end of the first \ndisc, before the second disc begins with a new, previously unreleased live album \nthat finds Gaye running through the album (minus &quot;Mercy Mercy Me [The Ecology]&quot;) \nand performing a medley of '60s hits. It was his first performance in four \nyears, and while unnecessary, it is fascinating and certainly worth the time of \nhardcore fans, as are the original single versions of &quot;What's Going On,&quot; &quot;God Is \nLove,&quot; and &quot;Sad Tomorrows,&quot; plus the previously unreleased &quot;Head Title&quot; (aka \n&quot;Distant Lover&quot;). This is certainly a package for fans, but it's also the ideal \nfan package -- beautifully made and filled with rarities that are necessary for \nfans, making them feel fine about buying this record again. Especially since \nthis is so well done, it's hard to imagine Universal/Motown bettering it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSOME TRACKS OVERVIEWED\n\nWHAT'S GOING ON\n\n(on Wikipedia)\n\nIt became a crossover hit single that reached #2 on the pop charts and #1 on the \nR&amp;B charts. A meditation on the troubles and problems of the world, the song \nproved a timely and relatable release, and it marked Gaye's departure from the \npop stylings of 1960s-era Motown towards more personal material. The song topped \na Metro Times list of the 100 Greatest Detroit Songs Of All Time[1], and in \n2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it the fourth greatest song of all time.\n\nDesigned with a somber jazz-inspired tone, &quot;What's Going On&quot; addressed the \npolitical and social troubles of the world and black-on-black crime in a \nsoulful, introspective way, contrasting to the more dramatic socially conscious \nrecords made by Sly &amp; the Family Stone and The Temptations over the previous \nthree years. The song originated from an idea by Four Tops member Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; \nBenson, who, witnessing stressful conditions while on tour in Europe, began \nwriting a song to express his feelings. Once back in the United States, Benson \nand Motown songwriter Al Cleveland prepared an initial rough version of the \nsong, and invited Marvin Gaye as a third collaborator on the song. Gaye, \ndepressed from the death of singing partner Tammi Terrell and strongly \nconsidering a retirement from performing, planned to produce &quot;What's Going On&quot; \nas a single for The Originals, but Benson and Cleveland convinced Gaye to record \nit himself.\n\nOn the finished track, as Gaye musically ponders on the state of the world and \nthe Vietnam war, a party can be heard going on in the background, from which \nGaye's voice is purposely detached. The partygoers are portrayed by Detroit \nLions players Mel Farr and Lem Barney, whose acquaintances Gaye had made during \nhis failed 1970 tryout with the team.\n\nThe song is notable for its heavy use of major seventh and minor seventh chords, \na fairly uncommon occurrence in popular music of that era. Also, notably for \nthis record, Marvin Gaye sings both lead and background vocals himself. The \nprocess had been used for many years to give parts of a recording extra strength \n(Motown themselves had used it on such tracks as The Supremes' &quot;You Keep Me \nHangin' On&quot;), but Gaye took it a step further and sung each of his vocal passes \nin various harmony parts, creating an ethereal sound that became one of his \ntrademarks.\n\nThe song was completed in 1970 before the rest of the album was finished. Motown \nchief Berry Gordy deemed the record &quot;uncommercial&quot; and initially tried to block \nits release as a single. He later relented after Gaye threatened to cease \nrecording permanently. &quot;What's Going On&quot; proved to be a substantial commercial \nhit, paving the way for his forthcoming seminal album release of the same title. \n&quot;What's Going On&quot; was one of the major hits of 1971 as well as Motown's fast \nselling single at that point, reaching #2 for three weeks on the Billboard Hot \n100 and #1 for five weeks on the Billboard R&amp;B charts. The single would \neventually sell over 2.5 million copies, becoming Gaye's biggest US Pop hit \nsince &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; charted in late 1968. The single \nversion (available on the deluxe version of What's Going On, the album) differs \nnoticeably from the album version; in particular, there is stronger percussion \nin the background as well as louder background vocals and noise. Some of Gaye's \nvocals have also been re-recorded to sound slightly punchier. There is also a \nfalse &quot;fade out&quot; that is only on the single version.\n\n(Allmusic's Review)\n\n&quot;What's Going On&quot; was a new kind of protest song, a sugar-coated pill which \nsurveyed the troubled landscape of an America torn apart by war, poverty, and \nprejudice, but reported its findings not with anger and recriminations, but with \ncompassion and tenderness. The song was inspired as much by the bigger picture \nof Vietnam and the civil rights movement as by events in Marvin Gaye's \ntumultuous personal life -- specifically, the return of his brother, Frankie, \nfrom combat; the death of his duet partner, Tammi Terrell; and his \ndisintegrating marriage to wife Anna. ( &quot;What's Going On&quot;'s title, on the other \nhand, originated with Detroit Lions star Mel Farr, who along with teammate Lem \nBarney also contributed backing vocals.) It's first and foremost a song about \nfamily, both literally and figuratively: the plaintive cries of &quot;father, father&quot; \nreflect not only the troubled relationship between Gaye and his biological \nfather, but also the singer's ongoing struggles with God, while the appeals to \n&quot;brother, brother&quot; speak as much to Gaye's own sibling as to the brotherhood of \nall humankind. &quot;What's Going On&quot;'s scope is vast -- the lyrics also touch on \nhot-button subjects spanning from anti-war protests to the generation gap to \npolice violence -- but its message is simple: &quot;Only love can conquer hate.&quot; Gaye \ndoesn't just pose the question &quot;what's going on?,&quot; he answers it, relating his \ntruths with a spiritual power rooted in gospel while tempering the song's bitter \nrealities with gorgeously layered vocals, jazz-inspired rhythms, and luminously \nsoulful saxophone breaks. Indeed, in contrast to the more biting, hardline \npolemics of contemporaries like James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, and Sly &amp; the \nFamily Stone, &quot;What's Going On&quot; is remarkable for its serenity and warmth -- \neven detailing their litany of injustices Gaye's vocals remain implacably calm, \nradiating a Zen-like wisdom and peacefulness. In a major break from Motown \ntradition, Gaye produced the record himself, and while the label certainly \nhadn't shied away from making social and political statements in the past, \nnothing was remotely so explicit and direct as this. Label owner Berry Gordy Jr. \nreportedly hated &quot;What's Going On&quot; and its accompanying LP, probably because it \nfrightened him -- not only did the record threaten to alienate the white \naudiences the company coveted, but it broke free of the famed Motown \nassembly-line production process, liberating artists once and for all. &quot;What's \nGoing On&quot; might not be the biggest hit Motown scored -- the song reached number \ntwo in 1971 -- but it might be the most transcendent.\n\n(Some Songfacts)\n\nThis was written by Motown songwriter Al Cleveland and Four Tops member Renaldo \n&quot;Obie&quot; Benson. Gaye added lyrics and worked on the arrangement. The 3 were \ngolfing partners. Gaye wanted The Originals to record the song, but Benson and \nCleveland prevailed upon Gaye to do it himself.\n\nUntil this song, Gaye rarely participated in the songwriting process. For this \nalbum, he took control of the production so he could make a statement as an \nartist. Motown hated the idea, but Gaye was an established star and had enough \npower to pull it off.\n\nGaye was inspired by the stories his brother Frankie told him when he came back \nfrom the Vietnam war.\n\nThis was one of the first Motown songs to make a powerful political statement. \nStevie Wonder and The Temptations were also recording more serious and \nchallenging material, which was a radical departure from the Motown hits of the \n'60s. The song had a tremendous impact because listeners weren't used to hearing \nsocial commentary from Gaye. As Jackson Browne said in a 2008 interview with \nRolling Stone: &quot;No one was expecting an anti-war song from him. But it was a \nmoment in time when people were willing to hear it from anybody, if it was \nheartfelt. And who better than the person who has talked to you about love and \ndesire?&quot;\n\nGaye was a talented football player, and while he never played in the NFL, he \nwas good friends with Mel Farr and Lem Barney, who played for the Detroit Lions. \n&quot;What's Going On&quot; was an expression they used to greet each other, and Gaye used \nit as the title. Farr and Barney sang backup on the track.\n\nGaye was deeply affected by the death of his partner, Tammi Terrell, a year \nearlier. This led him to take charge of his career and infuse messages in his \nsongs.\n\nThe album takes on many issues, including the environment (&quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;), \nand poverty (&quot;Inner City Blues&quot;). It was the first album Gaye released that sold \na lot of copies. Until then, like most Motown artists, he had lots of hit \nsingles but album sales were secondary.\n\nGaye used an orchestra on this. Motown hated the elaborate production, but were \nthrilled when it became a hit.\n\nGaye wrote this when he could no longer could take refuge in his love songs. His \nmarriage was in shambles (although the divorce wouldn't be final until 1977), \nTammi Terrell (his partner in song and romance) collapsed into his arms during a \nconcert and died in 1970, drug use was pervading the inner city culture and \nMalcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy were all gunned down. (thanks, \nBrad Wind - Miami, FL)\n\nShortly before the terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, a group of artists \nincluding Bono, Michael Stipe, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera recorded \nthis to benefit AIDS research in Africa. After the terrorism, they decided to \ngive half the proceeds to victims of the attacks and the other half to AIDS \ncharities. The song was scheduled for release on World AIDS Day, December 1, but \nwas pushed up to September 21 due to the tragedy.\n\nThe new version was released as a CD single containing different mixes of the \nsong. The first one released as a single was the rock remixed by Fred Durst. \nScott Weiland, Perry Farrell, and Bono were on the track. Other remixes include \nand R&amp;B Mix by Jermaine Dupri, an Electronic Mix by Moby, and a Contemporary Mix \nby Bono.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks on the US, MTV aired a version of this featuring \nfootage of the recording session mixed with images from the attacks.\n\nThe videos for the mixes were directed by Jake Scott, who worked on &quot;Everybody \nHurts&quot; by R.E.M. He had the artists wear blindfolds to demonstrate how some \npeople are blind to issues like racism and religion.\n\n\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING BROTHER (On wikipedia)\n\nThe song started off the song cycle that began with a man returning home from \nfighting in the Vietnam War only to discover that his world is abstractly \ndifferent from what it used to be before he left for duty. In Marvin's case, the \nsong was dedicated to his younger brother, Frankie, who was returning back from \na three-year duty at Vietnam, in essence, Marvin later told interviews that \nFrankie's experience in Vietnam inspired him to collaborate on the songs for the \nWhat's Going On project. Throughout this song, Marvin mentions in his brother's \nthird person about the nightclub, about whether or not his baseball team would \n&quot;win the pennant&quot; and wonders how his friend has been which brings upon the \nquestion, &quot;what's happening brother?&quot; Musically the song follows the same path \nas &quot;What's Going On&quot; and features The Andantes as background vocalists.\n\n\n\nFLYIN' HIGH (IN THE FRIENDLY SKY) (On wikipedia)\n\nThe song continued in a song cycle that had begun with the previous track, \n&quot;What's Happening Brother&quot; as quickly after the song ended with the lyric, \n&quot;Cause I'm slightly behind the time&quot; creating a moody and ominous sound \npunctuated by the singer's falsetto. Co-written with wife Anna Gordy and \nconfidant Elgie Stover, the song talked about drug addiction, the drug of choice \nin the song is heroin as explained in the lyric, &quot;I know I'm hooked my friend/to \nthe boy who makes slaves out of men&quot;.\n\nRelated to the song, numerous Vietnam vets struggled with heroin addiction. \nMarvin later stated the song title was a ploy at an ad made by American Airlines \nironically with the slogan, &quot;flying in the friendly skies&quot;. The song would be \nsampled by several hip-hop musicians. Marvin sings both lead and background \nvocals on this song.\n\nThe song was originally recorded under a slightly different mix a year before as \n&quot;Sad Tomorrows&quot; which Gaye co-wrote by Fuller Gordy and Delores Wilkinson and \nfeatured background vocals by The Originals, with whom had big hits under Gaye's \nproductions. Like the later version of the song, Marvin also sings totally in \nfalsetto. The song also ends faster than the later version and that version was \nlater put in remastered re-issues of What's Going On including the Deluxe \nEdition issue.\n\n\n\nSAVE THE CHILDREN\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nWhile not issued as a single in the U.S., the song was issued as a single by the \nTamla-Motown label in the UK where it peaked at #41 on the Charts in December of \n1971, whereas the other major US single releases initially failed to make a dent \non the other side of the Atlantic. The song was a continuation of the message \n&quot;What's Going On&quot; delivered, about love, this time, for the children. Marvin \nlater joked on the liner notes of the album &quot;not let (this song) influence \nanyone&quot;. Marvin recorded both a spoken word recitation of the song and a vocal \nversion mixing the two vocals together featuring Marvin's soft-spoken vocals on \none side and his expressive tenor on the other. The song would later be covered \nby Diana Ross in a medley featuring the jazz song, &quot;Brown Baby&quot;, on her 1973 \nalbum, Touch Me in the Morning. Marvin sung this song briefly while touring \nEurope in 1976 including the song as part of his What's Going On medley.\n\nFrom Allmusic:\n\nOne of the most impressive stylistic elements of What's Going On is the way that \nMarvin Gaye overdubbed his own voice several times to add an extra emotional \ndimension to the material. The shining example of this technique on What's Going \nOn is &quot;Save The Children,&quot; a heartrending ballad that found Gaye utilizing \ndueling vocal overdubs to get his message across. The lyrics avoid any kind of \nfictional scenario to address the listener directly, asking them &quot;Who's willing \nto save a world/That is destined to die?&quot; before launching into a passionate \ndeclaration that we should &quot;live life for the children.&quot;. The emotional flow of \nthese lyrics is complex but the melody is up to the task of matching it, \nstarting in minor key-styled ballad mode but gradually build in intensity until \nit reaches an emotion-rich peak that gives the finale a glorious gospel feel. \nGaye's recording gives the song the epic sweep it needs thanks to a stylish \nDavid Van De Pitte arrangement that starts with a wordless choir backed by low \nstrings then adds layers of insistent percussion and soulful horns until it \nclimaxes with a flurry of jazzy drum fills and saxophone riffs. When it seems to \nhave reached its peak, it stops on a dime and reverts back to a sad midtempo \nmode that closes out the track before it flows into the intro of &quot;Mercy Mercy Me \n(The Ecology).&quot; It's a strikingly arranged sound but Gaye's vocal are what truly \nallow it to take flight: he starts off speaking the lyrics, then adds a pained \nvocal overdub that counteracts the mellow spoken part with gospel-tinged fire. \nAs the impassion quality of the lyrics hit their peak, the two voices reach a \nlevel of emotion guaranteed to affect even the most hard-hearted listener. &quot;Save \nThe Children&quot; was never released a single but its combination of passion and \nvocal artistry made it a highlight at Gaye's live shows and a favorite with his \nfans. More importantly, it's use of overdubbed vocals paved the way for future \nMarvin Gaye vocal workouts like &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Sexual Healing.&quot; \n\n\nGOD IS LOVE (Wikipedia)\n\nThe song was a return of sorts to Gaye's religious background dedicating this \nsong to God and his father, Marvin Pentz Gay, Sr. The song was originally \nrecorded as the b-side to &quot;What's Going On&quot; shortly after that song was \nrecorded. The original 45&quot; version of &quot;What's Going On&quot; included a slower, \nstring-laden version of this song as its b-side. The song was later retooled in \na more joyous, faster version brought on after the success of &quot;What's Going On&quot; \nas a hit song. It also ended in a much faster and abrupt tone leading into the \nalbum's next single, &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot;. The original version has \nsince been re-issued on several greatest-hits sets and re-issues of the album.\n\n\n\nMERCY MERCY ME (THE ECOLOGY)\n\n(from Wikipedia)\n\nFollowing the breakthrough of the title track's success, this song, written \nsolely by Gaye, became one of his most poignant anthems of sorrow at the world \ndealing with the environment. Led by Gaye playing piano, strings conducted by \nPaul Riser, multi-tracking vocals from Gaye and additional background vocals by \nThe Andantes, the instrumentals provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax \nsolo by Wild Bill Moore, the song rose to #4 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart \nand #1 for two weeks on the R&amp;B singles charts on August 14 through to August \n27, 1971. As the single became his second million seller from What's Going On \nthe album crashed on the soul album charts in the top five, and began charging \nup the pop rankings. &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; soon became one of Gaye's \nmost famous songs in his extensive catalogue. In 2002 it was his third single \nrecording to win a &quot;Grammy Hall of Fame&quot; Award. Like &quot;Inner City Blues&quot;, Bob \nBabbitt, not James Jamerson, plays the bass line.\n\n(from allmusic)\n\n1971 brought in a new era at Motown records; its star attraction Marvin Gaye \ncontroversially broke with the label's proven hitmaking system of recording \nmaterial written for him by others and wrote, produced, and performed his own \nalbum, the master stroke What's Going On. With this landmark recording, Gaye \nbecame a soul music auteur and opened the doors for others like Stevie Wonder to \ntake similar chances. The album is a time-capsule piece addressing many of the \nera's hot-button issues: the war in Vietnam, the environment, racism, and so on. \nFar from being didactic, the album as a whole is one solid conceptual groove, \nalbeit a moody one, allowing one to think while dancing. And the approach to the \nissues at hand -- as evidenced on the environmentally concerned &quot;Mercy Mercy Me \n(The Ecology)&quot; -- is subtle, timeless, and never sermonizing: &quot;Oh mercy mercy \nme/Oh, things ain't what they used to be no, no/Where did all the blue sky \ngo?/Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east.&quot; Gaye's \napproach on the &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),&quot; and most of the album, is one of \ndesperate concern. Though he once characterized the album as &quot;me against the \nman,&quot; the tone rarely approaches anger; rather, his attitude is mostly one of \ndisgusted disappointment. The instrumentation of the song continues to ride the \nconga-drum Latin percussive groove that runs through much of the album. The \nproduction suggests a less-intrusive, updated Phil Spector or Brian Wilson \nethic. There are well-placed horns, piano, voices, synthesizers, even ear-candy \nflourishes like glockenspiel to represent the high end of what could have easily \nbeen a swampy, reverby mix; &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; just jells so well \nthat it is easy to forget that there is so much going on in the track. Lyrics \nand controversy notwithstanding, &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; was a success \ncommercially, hitting number one and finishing number 41 on the 1971 pop chart. \nWhile it sports a catchy pop melody and a passionate vocal performance, &quot;Mercy \nMercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; has a non-traditional song structure: After four stacked \nverses, all beginning with the refrain &quot;mercy mercy me,&quot; the song goes into a \nvocal improvisation over a verse, followed by a bridge of swelling string \norchestration and a jazzy saxophone solo, all building into an outro that \nmeanders into an almost dissonant, eerie minor-key crescendo that just sits \nthere like a question mark at the end of the song. There is nothing approaching \na pop-song chorus, and there is no repetition, save for the refrain opening the \nverses. The myriad cover versions of &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; are mostly \ncrossover jazz versions like Grover Washington Jr.'s. Robert Palmer did a solid \ninterpretation of the song in a medley with &quot;I Want You&quot; in 1990 on his Don't \nExplain LP. \n\n\n\nRIGHT ON (from Wikipedia)\n\nThe song, which talked about the differences between the rich and poor, good and \nevil and other divisions, was built in a different musical texture than previous \nsingles bringing in a Latin soul percussive style including maracas and a flute \nand fluent jazz-styled piano playing from Gaye. The song changed into abstract \nmelodies and harmonies from Marvin with the first half in a settled mood, the \nsecond half a little more hasty as Marvin's lyrical content went from social to \npolitical and the third which was a more modest close in which Marvin preached \nhow &quot;love can conquer hate anytime&quot; and telling someone close to him to come &quot;to \nlive where love is King&quot; before ending in the song's first half musical \nproduction. The song then climaxes with Marvin segueing into &quot;Wholy Holy&quot;. The \ntitle was also referenced in &quot;What's Going On&quot; so prominently and was so \nheralded that Marvin formed a production company titled Right On Productions \nsoon afterwards.\n\n\n\nWHOLY HOLY (from Wikipedia)\n\nStaying with the subject of love bringing Jesus into the theme, the song \nlyrically followed the same path of the Benson/Cleveland/Gaye compositions \n&quot;What's Going On&quot; and &quot;Save the Children&quot; while musically was a much more solemn \nproduction than the previous tune and featured Gaye on lead and background \nvocals. The song would be later covered by soul-gospel greats Aretha Franklin, \nwho sung the song on her Amazing Grace live album and Mavis Staples, who \nfamously covered it during an episode of The Cosby Show.\n\n\n\nINNER CITY BLUES (WANNA MAKE ME HOLLER) (from Wikipedia)\n\nWritten by Gaye and James Nyx, the song depicted the ghettos of inner-city \nAmerica as it discussed how the bleak situation would lead to someone wanting to \nholler and throw ones hands up. The song was recorded in a mellow funk style \nwith Gaye playing piano. Several of the Funk Brothers also contributed, \nincluding Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown, and bassist Bob Babbitt.\n\nThe song helped Gaye make history by being one of the few artists to have three \nor more Top 10 songs off Billboard's Pop Singles chart peaking at #9 and one of \nthe first to have three consecutive #1 hits on Billboard's R&amp;B Singles chart \nwhere it stayed for two weeks. Although not certified by the RIAA at that time, \nall three releases from the What's Going On album gained Gold status by selling \nover a million copies in the United States.\n\nThe final minute of the song (and of the album) is a reprise to the theme of \n&quot;What's Going On&quot;, the album's first song.\n\n(from Allmusic)\n\nIt wouldn't tell the following year that Curtis Mayfield's classic Superfly \nsoundtrack would be released, yet Marvin Gaye's &quot;Inner City Blues (Makes Me \nWanna Holler)&quot; has some of the rich imagery that would make that album so \npoignant and influence hip-hop/ rap artists decades later. It's a credit to \nGaye's amazing talent that he could still, after years of having international \nhits, relate to the travails of inner-city life. Though he sang in a smooth \ntenor, Gaye's pain and anger shines through. A single from his gold masterpiece \nWhat's Going On, &quot;Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)&quot; went to number one \nR&amp;B for two weeks and number nine pop in late 1971. \n\n(and finally, from Songfacts)\n\nMarvin Gaye recorded a string of hit love songs in the '60s which were usually \nwritten by Motown songwriters. In the early '70s, he took control of his career \nand began writing and performing songs with a more socially-conscious message. \nGaye grew up in Washington, DC before moving to Detroit in 1960. This song deals \nwith the poverty and hopelessness people living in the ghettos of urban America \noften felt. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)\n\nGaye gave James Nyx a songwriting credit on this as well as &quot;What's Going On.&quot; \nNyx was a longtime friend of Gaye who helped him organize and arrange his songs.\n\nThis was used in the soundtrack of the 2007 film Zodiac.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn Marvin Gaye (Wikipedia)\n\nMarvin Pentz Gay, Jr., better known by his stage name Marvin Gaye (April 2, 1939 \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ April 1, 1984) was an American singer-songwriter, drummer, pianist and \ninstrumentalist. Starting as a member of the doo-wop group The Moonglows in the \nlate fifties, he ventured into a solo career after the group disbanded in 1960 \nsigning with the Tamla subsidiary of Motown Records. After a year as a session \ndrummer, Gaye ranked as the label's top-selling solo artist during the sixties.\n\nDue to solo hits including &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, &quot;Ain't That \nPeculiar&quot;, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; and his duet singles with singers \nsuch as Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell, he was crowned &quot;The Prince of Motown&quot; and \n&quot;The Prince of Soul&quot;.\n\nNotable for fighting the hit-making but restrictive Motown process in which \nperformers and songwriters and producers were kept separate, Gaye proved with \nalbums like his 1971 What's Going On and his 1973 Let's Get It On that he was \nable to produce music without relying on the system, inspiring fellow Motown \nartists such as Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson to do the same.\n\nHis mid-1970s work including the Let's Get It On and I Want You albums helped \ninfluence the quiet storm, urban adult contemporary and slow jam genres. After a \nself-imposed European exile in the late seventies, Gaye returned on the 1982 \nGrammy-winning hit, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and the Midnight Love album before his \ndeath at the hands of his father on April 1, 1984. He was posthumously inducted \nto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nMarvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was born at 12 p.m. on April 2, 1939 at Freedman's \nHospital in Washington, D.C.. His father, Marvin Gay Sr. of Kentucky, was a \nminister at a Seventh-day Adventist Church sect called the House of God. It \nadvocated strict conduct and mixed teachings of Orthodox Judaism and \nPentecostalism. His mother, Alberta Cooper Gay, of North Carolina, was a \ndomestic mother.\n\nThe eldest son of Gay Sr.'s children, Marvin has a half brother, Michael Cooper \n(b. 1935). Marvin's other siblings included eldest sister Jeanne (b. 1937), \nFrankie (1941-2001) and Zeola &quot;Sweetsie&quot; (b. 1945). The Gays raised their \nchildren at the southwest section of D.C. at the Simple City projects and, after \nMarvin turned 14, lived in the segregated section of Washington, D.C.'s Deanwood \nneighborhood in the northeastern section of the city.\n\nAs a teen, he caddied at Norbeck Country Club in Olney, Maryland. As a child in \nhis father's church, Gaye sang and played instruments in the choir. During high \nschool, he listened to doo-wop and joined the DC Tones as a drummer. After \ndropping out of 11th grade at Cardozo High School, Gaye joined the United States \nAir Force in hopes of flying jets. After faking mental illness, he was \ndischarged. His sergeant stated that Gaye refused to follow orders.\n\nAfter returning to D.C., Gaye reformed the D.C. Tones as The Marquees and Bo \nDiddley signed them to the New York Okeh Records, where they recorded &quot;Wyatt \nEarp&quot;, with &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; as its B-side. It flopped.\n\nDiddley introduced the group to Harvey Fuqua, of the R&amp;B/doo-wop group The \nMoonglows. Fuqua recruited them to be The New Moonglows in 1959 and signed them \nto Chess Records. Gaye and his group sung background on records by Chuck Berry \nand Etta James and had a modest hit with &quot;The Twelve Commandments of Love&quot;. \n&quot;Mama Loochie&quot; (1959) was Gaye's first lead single.\n\nAfter the Moonglows disbanded in 1960, Fuqua brought Gaye to Detroit and he was \nsigned to the local Anna Records label, founded by Gwen Gordy. After Motown \nRecords' Berry Gordy absorbed Anna, Gaye was moved to Motown's Tamla subsidiary. \nGaye found that Fuqua had sold 50% percent of his stake in Gaye to the label \nGaye worked as a session drummer for The Miracles, The Contours, Martha and the \nVandellas, The Marvelettes and others, notably on The Marvelettes' 1961 hit, \n&quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; and Little Stevie Wonder's live version of 1963 hit, \n&quot;Fingertips Pt. 2&quot;. Both singles reached number one of the pop singles chart.\n\nAfter recording at Motown, Gaye changed his name from Marvin Gay to Marvin Gaye, \nadding the 'e' to separate himself from his father, to stop gossip about his \nsexuality, and to imitate his idol, Sam Cooke, who also added an 'e' to his \nname. Gaye and Berry clashed over music to record. Through help from Gaye's \ngirlfriend, Gordy's sister Anna, Berry allowed him to record a standard album.\n\nEarly success\n\nMotown started Artist Development to look after artists. Gaye rebelled against \nreceiving the same tuition as his Motown peers, though he'd later regret that \ndecision. Eventually he stopped &quot;grooming school&quot; though he took its director \nMaxine Powell's advice to not perform with his eyes closed as if &quot;to appear that \nhe wasn't asleep&quot;.\n\nIn June 1961, Gaye issued his first solo recording, The Soulful Moods of Marvin \nGaye, the second album by Motown. The record featured Broadway standards and \njazz-rendered show tunes, and also yielded the R&amp;B ballad single, &quot;Let Your \nConscience Be Your Guide&quot;. The record failed. Gaye released two more failed \nsingles, a cover of The Chordettes' &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;Soldier's Plea&quot; in 1962. Gaye \nwould find his first success as a co-songwriter on the Marvelettes' 1962 hit, \n&quot;Beechwood 4-5789&quot;.\n\nGaye scored his first hit single &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot; in September. The \nsong, co-written by Gaye, was an autobiographical pun on his nonchalant, moody \nbehavior. Produced by William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson and featuring Martha and the \nVandellas (then known as &quot;The Vels&quot;), the recording became a hit on the Hot R&amp;B \nSongs chart. Martha and the Vandellas would also sing background on Gaye's \nsubsequent 1962 album, That Stubborn Kinda Fellow.\n\nThe single would be followed by his first Top 40 singles &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, &quot;Pride \nand Joy&quot; and &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot;, which charted for Gaye in 1963. The success \ncontinued with the 1964 singles &quot;You Are a Wonderful One&quot; (which featured \nbackground by The Supremes), &quot;Try It Baby&quot; (which featured backgrounds from The \nTemptations), &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; and &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, \nwhich became his signature song.\n\nGaye contributed to writing Martha and the Vandellas' 1964 &quot;Dancing in the \nStreet&quot;. His work with Smokey Robinson on the 1966 album, Moods of Marvin Gaye, \nspawned consecutive top ten singles in &quot;I'll Be Doggone&quot; and &quot;Ain't That \nPeculiar&quot;, both of which became the singer's first Billboard charted number-one \nhits of his career peaking at the top spot on the R&amp;B singles chart. Gaye became \na favorite on the teen shows American Bandstand, Shindig!, Hullaballoo and The \nT.A.M.I. Show. He also became one of the few Motown artists to perform at the \nCopacabana. A live album from the Copacabana performances, however, wouldn't be \nissued in nearly 40 years.\n\nTammi Terrell\n\nA number of Gaye's hits for Motown were with female artists such as Kim Weston \nand Mary Wells; the first Gaye/Wells album, 1964's Together, was Gaye's first \ncharting album. However, it was Gaye's work with Tammi Terrell that became the \nmost memorable. Terrell and Gaye had a good rapport and their first album, \n1967's United, birthed the hits &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot; (covered by \nDiana Ross and former Doobie Brothers singer Michael McDonald) and &quot;Your \nPrecious Love&quot;.\n\nReal-life couple Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson provided the writing and \nproduction for the Gaye/Terrell records. While Gaye and Terrell were not lovers \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ though rumors persist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they portrayed lovers on record. Gaye claimed that for \nthe songs he was in love with her. On October 14, 1967, Terrell collapsed into \nGaye's arms while they were performing at the Hampton Institute (now Hampton \nUniversity) homecoming in Hampton, Virginia (in Virginia's Tidewater region, not \nat Hampden-Sydney College, in mid-state Virginia). She was diagnosed with a \nbrain tumor and her health continued to deteriorate.\n\nMotown decided to carry on with Gaye/Terrell recordings, issuing the You're All \nI Need album in 1968, which featured &quot;Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot; and \n&quot;You're All I Need to Get By&quot;. By the final album, Easy in 1969, Terrell's \nvocals were mostly by Valerie Simpson. Two tracks on Easy were archived Terrell \nsolo songs with Gaye's vocals overdubbed.\n\nTerrell's illness put Gaye in a depression; he refused to acknowledge the \nsuccess of his song &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (sample (helpÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·info)), \npreviously recorded in 1967 by Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips, his first #1 hit and \nthe biggest selling single in Motown history to that point, with four million \ncopies sold. His work with producer Norman Whitfield, who produced &quot;Grapevine&quot;, \nresulted in similar success with the singles &quot;Too Busy Thinking About My Baby&quot; \nand &quot;That's the Way Love Is&quot;. Meanwhile, Gaye's marriage was crumbling and he \nwas bored with his music. Wanting creative control, he sought to produce singles \nfor Motown session band The Originals, whose Gaye-produced hits, &quot;Baby I'm For \nReal&quot; and &quot;The Bells&quot;, brought success.\n\nAfter the release of What's Going On, Motown renegotiated a contract with Gaye \nthat allowed him creative control. The deal was worth $1 million, making Gaye \nthe highest-earning black artist. He moved from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972 \nafter being offered a chance to write the score to a blaxploitation film. \nWriting, arranging and producing the movie Trouble Man, Gaye issued the \nsoundtrack and title song in 1972. The soundtrack and single became hits, the \nsingle peaking at the top ten in early 1973.\n\nGaye decided to switch from social to sensual with Let's Get It On in 1973. The \nalbum was a departure for its sensual appeal. Yielded by the title track (sample \n(helpÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·info)) and tracks such as &quot;Come Get to This&quot;, &quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot;, and \n&quot;Distant Lover&quot;, Let's Get It On became Gaye's biggest selling album during his \nlifetime, surpassing What's Going On. Also, with the title track, Gaye broke his \nown record at Motown by surpassing the sales of &quot;I Heard It Through the \nGrapevine&quot;. The album would be hailed &quot;a record unparalleled in its sheer \nsensuality and carnal energy.&quot;\n\nGaye began working on his final duet album, this time with Diana Ross for the \nDiana &amp; Marvin project, an album of duets that began recording in 1972, while \nRoss was pregnant with her second child. Gaye refused to sing if he couldn't \nsmoke in the studio, so the album was recorded by overdubbing Ross and Gaye at \nseparate sessions. Released in fall 1973, the album yielded the US Top 20 hit \nsingles &quot;You're a Special Part of Me and &quot;My Mistake (Was to Love You)&quot; as well \nas the UK versions of The Stylistics's &quot;You Are Everything&quot; at #5 and &quot;Stop, \nLook, Listen (To Your Heart)&quot; at #25, respectively.\n\nIn 1976, Gaye released the I Want You LP, which yielded the title track as the \nnumber-one R&amp;B single, and the modest charter, &quot;After the Dance.&quot; Album tracks \nsuch as &quot;Since I Had You&quot; and &quot;Soon I'll Be Loving You Again&quot; geared Gaye \ntowards more funky material.\n\n&quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; and his final days at Motown\n\nIn 1977, Gaye released the funk single, &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;, which went to \nnumber-one on the pop, R&amp;B and dance singles charts and helped his Live at the \nLondon Palladium album sell two million copies, becoming one of the top ten \nbest-selling albums of the year. The following year, after divorcing his wife, \nAnna, he agreed to remit a portion of his salary and sales of his upcoming album \nas alimony. The result was 1978's Here, My Dear, which addressed the sour points \nof his marriage and almost led to Anna filing a lawsuit for invasion of privacy. \nThat album tanked and Gaye struggled. By 1979, besieged by tax problems and drug \naddictions, Gaye filed for bankruptcy and moved to Hawaii, where he lived in a \nbread van.\n\nIn 1980, he signed with British promoter Jeffrey Kruger to do concerts overseas \nwith the promised highlight of a Royal Command Performance at London's Drury \nLane in front of Princess Margaret. Gaye failed to make the stage; by the time \nhe showed up, everyone had left. While in London, he worked on In Our Lifetime? \nWhen Motown issued the album in 1981, Gaye accused Motown of editing and \nremixing the album without his consent, releasing an unfinished song (&quot;Far \nCry&quot;), altering the album art he requested and removing the question mark from \nthe title - muting its irony. A special edition of the album was released in \nearly 2007.\n\nComeback and sudden death\n\nAfter being offered a chance to clear things up in Ostend, Belgium, he moved \nthere in early 1981. Still upset over Motown's decision to release In Our \nLifetime, he negotiated a release from the label and signed with Columbia \nRecords in 1982, releasing the Midnight Love album late that year. The album \nincluded &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; (sample (helpÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·info)), which was Gaye's last hit.\n\nThe single reached number one on Billboard's R&amp;B chart, where it stayed for ten \nweeks, later crossing to number three on Billboard's Hot 100. The single sold \ntwo million copies in the U.S. earning a platinum certification. The song also \ngave Gaye his first two Grammy Awards (Best R&amp;B Male Vocal Performance, Best R&amp;B \nInstrumental) in February 1983.
