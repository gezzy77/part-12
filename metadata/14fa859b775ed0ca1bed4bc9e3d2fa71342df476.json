The story opens during the Christmas season in New York. M. Fevre-Berthier, the French delegate to the United Nations is a no-show for an important vote, setting in motion a tense search mission by French Press Agency reporter Moreau (Melville) and his alcoholic sidekick, the paparazzi photographer Delmas (Pierre Grasset).\n\nTheir search traverses some of the legendary locations of the Big Apple like Greenwich Village and the theater district, and, of course, they are being followed by a mysterious car.  Using a search strategy based on follow up with the diplomatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probable mistresses, we met actress Judith Nelson (Ginger Hall), singer Virginia Graham (Glenda Leigh), hooker Gloria (Monique Hennessy), exotic dancer Bessie Reed (Michele Bailly) among others.\n\nMoreau and Delmas move inexorably toward a stunning discovery of the French diplomatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate but there are additional plot twists and turns including a final encounter with Fevre-BerthierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter Anne (Christiane Eudes) before matters are finally resolved.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : Two Men In Manhattan.1959.720p.BluRay.x264-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 144 Kbps\nLength            : 4.22 GiB for 1h 24mn 30s 190ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052733&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052733&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: French, English\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14fa859b775ed0ca1bed4bc9e3d2fa71342df476","amp;dn":"Two+Men+In+Manhattan.1959.720p.BluRay.x264-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14fa859b775ed0ca1bed4bc9e3d2fa71342df476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,250,133,155,119,94,208,202,27,237,75,201,227,210,250,113,52,45,244,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
