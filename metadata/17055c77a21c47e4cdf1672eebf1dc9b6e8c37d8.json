But do we really understand his message?\nAt the end of the 19th century, the young missionary Henry Drummond was asked to replace a famous preacher. Though at the beginning he did not convince the audience, they were soon captivated by his analysis of the words of the Apostle Paul.\nThis sermon, The Greatest Thing in the World, has become a classic and is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful texts ever written on love. Drummond broke it down into the following nine elements: patience, kindness, generosity, humility, gentleness, dedication, tolerance, sincerity and innocence.\nContrary to what we are used to hearing, the greatest treasure in the spiritual life is not faith, but love. No matter what your religious beliefs are, this feeling is, without doubt, the most rewarding way to live.\nIn The Supreme Gift, Paulo Coelho adapts Henry DrummondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s text, offering a real and powerful message that will help us incorporate love into our daily life and experience all its transformational power in our lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17055c77a21c47e4cdf1672eebf1dc9b6e8c37d8","amp;dn":"The+Supreme+Gift+-+Paulo+Coelho+-+Mobi+Epub+Pdf+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17055c77a21c47e4cdf1672eebf1dc9b6e8c37d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,5,92,119,162,28,71,228,205,241,103,46,235,241,220,155,110,140,55,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
