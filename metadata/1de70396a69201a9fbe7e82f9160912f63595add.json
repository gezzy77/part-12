These tracks that I have collected under the banner of &amp;#039;Oldies&amp;#039; are a broad spectrum, coming from all aspects of the genre. Theres tracks coming from all the major nighters during the 70&amp;#039;s Wigan,Cleethorpes,Blackpool Mecca as well as the Great original nighters The Golden Torch, The Twisted Wheel and Catacombes. There will be many that you know but hopefully one or two you have been looking for.\nThese tracks were ripped either by me or friends on the scene ( Thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith) and painstakingly put together for your listening pleasure.\nunionjack ~ Soul as Deep as You Like and Some\nps See ya at St Ives Anniversary!!!\n\nMadeleine Bell  Picture Me Gone.mp3\nMajor Lance Investigate.mp3\nMamie Galore    It ain&amp;#039;t necessary .mp3\nMarlena Shaw - Lets Wade In the Water .mp3\nMartha Reeves  Hit &amp; Run.mp3\nMartha Starr Love Is The Only Solution.mp3\nMary Wells - Better Use Your Head.mp3\nMel Wynn Stop sign.mp3\nMike and the Modifiers Waiting round the corner.mp3\nMistura (Feat Lloyd Michels) The Flasher.mp3\nGloria Jones - Tainted love.mp3\nOdds n Ends Apples Peaches Pumpkinpie.MP3\nOlympics  The Same Old Thing.mp3\nOlympics Baby Do The Philly Dog.mp3\nOlympics Secret Agent.mp3\n j.j.
