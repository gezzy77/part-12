The Song Remains The Same  \r\n2. Sick Again\r\n3. Nobody's Fault But Mine  \r\n4. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n5. Since I've Been Loving You  \r\n6. No Quarter  \r\n\r\nCD 2\r\n1. Ten Years Gone\r\n2. The Battle Of Evermore  \r\n3. Going To California\r\n4. Black Country Woman  \r\n5. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp  \r\n6. White Summer\r\n7. Black Mountain Side  \r\n8. Kashmir  \r\n9. Over the Top\r\n\r\nCD 3\r\n1. Heartbreaker  \r\n2. Guitar Solo\r\n3. Achilles Last Stand\r\n4. Stairway To Heaven  \r\n5. Whole Lotta Love\r\n6. Rock And Roll\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nI have listened to alot of &quot;low gen&quot; sources for this show. \r\nThey all have &quot;Millard Markings&quot; most common are cuts during \r\nNo Quarter &amp; Guitar solo. Those 2 songs are complete. Mike \r\nwould also put in pulse channel dropouts  after his tape flips \r\n&amp; and would put silent spots on some of the songs. I guess that \r\nis how he kept track of his trades. These are clean from those \r\n&quot;Markings&quot; and they are the best sounding of all the low gen \r\nversions I have heard.  Winston.\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nFirst of six sold out nights at the Forum, and a great show. The \r\nSong Remains The Same, Sick Again, Kashmir and Achilles Last Stand \r\nare devastating and No Quarter is just the greatest version ever \r\nheard! John Bonham was introduced by Plant as &quot;...the man who fought \r\nfood poisoning and drunk Heineken...&quot;. A great show and not merely \r\nan opening night, but a great show in its own right. It also comes \r\nfrom the best audience recording ever! In fact the Millard tape \r\nsound so great Jimmy used the fragment on the official DVD!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935fd0cf7cb83629a30d86214c6f83682108c313","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.06.21+Los+Angeles%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935fd0cf7cb83629a30d86214c6f83682108c313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,95,208,207,124,184,54,41,163,13,134,33,76,111,131,104,33,8,195,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
