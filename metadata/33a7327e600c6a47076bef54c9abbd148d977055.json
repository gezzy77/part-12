Vaughan deliver original comics directly to readers around the world, who pay whatever the hell they want for each DRM-free issue.\n\nOur first new storyline is THE PRIVATE EYE, a forward-looking mystery we created with colorist Muntsa Vicente. Set in a future where privacy is considered a sacred right and everyone has a secret identity, The Private Eye is a serialized sci-fi detective story for mature readers. You can download our 32-page first issue right now, for any price you think is fair. 100% of your payments go directly into our greedy mitts and will help fund the rest of a story that we're both very proud of (we hope there will be around 10 issues total; an old-school &quot;maxiseries!&quot;), so thanks for reading...\n\nBRIAN and MARCOS &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://panelsyndicate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://panelsyndicate.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------\n\nISSUE ONE\nThe Private Eye - Issue 1\n&quot;The Private Eye&quot; and all related characters are copyright BKV and Marcos MartÃƒÂ­n.\nImmediate download of 32-page comicbook in your choice of PDF, CBR or CBZ.\nNo DRM, no encryption, just plain files optimised for on-screen reading.\nAvailable in English, Spanish &amp; Catalan.\n\n------\n\nBrian K.
