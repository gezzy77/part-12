The first Warcraft game made for DOS. This game also comes with a great manual in .pdf adobe reader format. I believe the manual is a scan of the original document!\n\nIMPORTANT!!! For best results, you should copy the Warcraft folder to your Local Disk (C:) and run it from there for the game to run correctly.\n\nFirst you will need to run the setup.exe program and if you accept the default settings the game should work on XP. (You may have to try different sound settings to get it right) Then run the War.exe to play the game.\n\nIf all else fails, there is an AWESOME DOS emulator called DOSBox (it's free) you could use to run the game.\n \nI suppose it's also worth mentioning that if you are not familiar with using a command line interface then you should instead use the FABULOUS frontend GUI for DOSBox called D-FEND RELOADED (also free). It comes with the newest version of DOSBox already incorporated into the installer package and it makes using DOSBox easy!\n\nIf you enjoy this download leave a positive comment and good rating\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SEED AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS!\n\nCheck out my other torrents!
