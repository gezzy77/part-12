Her style is beautiful and impressive, with sweeping crescendos and perfect tonality and musical progression, all with great thoughtful lyrics and a sense of soul and heart that shines through. This is masterful songwriting and musicianship at its very best, and is not to be missed.\n\nThere are only 6 songs on this EP, but it's practically a full album because you'll play them each twice. This is one of my favorite sets of all time, and that's saying a lot. Highly recommended! &quot;\n\n1. Hush if you Must\n2. Wonder-Dummied\n3. So-So\n4. I Am Mine\n5. Fresh Pair of Eyes\n6. My Legionnaire\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:517f253c5d67b1e1b379dd0d722339f57de42150","amp;dn":"Brooke+Waggoner+-+Fresh+Pair+of+Eyes+%28mp3+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"517f253c5d67b1e1b379dd0d722339f57de42150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,127,37,60,93,103,177,225,179,121,221,13,114,35,57,245,125,228,33,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
