The mere mention of their name today evokes images of suntanned California teens dancing and surfing on the beaches of Malibu. The ultimate good-time music act of the early '60s -- who only earned one gold record (for &quot;Surf City&quot;) -- the duo get credit for inspiring lots of smiles and providing the soundtrack to countless parties, but few listeners, critics, or pop culture historians appreciate just how important they were musically during the first half of the 1960s, or how long it took them to achieve the level of craftsmanship that characterized their music as much as their high harmonies and catchy choruses. Even becoming &quot;Jan &amp; Dean&quot; wasn't easy for this duo. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifoxqe5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifoxqe5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nRemembered mostly for their surfing hits, Jan &amp; Dean had a bit more range than they're generally given credit for. Their roots were in doo wop, and after scoring surf and hot rod hits, they also cut some decent straight pop/rock songs and zany singles that verged on pop satire. Surf City includes just about all the material you'd want from the duo. The 22 songs include the big hits &quot;Surf City,&quot; &quot;Dead Man's Curve,&quot; and &quot;The Little Old Lady (From Pasadena),&quot; of course, but also feature nifty smaller successes like &quot;Honolulu Lulu,&quot; &quot;The New Girl in School,&quot; and &quot;Ride the Wild Surf.&quot; The pair was second only to the Beach Boys in blending high, soaring harmonies with driving vocal surf and hot rod sounds. Of course, they weren't nearly as talented as Brian Wilson's group, but even their minor material has an irrepressible sense of fun and sparking L.A. pop/rock production and melodies. Other highlights include their rearrangement of the old standard &quot;Linda&quot; and the 1965 Top 40 hit &quot;I Found a Girl,&quot; written by P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri. Sloan-Barri also penned their infectious theme for the classic rock film The T.A.M.I. Show, &quot;(Here They Come) From All Over the World,&quot; which deserved to be a bigger hit than it was. The only major omissions of this well-packaged set are their early, heavily doo wop-influenced hits &quot;Jennie Lee,&quot; &quot;Baby Talk,&quot; and &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; which weren't recorded for EMI.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hvfixz8jld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hvfixz8jld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Masters-Surf-City-Best/dp/B000008GZF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Masters-Surf-City-Best/dp/B000008GZF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
