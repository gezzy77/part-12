When special education teacher Torey Hayden first met fifteen-year-old Kevin, he was barricaded under a table. Desperately afraid of the world around him, he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoken a word in eight years. He was considered hopeless, incurable. But Hayden refused to believe it, though she realised it might well take a miracle to break through the walls he had built around himself. With unwavering devotion and gentle, patient love, she set out to free him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and slowly uncovered a shocking violent history and a terrible secret that an unfeeling bureaucracy had simply filed away and forgotten. Torey refused to give up on this tragic Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost case.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ For a trapped and frightened boy desperately needed her help Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and she knew in her heart she could not rest easy until she had rescued him from the darkness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe291465059a10a0c1522098d7f0e6dd3e577e6","amp;dn":"Silent+Boy+-+Torey+Hayden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe291465059a10a0c1522098d7f0e6dd3e577e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,226,145,70,80,89,161,10,12,21,34,9,141,127,14,109,211,229,119,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
