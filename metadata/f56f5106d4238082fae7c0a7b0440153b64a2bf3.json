Enjoying their musical chemistry, the performers kept in touch, and formed B.L.U.E. in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe band had very unusual sound with elements of blues, rock and ambient music. Bruford and Levin were both longtime members of King Crimson, so it\\&amp;#039;s unsurprising that B.L.U.E. sometimes had a \\&quot;Crimsonesque\\&quot; quality.\n=================================\n\nThis contains bands two albums, both studio album and live recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f56f5106d4238082fae7c0a7b0440153b64a2bf3","amp;dn":"Bruford+Levin+Upper+Extremities+discography+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f56f5106d4238082fae7c0a7b0440153b64a2bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,111,81,6,212,35,128,130,250,231,192,167,176,68,1,83,182,74,43,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
