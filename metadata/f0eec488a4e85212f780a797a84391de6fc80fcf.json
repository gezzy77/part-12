When the single Ã¢â‚¬Å“People Need LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released in 1972, it was intended as a one-off collaboration between three successful Swedish pop entities: female singers FÃƒÂ¤lksog and Lyngstad and songwriting/producing duo Ulvaeus and Andersson. The single was credited to the rather unmarketable Ã¢â‚¬Å“BjÃƒÂ¶rn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with no intentions of further capitalizing on the partnership. But the success of the song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Top 20 hit in their native country Ã¢â‚¬â€œ led to an albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of sessions, released throughout parts of Europe as Ring Ring. The title track, a Swedish chart-topper, was a sensation in several languages, including German, Spanish and English (with lyrics penned by Neil Sedaka and Phil Cody). When the group reconvened for their second album Waterloo - the title track of which was a worldwide smash and the winner of the Eurovision Song Contest for 1974 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they were, once and for all, a group named ABBA.\n\nThe deluxe CD/DVD edition of Ring Ring - the final ABBA album to get this expanded treatment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ features no less than 13 bonus tracks, including foreign language versions, non-LP B-sides and even a rare promo-only spoken-word recording. But the real treats are six pre-ABBA recordings featuring the future line-up of the band. BjÃƒÂ¶rn &amp; BennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hej gamle man!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from their album Lycka features backing vocals from Agnetha and Frida. Billy G-sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-LP single Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Little ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ b/w Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Saw It in the MirrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were written and produced by the Andersson-Ulvaeus duo that fueled a decade of ABBA hits, and the quartet also added their magic to singles by Anni-Frid and pop singer Lill-Babs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of which feature here.\n\nDisc 1: Original LP (released as Polar POLS 242, 1973 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ below track list based on Polydor (U.S.) CD 422 843 642-2, 1995) and bonus material\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0eec488a4e85212f780a797a84391de6fc80fcf","amp;dn":"ABBA+-+Ring+Ring+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%282013%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0eec488a4e85212f780a797a84391de6fc80fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,238,196,136,164,232,82,18,247,128,167,151,168,67,145,222,111,200,15,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
