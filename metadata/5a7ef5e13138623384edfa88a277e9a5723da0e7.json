Twelve astronauts made this greatest of all journeys and were indelibly marked by it, for better or for worse. Journalist Andrew Smith tracks down the nine surviving members of this elite group to find their answers to the question &quot;Where do you go after you've been to the Moon?&quot;\n\nA thrilling blend of history, reportage, and memoir, Moondust rekindles the hopeful excitement of an incandescent hour in America's past and captures the bittersweet heroism of those who risked everything to hurl themselves out of the known world -- and who were never again quite able to accept its familiar bounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7ef5e13138623384edfa88a277e9a5723da0e7","amp;dn":"Moondust%3A+In+Search+of+the+Men+Who+Fell+to+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7ef5e13138623384edfa88a277e9a5723da0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,126,245,225,49,56,98,51,132,237,250,136,162,119,233,165,114,61,160,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
