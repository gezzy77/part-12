Additional production by Jermaine Dupri, Jazze Pha, and BAM &amp; Ryan among others, it was released as a retooled version of her limited 2002 album All Eyez on Me which was partially scrapped after the first single's failure and an early leak via the internet.\nAfter the Storm was released to generally mixed but mostly positive reviews among critics.
