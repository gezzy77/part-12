Archival footage, news articles, and photographs mix with contemporary interviews of VergÃƒÂ¨s, friends, associates, and historians. Connections with Nazis are explored, as well as VergÃƒÂ¨s's marriage to Djamila Bouhared, his courtroom methods, his disappearance from 1970 to 1978, and the roots of his radicalism. Throughout, VergÃƒÂ¨s remains playful and charming, with a soupÃƒÂ§on of arrogance. The film suggests VergÃƒÂ¨s's anti-colonial nature is at his center.\n\n\nLanguages: French / German / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ad7661977112b47af2c22dfa60d076687f95fb","amp;dn":"L+Avocat+de+la+Terreur+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ad7661977112b47af2c22dfa60d076687f95fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,173,118,97,151,113,18,180,122,242,194,45,250,96,208,118,104,127,149,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
