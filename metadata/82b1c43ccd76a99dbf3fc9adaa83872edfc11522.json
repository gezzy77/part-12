Over the course of a three hour period, a computer program designed by Stephan Moore deconstructed our sounds, randomly recombined their stems into new pieces, and panned the new pieces through a 36 channel surround sound system we installed on the museum lobby's spiral ramp.\n\nYou can download the program, which will perform the audio in a new and unique way each time you run it, and while listening, we encourage you to go into Danny's mind by exploring the images and videos that he created.\n\nEnjoy - AC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b1c43ccd76a99dbf3fc9adaa83872edfc11522","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective+-+Transverse+Temporal+Gyrus+-+PLAYER+%28OS+X%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b1c43ccd76a99dbf3fc9adaa83872edfc11522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,177,196,60,205,118,169,157,191,63,201,173,170,131,135,46,223,193,21,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
