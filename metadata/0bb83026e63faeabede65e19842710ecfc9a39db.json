The filmmakers capture the spirit of life in a late-sixties commune as well as the Cockettes' hallucinogenic romps - performances foisted on audiences who were in the mood for some wigged-out frivolity. With its archival footage and hilariously frank interviews, the movie makes for a flaming portrait of a cultural moment when free expression reigned supreme. \n\n&quot;They were the first bearded drag queens. They were hippie acid-freak drag queens, which was really new at the time. It still would be new.&quot;\n\n&quot;We really did believe there'd be a revolution any minute, and you wanted to come down on the right side.&quot;\n\n&quot;All he had was the air ticket, not a nickle in his purse. Got in full drag, got on the airplane alone and flew to San Francisco and The Cockettes met him at the airport in a big Media Event. He flipped over, he was Divine forever then. He never went back to being Glen Milstead after that night.&quot;\n\n&quot;People were allowed to live at the end of their imagination. Whatever anyone came out with we said &quot;Yes! Let's have more!&quot;We were born .&quot;to change everything\n\n&quot;The world, for the most part, is shit. You know, with the wars and the banks and the corruption and the lies and the malls and...you know. Forget it. Just give me a torn dress, a hit of acid and let's go to the beach. And that's enough, ya know? That's a lot!&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cockettes.com/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cockettes.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/2657/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/2657/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/cockettes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/cockettes/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000696140&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000696140&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4417&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4417&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/2002/cockettes.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/2002/cockettes.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOyarsa-Q comment:\nThis film takes you on a soaring psychedelic trip to another space and time, a very weird and wonderful place. Such a massive quantity of LSD was ingested by the people in the film (and behind the cameras too, no doubt) you will unavoidably get a most powerful contact high. Like no other documentary I've seen, it's full of sumptuous, dazzling visuals, a feast for the senses, a delight to behold. It's a wonder and a miracle that this other-wordly and essential historical story could be told at all. We are indeed blessed to have all this incredible footage.\n\n\nDVDrip with AutoGK\nSubtitles made with CCExtractor\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 1.37 GiB\nDuration : 1h 39mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 973 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nCodec ID : XVID\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nWidth : 560 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.254\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb83026e63faeabede65e19842710ecfc9a39db","amp;dn":"THE+COCKETTES+%282002%29+%5BSF+acid+drag+commune+c.1969%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb83026e63faeabede65e19842710ecfc9a39db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,184,48,38,230,63,174,171,237,230,94,25,132,39,16,236,252,154,57,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
