InCopy provides a two-way street where editors and writers can edit content in InDesign while a designer simultaneously works on the design portion of the project, and the text formatting is retained in both programs. In this course, learn how to write content using InCopy, style text appropriately so that it transfers to the InDesign layout, and make content available to writers and editors from within InDesign. Author Chad Chelius also ensures you get a handle working with tables, Track Changes, graphics, and templates in InCopy.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding the role of InCopy\n    The InCopy interface and workspaces\n    Working with InCopy documents\n    Creating InCopy stories\n    Workflows between InCopy and InDesign\n    Using Track Changes and notes\n    Working faster with built-in tools\n    Printing and exporting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146447792acfee321faf9941c7a6a11a0e2e8ef8","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+InCopy+CS5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146447792acfee321faf9941c7a6a11a0e2e8ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,100,71,121,42,207,238,50,31,175,153,65,199,166,161,26,14,46,142,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
