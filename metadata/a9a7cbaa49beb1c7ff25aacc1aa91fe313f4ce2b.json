It is also his ode to Russian literature, evoking the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and others in the course of its narrative: the story of Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, an impoverished ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© poet living in Berlin, who dreams of the book he will someday write Ã¢â‚¬â€ a book very much like The Gift itself. One of the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s master prose stylists, Vladimir Nabokov was born in St. Petersburg in 1899. He studied French and Russian literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, then lived in Berlin and Paris, where he launched a brilliant literary career. In 1940 he moved to the United States, and achieved renown as a novelist, poet, critic, and translator. He taught literature at Wellesley, Stanford, Cornell, and Harvard. In 1961 he moved to Montreux, Switzerland, where he died in 1977. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio on CD Unabridged; Unabridged edition (May 20, 2011)\nRead by Alexander Scourby\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9781441873286\nISBN-13: 978-1441873286\nASIN: 1441873287\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
