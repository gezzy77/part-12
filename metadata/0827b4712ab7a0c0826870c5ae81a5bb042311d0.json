In its own way, it was a reaction against the pompous art rock and lumbering arena rock of the early '70s. AC/DC's rock was minimalist -- no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint. Combined with Bon Scott's larynx-shredding vocals, the band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1 Live From Atlantic Studios\n\n01.Live Wire\n02.Problem Child\n03.High Voltage\n04.Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\n05.Dog Eat Dog\n06.The Jack\n07.Whole Lotta Rosie\n08.Rocker\n\n\nDisc 2 Let There Be Rock The Movie/Live In Paris Disc 1\n\n01.Live Wire\n02.Shot Down In Flames\n03.Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\n04.Sin City\n05.Walk All Over You\n06.Bad Boy Boogie\n\n\nDisc 3 Let There Be Rock The Movie/Live In Paris Disc 2\n\n01.The Jack\n02.Highway To Hell\n03.Girls Got Rhythm\n04.High Voltage\n05.Whole Lotta Rosie\n06.Rocker\n07.T.N.T.\n08.Let There Be Rock\n\n\nDisc 4 Volts\n\n01.Dirty Eyes\n02.Touch Too Much (Alt.
