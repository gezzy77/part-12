Tetzlaff uses experience gained as the cinematographer of several Hitchcock films and benefits from a well-constructed script by Mel Dinelli to transpose Woolrich's darkly oppressive vision of New York City into the studio settings of The Window\n\nA real nail-biter of a movie which seemed like a childhood nightmare come to life.\nIn Ian McEwan's telling comment, 'low-budget films, enforce good behaviour'; the best of RKO's post-war thrillers and social dramas thrived on this notion. Tetzlaff's tense movie - from a story by Woolrich - marks a variation on the boy who cried wolf (once too often). Here the boy is an over-imaginative kid whose working-class parents are driven to distraction by his stories. But one night he witnesses a murder. No one believes him, but the killers get to hear of it and decide to kill him.\nThe chase and the climax are brilliantly handled against suitably authentic New York backgrounds.\n\nBobby Driscoll won the Academy Juvenile Award Oscar for this role and in real film noir tradition in late 1967 or early 1968 and penniless, disappeared into Manhattan's underground. On March 30, 1968, about three weeks after his 31st birthday, two boys playing in a deserted East Village tenement at 371 East 10th St. found his body. The medical examination determined that he had died from heart failure caused by an advanced hardening of the arteries because of his longtime drug abuse. There was no identification on the body, and photos taken of it and shown around the neighborhood yielded no positive identification. When Driscoll's body went unclaimed, he was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in New York City's Potter's Field on Hart Island.Still there today.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.09gb\nDuration.... 01:13:26\nCodec....
