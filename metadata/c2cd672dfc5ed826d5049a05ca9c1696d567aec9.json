Sallon Fallon Morell and the Weston A. Price Foundation have promoted traditional diets for many years now. \n\nThere are certain foods that every traditional civilization on the planet used to nourish themselves for millenia. They grew robust and healthy, and didn't die as a result of their bodies falling apart the way we do today. By consuming the whole, natural, traditionally-prepared foods that nourished generation after generation of our ancestors, we can enjoy the same vitality they did. \n\nWith this new book, the Weston A. Price Foundation is promoting the traditional foods of the past for those in most need of them - growing children.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cd672dfc5ed826d5049a05ca9c1696d567aec9","amp;dn":"The+Nourishing+Traditions+Book+of+Baby+and+Child+Care","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cd672dfc5ed826d5049a05ca9c1696d567aec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,205,103,45,252,94,216,38,213,4,154,5,202,156,22,150,213,103,174,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
