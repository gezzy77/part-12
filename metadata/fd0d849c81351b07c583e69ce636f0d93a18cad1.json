In the first series, Detective Inspector Sarah Lund (Sofie GrÃ¥bol) is all set to emigrate to Sweden but her plans are put on hold when the police investigation into the murder of a young girl in Copenhagen turns out to have implications in high places. Each episode chronicles a single day in the investigation, which gradually brings a tangled web of corrupt politics and power struggles to light as the hunt for the killer intensifies. In the second series, set two years later, Lund, who has since been demoted from DI, is called into the homicide department to help her former colleagues on a tricky murder case. Initially reluctant, Lund soon gets involved and discovers that the victim was killed because she knew about the deaths of Afghan citizens at the hands of Danish soldiers. In the third and last series, having found peace after her previous ordeals, Lund has her curiosity ignited when she notices a tattoo on the victim of what seems to be a random murder at the Copenhagen docks. Attention is quickly drawn toward the Zeeland oil business run by the troubled Robert Zeuthen (Anders W. Berthelsen) whose daughter has been kidnapped, and an old flame of Lund's believes that both the kidnapping and murder may be connected to a possible assassination attempt on the prime minister.\r\n\r\nMore info for geeks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0d849c81351b07c583e69ce636f0d93a18cad1","amp;dn":"Forbrydelsen+2007+Complete+Collection+-+MED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0d849c81351b07c583e69ce636f0d93a18cad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,13,132,156,129,53,27,7,197,131,230,156,230,54,240,217,58,24,202,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
