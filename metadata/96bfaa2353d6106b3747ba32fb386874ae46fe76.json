With deft use of examples of humor and wordplay, Steven Pinker weaves our vast knowledge of language into a compelling story: language is a human instinct, wired into our brains by evolution. The Language Instinct received the William James Book Prize from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistics Society of America. This edition includes an update on advances in the science of language since The Language Instinct was first published. \n \nISBN  978-0061336461 \nYear 2007\nPublisher: Harper Perennial Modern Classics\n576pp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96bfaa2353d6106b3747ba32fb386874ae46fe76","amp;dn":"PINKER%2C+Steven++-+The+Language+Instinct.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96bfaa2353d6106b3747ba32fb386874ae46fe76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,191,170,35,83,214,16,107,55,71,186,50,251,56,104,116,174,70,254,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
