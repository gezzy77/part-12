Narrated by actor \nand activist Sean Penn, the film exhumes remarkable \narchival footage of official distortion and exaggeration \nfrom LBJ to George W. Bush, revealing in stunning detail \nhow the American news media have uncritically disseminated \nthe pro-war messages of successive presidential \nadministrations.\n\nWar Made Easy gives special attention to parallels between \nthe Vietnam war and the war in Iraq. Guided by media critic \nNorman SolomonÃƒâ€ s meticulous research and tough-minded \nanalysis, the film presents disturbing examples of \npropaganda and media complicity from the present \nalongside rare footage of political leaders and leading \njournalists from the past, including Lyndon Johnson, \nRichard Nixon, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, dissident \nSenator Wayne Morse, and news correspondents Walter Cronkite \nand Morley Safer.\n\nNorman SolomonÃƒâ€ s work has been praised by the Los Angeles \nTimes as brutally persuasive and essential for those who \nwould like greater context with their bitter morning coffee. \nThis film now offers a chance to see that context on the \nscreen.\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: War.Made.Easy-How.Presidents.and.Pundits.Keep.Spinning.Us.To Death.2007.avi\nFilesize.....: 326 MB (or 334,380 KB or 342,405,120 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:10:16 (126,345 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 514 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 127 kb/s (63/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ã‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 480x286 (1.68:1) [~47:28]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ned2k://|file|War.Made.Easy.2007.avi|342405120|395361A0EDD3A1D85E1B9DFD78D2D5D1|/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101dd8372370cf0d3753f18cd45b1eb5f7e7db8f","amp;dn":"War+Made+Easy+-+How+Presidents+and+Pundits+Keep+Spinning+Us+To+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101dd8372370cf0d3753f18cd45b1eb5f7e7db8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,29,216,55,35,112,207,13,55,83,241,140,212,91,30,181,247,231,219,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
