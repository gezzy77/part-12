Thank You\n\n\n\n\n2nd Drop Records release 'Seven Lies', the debut\nalbum by Felix Manuel aka Djrum (pronounced\n'Drum'). Its sounds are inspired by the rawness of\nurban London, influences of Portishead, DJ Shadow\nand The Cinematic Orchestra, jungle, minimal\ntechno, classic house, broken beat - all seamlessly\nsegued with a nod to jazz vinyl and film music.\nFans will recognise Djrum's iconic tropes on 'Seven\nLies': widescreen atmospheres, dub chords, dusty\nand melancholic strings, obscure film samples. But\nthis time its spread over a bigger, more luxurious\ncanvas that dips like an undulating terrain of sound;\ntechno troughs, bumpy hip hop breaks, euphoric\ndrum and bass, all filtered through the Djrum node.\nFelix would admit himself he is a not a prolific\nproducer. Preferring to craft and hone, often\nallowing music to mutate and diverge down different\npaths, his tracks often top the 8-9 min marks in\nlength. However, each track is never at risk of\nbecoming staid or boring, quite the opposite as\nideas mutate and evolve, subtle differences and\nnuances are evoked and explored.\nInspired by the sounds of Ninja Tune's Solid Steel\nradio show, Oxford born/London based Felix\nbecame....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e61bd85b9649d4b4075beffdd673d5722bb148","amp;dn":"Djrum+-+Seven+Lies+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e61bd85b9649d4b4075beffdd673d5722bb148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,230,27,216,91,150,73,212,180,7,91,239,253,214,115,213,114,43,177,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
