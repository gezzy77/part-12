Witty, hyper-real, and luxurious print designs are being used by fashion designers and in interiors, while artists are harnessing the technology in their work to stunning effect.\n\nThis showcase of the best printed textiles from around the world is divided into three key areas: fashion, interiors, and art.\n\nIn fashion and clothing, the book features innovative printed textile designs in haute couture, prÃƒÂªt-a-porter, and accessories from companies such as Prada, Issey Miyake, HermÃƒÂ¨s, and Vivienne Westwood. The interiors chapter shows surfaces and interior products such as wallpaper, upholstered furniture, fabric hangings, and floor coverings, and features a wide range of designers from Marimekko in Finland to Anna Glover in the UK.\n\nFine-art prints and experimental work from international artists and designers such as Cristian Zuzunaga and Liberty Art Fabrics are represented in the final section","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09e09574a7a9fe1e7e1bc28088a52affea8c6b1","amp;dn":"Print+-+Fashion%2C+Interiors%2C+Art+%28Textile+Print+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09e09574a7a9fe1e7e1bc28088a52affea8c6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,158,9,87,74,122,159,225,231,225,188,40,8,138,82,175,254,168,198,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
