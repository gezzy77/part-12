Written by the foremost experts on the subject, it leverages concepts and techniques from non-related fields such as applied physics and microwave engineering and applies them to high-speed digital designÃ¢â‚¬â€creating the optimal combination between theory and practical applications.\n\nFollowing an introduction to the importance of signal integrity, chapter coverage includes:\n\n    Electromagnetic fundamentals for signal integrity\n    Transmission line fundamentals\n    Crosstalk\n    Non-ideal conductor models, including surface roughness and frequency-      dependent inductance\n    Frequency-dependent properties of dielectrics\n    Differential signaling\n    Mathematical requirements of physical channels\n    S-parameters for digital engineers\n    Non-ideal return paths and via resonance\n    I/O circuits and models\n    Equalization\n    Modeling and budgeting of timing jitter and noise\n    System analysis using response surface modeling \n\nEach chapter includes many figures and numerous examples to help readers relate the concepts to everyday design and concludes with problems for readers to test their understanding of the material. Advanced Signal Integrity for High-Speed Digital Designs is suitable as a textbook for graduate-level courses on signal integrity, for programs taught in industry for professional engineers, and as a reference for the high-speed digital designer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13fc913c195b4653b8fba908feab2d9299d4ea8","amp;dn":"Advanced+Signal+Integrity+for+High+Speed+Digital+Designs.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13fc913c195b4653b8fba908feab2d9299d4ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,63,201,19,193,149,180,101,59,143,186,144,143,234,178,217,41,157,78,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
