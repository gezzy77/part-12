Now it's time for Rush to share his side.\n\nEveryone in Rosemary Beach thinks they know how Rush Finlay and Blaire Wynn fell in love. But Rush is back to tell his side of the story...\n\nRush has earned every bit of his bad-boy reputation. The three-story beach house, luxury car, and line of girls begging for time between his sheets are the envy of every guy in Rosemary Beach, and Rush handles it all with the laid-back cool of a rock starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son. All he needs are his best friend, Grant, and his sister, Nan.\n\nUntil Blaire Wynn drives into town in her beat-up pickup truck with a pistol under her seat. The Alabama farm girl instantly captures RushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention once he discovers that the angelic beauty is his new stepsister, but he vows to keep his distance. Even if she needs his help. Even if he craves her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7536d806456fc065f705bc82c2206ebe84611eb0","amp;dn":"Abbi+Glines-Rush+Too+Far","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7536d806456fc065f705bc82c2206ebe84611eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,54,216,6,69,111,192,101,247,5,188,130,194,32,110,190,132,97,30,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
