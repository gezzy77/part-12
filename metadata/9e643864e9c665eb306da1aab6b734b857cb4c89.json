For nearly forty years, David Harvey has written and lectured on Capital, becoming one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most foremost Marx scholars.\n\nBased on his recent lectures, this current volume aims to bring this depth of learning to a broader audience, guiding first-time readers through a fascinating and deeply rewarding text. A Companion to MarxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Capital offers fresh, original and sometimes critical interpretations of a book that changed the course of history and, as Harvey intimates, may do so again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e643864e9c665eb306da1aab6b734b857cb4c89","amp;dn":"A+Companion+to+Marx%27s+Capital","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e643864e9c665eb306da1aab6b734b857cb4c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,100,56,100,233,198,101,235,48,109,161,170,182,183,52,184,87,203,76,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
