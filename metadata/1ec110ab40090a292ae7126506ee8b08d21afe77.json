Then she took to the streets\n\nThis movie portrays the drug scene in Berlin in the 70s, following tape recordings of Christiane F. 14 years old Christiane lives with her mother and little sister in a typical multi-storey apartment building in Berlin. She&amp;#039;s fascinated by the &amp;#039;Sound&amp;#039;, a new disco with most modern equipment. Although she&amp;#039;s legally too young, she asks a friend to take her (to David Bowie). There she meets Detlef, who&amp;#039;s in a clique where everybody&amp;#039;s on drugs.
