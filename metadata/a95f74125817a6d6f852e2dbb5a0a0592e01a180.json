It was written and drawn by Frank Miller. It was originally published by Dark Horse Comics between November 1993 and May 1994. It was edited by Jerry Prosser.\nSummary\nA Dame to Kill For is a prequel to The Hard Goodbye, as Marv is still alive, but about half-way through after Marv is last seen with Dwight, it is a midquel as some of the events that appear in The Hard Goodbye appear in the background of some parts.\nAmazon.com\nBecause of a shocking ending to the first Sin City book, many people wondered how successful Frank Miller could be with future tales of his no-holds-barred city noir. Enter Dwight McCarthy, a clean-living photographer who tries to avoid trouble because he knows what he's capable of. His tactics don't do him much good when a girl from his past (who he can't say no to) shows up and professes her love for him. When he finds out she's in way over her head, it looks as though trouble has found him. What's going to happen? You guessed it: people get hurt.\nThanks to original scanners and uploaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a95f74125817a6d6f852e2dbb5a0a0592e01a180","amp;dn":"Sin+City-+A+Dame+To+Kill+For+%28Book2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a95f74125817a6d6f852e2dbb5a0a0592e01a180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,95,116,18,88,23,166,214,248,82,226,219,181,160,160,89,46,1,161,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
