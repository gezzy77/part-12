Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a6ec211c50ea18df386014be03b3b092272530","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E06.Motorcycle.Water.Ski.720p.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a6ec211c50ea18df386014be03b3b092272530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,166,236,33,28,80,234,24,223,56,96,20,190,3,179,176,146,39,37,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
