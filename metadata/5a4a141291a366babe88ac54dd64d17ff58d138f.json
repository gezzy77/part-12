Oddly enough, USB keyboards and mice seem to work.\n\n 7) You'll be greeted with a &quot;Welcome to the Amiga OS 4.0 Install CD&quot; window, click on &quot;Proceed&quot;\n 8) On the next window, select your language, country and time zone and click &quot;Use&quot;\n 9) A window will pop up and will ask how the system time should be updated.  Click on &quot;System&quot;\n10) A window will pop up with the message &quot;Your system time has been updated&quot;.  Click on &quot;OK&quot;\n11) Shortly after, a window will appear to advise you that you must select a keyboard.  Click &quot;OK&quot;\n12) Select your keyboard and click &quot;Use&quot;\n\nIf the start up appears to stall between steps 10 and 11, press &quot;Ctrl C&quot; and you should see a &quot;WAIT: ***Break&quot; message appear.  The installer will now continue.\n\nGood luck!\n\n--\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4a141291a366babe88ac54dd64d17ff58d138f","amp;dn":"Amiga+OS+4.0+Install+CD+for+Mac+Mini+G4+%28Moana+Loader%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4a141291a366babe88ac54dd64d17ff58d138f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,74,20,18,145,163,102,186,190,136,172,84,221,100,209,127,245,141,19,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
