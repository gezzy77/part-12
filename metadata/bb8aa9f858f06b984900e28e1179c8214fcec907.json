Photoshop is up-to-date as of June 7th, 2012. \nThere were 2 updates: CameraRaw 7.1 and CSXS. I also configured Photoshop in a \nspecial way to reduce load time while keeping as many features as possible. \nThis is probably the hardest.. we all use Photoshop differently.. so what\ni need.. you may not.. etc. I did my best to keep the general public in mind.\n\nHow to Install: launch PAF installer, select your language, extract to desired \nlocation, launch &quot;PhotoshopXPortable&quot;.\n\nHow to Change Language: simply re-run the installer. Your settings will be\nmaintained, along with your presets, and any changes to your plugins.\n\n-------------------\nBrief Features List\n-------------------\nFile Info (Adobe's Metadata)\nContact Sheet II\nImage Processor\nBatch Converter\n3D, Liquify, etc\nPhotomerge aka Panorama or Stitching\nPDF Presentation\nHDR\nDroplets\nScripts\nCameraRaw 7.1 \n*CameraProfiles/LensProfiles available as separate plugins\netc\n\n* CameraProfiles/LensProfiles are large files, and will extend the load time.\nOnly install it if you truly need it.\n\n---------------------\nRemoved Features List\n---------------------\nService Manager\nSwitchboard\nDynamicLink\nLinguistics\netc\n* basically anything that requires installation, background services, or is\nextremely large in size has been removed.\n\n----------------------\nPortableApps.comFormat\n---------------------- \n- runs naturally on your computer, as if installed.\n- able to use your computer's resources: i.e. RAM, GPU.\n- leaves no trash behind.\n* most beneficial for minimalists who use strictly portable apps. on their PC.\n\n----------------------\nWindows XP Limitations\n----------------------\n* Not all 3D features are unavailable on Windows XP\n* You must have a compatible Graphics Card for 3D/High-intensive plug-ins  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/thread/979969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/thread/979969&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------\nLanguages\n--------- \n*ARABIC, CZECH, DANISH, DUTCH, ENGLISH, FINNISH, FRENCH, GERMAN, *HEBREW,\nHUNGARIAN, ITALIAN, JAPANESE, KOREAN, NORWEGIAN, POLISH, PORTUGUESEBR, RUSSIAN,\nSIMPCHINESE, SPANISH, SPANISHINTERNATIONAL, SWEDISH, TRADCHINESE, TURKISH,\nUKRAINIAN\n\n* Arabic &amp; Hebrew are special language packs.. read here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/mena/using/arabic-hebrew.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/mena/using/arabic-hebrew.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8aa9f858f06b984900e28e1179c8214fcec907","amp;dn":"Adobe.PhotoshopXPortable.CS6.Extended.Multilingual-PAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8aa9f858f06b984900e28e1179c8214fcec907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,138,169,248,88,240,107,152,73,0,226,142,17,121,200,33,79,206,201,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
