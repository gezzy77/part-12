Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The OrderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\no OS:Windows Vista(R)/XP, Windows 7, Windows 8\no Processor:Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo 2.4 Ghz or better, AMD Athlon(TM) X2 2.8 Ghz or better\no Memory:2 GB RAM\no Graphics:NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 8800GTS or better, ATI Radeon(TM) HD 3850 or better\no DirectXÃ‚Â®:9.0c\no Hard Drive:9 GB HD space\no Sound:Standard audio device\n\nInstallation\n\n1.
