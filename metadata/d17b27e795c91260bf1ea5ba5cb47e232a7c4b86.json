Fashionable during the first half of the twentieth century, these popular designs ranged from the simple, stylized motifs found in edgings and tablecloths to superb bouquets of three-dimensional blossoms used in bedspreads, placemats, and doilies.\nWith the patterns in this splendid collection, crocheters can again re-create many of the same eye-catching designs that were once presented in now-rare thread-company instruction booklets of the 1940s and '50s. Included here are designs for a delicate three-piece filet crochet vanity set displaying the timeless beauty of the daffodil; exquisite edgings depicting violets, fuchsias, and begonias; a lovely bedspread titled Friendship Garden; a Rose O' Summer doily centerpiece; a breathtaking doily set titled Forget-Me-Not Swirl; a variety of colorful pansy motifs incorporated in a bedspread, refreshment set, and two diffferent doilies; a lacy lily-of-the-valley doily; and two dozen other irresistible designs.\nEasy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions and 36 finely detailed photographs enable crocheters at all levels to create a treasure chest of stunning, heirloom-quality items. In addition, a brief introduction provides helpful hints on how to care for completed projects through proper washing and blocking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d17b27e795c91260bf1ea5ba5cb47e232a7c4b86","amp;dn":"Dover+Needlework+Series%3A+Floral+Crochet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d17b27e795c91260bf1ea5ba5cb47e232a7c4b86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,123,39,231,149,201,18,96,191,30,165,186,92,180,126,35,42,124,75,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
