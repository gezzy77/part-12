How was it created? How does it work? How do we secure communications on the Internet?\n\nThe impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. \n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081655ccbd8ef5325b2f48064e1969aa1de379e2","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Internet+History%2C+Technology%2C+and+Security","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081655ccbd8ef5325b2f48064e1969aa1de379e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,22,85,204,189,142,245,50,91,47,72,6,78,25,105,170,29,227,121,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
