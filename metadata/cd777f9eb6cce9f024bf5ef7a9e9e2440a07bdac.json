This one probably disappeared among the &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; imitators during the 60&amp;#039;s. A pity, since it is worth having a look at. Some points in its favor: &quot;Unpredictable&quot; - characters who usually don&amp;#039;t die in movies like this die unexpectedly and in unexpected order (it doesn&amp;#039;t follow the clichÃƒÂ©s). The spies sent on undercover missions into Germany are actually forced to speak German, and various ruses to cover up the accents have to be made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd777f9eb6cce9f024bf5ef7a9e9e2440a07bdac","amp;dn":"Operation.Crossbow.1965.DVDrip.XviD.George.Peppard.Sophia+Loren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd777f9eb6cce9f024bf5ef7a9e9e2440a07bdac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,119,127,158,182,204,233,240,36,191,94,247,169,233,226,68,10,7,189,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
