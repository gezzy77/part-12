(Can't Seem To) Get A Line On You [4:24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES from bootlegzone.com;\r\n\r\nSomething to point out; &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; recorded here on 15th March 1969 and featuring Nicky Hopkins on piano, a version of &quot;You Got The Silver&quot; sung by Jagger from 16th February and an early take of â€œSister Morphineâ€ almost without piano. But remarkable is also &quot;Loving Cup&quot; that starts with a striking different piano intro and lasts more than 6:30 minutes. Minimal are the differences in the mix for songs like &quot;You Gotta Move&quot;, &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; second version that all resemble the finished &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; release. On the other side of the coin we have to put the many opening riffs of both &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot; that are tirelessly repeated by an engineer that rolls back and forth the tape looking for a better echo effect, it seems. When the Stones recorded &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; in Muscle Shoals Studios it is said that they tried the song the whole night to get it right, we can feel how they felt while listening to all these false starts. Anyway when the tracks are completed like version number 11 of &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, here comes an early take with Stu on piano and no sax or takes 19 and 20 of &quot;Bitch&quot; where you can hear Jagger ad-libbing over Keith Richards' guitar solo. Last track offered is a primitive version of &quot;Shine A Light&quot; called &quot;(Canâ€™t Seem To) Get A Line On You&quot; that stems from Leon Russellâ€™s session at Olympic Studios in early October 1969 with Jagger on vocals (different words) but this take was officially released in January 1994 on a Leon Russell CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5aa2ed8ca8ed6ba2331edd181e380f01a62fbc","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Sotheby%27s+Reel+1969-1970+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5aa2ed8ca8ed6ba2331edd181e380f01a62fbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,90,162,237,140,168,237,107,162,51,30,221,24,30,56,15,1,166,47,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
