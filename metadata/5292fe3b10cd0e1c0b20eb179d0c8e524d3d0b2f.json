The Windows version was released in the UK on March 24, 1999. The game's selling point was its unique physics engine, in which cars could drive on walls or ceilings because of the airflow passing over them at extreme speeds. The game also featured an original soundtrack by Fatboy Slim.\n\nRollcage allows players to race as one of 6 cars and drivers. The drivers being: Tony, Lothar, Ria, Jet, Leon and Lenny. When the game is completed in &quot;Easy&quot; mode, &quot;Hard&quot; mode and a seventh mysterious driver (who now can race against you) are both unlocked. Completing &quot;Hard&quot; mode allows players to finally race as the seventh driver (a policeman named Yuri). He arguably has the best statistics in the game due to higher speed, grip, and acceleration statistics than anyone else. Only weakness being strength.\n\nCompatibility\nRollcage is compatable with all versions of Windows from Windows 95 to Windows Vista, the game has no problems running on 32bit or 64bit versions of these OSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Rollcage Stage II[/b] is an arcade-style racing game. It is the sequel to Rollcage  and was released in 2000. On top of the basic racing concept, the cars can be equipped with weapons, that are picked up on the track as bonuses, which can be used against competing cars. The automobiles themselves, once again, have wheels that are larger than the body of the car thus creating a car that has no 'right way up' and can be flipped and continue to drive.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstallation notes:\n\nRollcage:\nMount the ISO, install the game and run the patch.\n\nRollcage Stage 2:\nBurn or mount the image and run the patch.\nThere's also a no-cd patch included, this however kills the CD music\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5292fe3b10cd0e1c0b20eb179d0c8e524d3d0b2f","amp;dn":"Rollcage+%2B+Rollcage+Stage+2+%2B+patches%2Ccracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5292fe3b10cd0e1c0b20eb179d0c8e524d3d0b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,146,254,59,16,205,14,28,11,32,235,23,157,12,142,82,77,61,11,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
