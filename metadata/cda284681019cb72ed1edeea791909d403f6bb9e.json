The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled Child's Play: The Series, ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three issue adaptation of Child's Play 3.\n\n\nIn 2007, Devil's Due Publishing obtained the license to publish Child's Play comics and released a one-shot crossover with Hack/Slash titled Hack/Slash vs. Chucky which takes place after the events of the Seed of Chucky film. This was followed by a four-issue series called Chucky, Where he sets his sights on the survivors of his previous killing sprees. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.\n\nEnjoy, seed and if you like it, buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda284681019cb72ed1edeea791909d403f6bb9e","amp;dn":"Child%27s+Play+-+Chucky+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda284681019cb72ed1edeea791909d403f6bb9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,162,132,104,16,25,203,114,237,30,222,234,121,25,9,212,3,246,187,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
