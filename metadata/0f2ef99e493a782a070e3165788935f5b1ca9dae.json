Church, Albert Bierstadt, Winslow Homer, John La Farge, and William Merritt Chase. The tenants worked, taught, exhibited, promoted, and sold their work from their studios and the gallery. This book examines not only the architecture and functions of the building, illustrating a number of the studios, but also the marketing of art in the 19th century. Excerpts from diaries, letters, and autobiographies provide a sense of the congeniality and collaboration among the tenants. A roster of tenants from 1857 to 1895 is included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2ef99e493a782a070e3165788935f5b1ca9dae","amp;dn":"The+Tenth+Street+Studio+Building+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2ef99e493a782a070e3165788935f5b1ca9dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,46,249,158,73,58,120,42,7,14,49,101,120,137,53,245,177,202,157,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
