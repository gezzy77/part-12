The Patagonia garage in which Coco (Juan Villegas) works has gone out of business, and after failing to find employment as a mechanic elsewhere, Coco hits the road to sell his finely crafted homemade knives. When that too proves a noble failure, Coco's life takes an interesting turn when, after rescuing a woman stranded far from home, the kindly wanderer is rewarded with a magnificent, specially-bred Argentine dog that he soon decides to take on the dog-show circuit. Of course the inexperienced Coco will need assistance in navigating the curious world of canine beauty pageants, and after meeting up with a carefree dog trainer named Walter (Walter Donado), the newly emboldened trio hit the road to seek out their fortune in an uncertain -- but certainly promising -- future.\n\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a1e27ef340c6e93593c8c45a63f917ed381eab","amp;dn":"Bombon+El+Perro+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a1e27ef340c6e93593c8c45a63f917ed381eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,161,226,126,243,64,198,233,53,147,200,196,90,99,249,23,237,56,30,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
