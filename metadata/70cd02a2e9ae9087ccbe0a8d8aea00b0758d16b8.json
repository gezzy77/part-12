Col. John Burton was assigned to evaluate the usefulness of the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, an Army troop carrier/scout vehicle that, in its final redesign, was effectively a deathtrap for its occupants.

Partridge, in order to get it under construction and in the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70cd02a2e9ae9087ccbe0a8d8aea00b0758d16b8","amp;dn":"The+Pentagon+Wars+%281998%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70cd02a2e9ae9087ccbe0a8d8aea00b0758d16b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,205,2,162,233,174,144,135,204,190,10,141,138,234,0,176,117,141,22,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
