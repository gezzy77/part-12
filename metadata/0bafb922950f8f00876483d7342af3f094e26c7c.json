These courses are also freely available http://oyc.yale.edu/. \n\nThe torrent is useful because now you don't have to go to a separate webpage for every session of a course and separately download the mp3, but you can have them in one go. Furthermore, I provided some meaningful tags and filenames for the mp3 files. Should save you a day. \n\nYou can use these audio courses as audio books on any mp3 player.\n\nAll courses are recorded in a bitrate of 128kbps, in stereo. Also note that a couple of courses are zipped. I had to do this because otherwise the torrent could not be uploaded because of too many files on some torrent sites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bafb922950f8f00876483d7342af3f094e26c7c","amp;dn":"Complete+Open+Yale+Courses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bafb922950f8f00876483d7342af3f094e26c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,175,185,34,149,15,143,0,135,100,131,215,52,42,243,240,148,226,108,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
