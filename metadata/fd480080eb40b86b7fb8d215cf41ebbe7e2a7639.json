His first book of poetry, The North Ship, was published in 1945, followed by two novels, Jill (1946) and A Girl in Winter (1947), and he came to prominence in 1955 with the publication of his second collection of poems, The Less Deceived, followed by The Whitsun Weddings (1964) and High Windows (1974). He contributed to The Daily Telegraph as its jazz critic from 1961 to 1971, articles gathered in All What Jazz: A Record Diary 1961Ã¢â‚¬â€œ71 (1985), and he edited The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse (1973). His many honours include the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. He was offered, but declined, the position of Poet Laureate in 1984, following the death of John Betjeman.\n\nLarkin's poetry has been characterized as combining &quot;an ordinary, colloquial style&quot;, &quot;clarity&quot;, a &quot;quiet, reflective tone&quot;, &quot;ironic understatement&quot; and a &quot;direct&quot; engagement with &quot;commonplace experiences&quot;, while Jean Hartley summed his style up as a &quot;piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent&quot;.\n\nLarkin's earliest work showed the influence of Eliot, Auden and Yeats, and the development of his mature poetic identity in the early 1950s coincided with the growing influence on him of Thomas Hardy. The &quot;mature&quot; Larkin style, first evident in The Less Deceived, is &quot;that of the detached, sometimes lugubrious, sometimes tender observer&quot;, who, in Hartley's phrase, looks at &quot;ordinary people doing ordinary things&quot;. He disparaged poems that relied on &quot;shared classical and literary allusions - what he called the myth-kitty, and the poems are never cluttered with elaborate imagery.&quot; Larkin's mature poetic persona is notable for its &quot;plainness and scepticism&quot;. Other recurrent features of his mature work are sudden openings and &quot;highly-structured but flexible verse forms&quot;.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* High Windows\n\n* Philip Larkin Poems - Selected by Martin Amis\n\n* Letters to Monica\n\n* The Whitsun Weddings\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.philiplarkin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.philiplarkin.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3153/the-art-of-poetry-no-30-philip-larkin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3153/the-art-of-poetry-no-30-philip-larkin&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd480080eb40b86b7fb8d215cf41ebbe7e2a7639","amp;dn":"Philip+Larkin+-+Poetry+and+Letters+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd480080eb40b86b7fb8d215cf41ebbe7e2a7639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,72,0,128,235,64,184,107,127,184,210,21,207,65,235,190,126,42,118,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
