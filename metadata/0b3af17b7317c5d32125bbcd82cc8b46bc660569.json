It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, \nand was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 \nrelease The Unforgettable Fire, U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound on The Joshua Tree within the limitation \nof strict song structures. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music and depicts the bands \nlove-hate relationship with the United States, with socially and politically conscious lyrics embellished \nwith spiritual imagery.\n\nInspired by American tour experiences, literature, and politics, U2 chose America as a theme for the record. \nRecording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group recorded \nin two houses, in addition to two professional studios. Several events during the sessions helped shape the \nconscious tone of the album, including the band's participation in A Conspiracy of Hope tour, the death of \nroadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono's travels to Central America. Recording was completed in November \nand additional production continued into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a &quot;cinematic&quot; quality \nfor the record that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented \nthis in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes...\n\n\n\n   1. U2 - Where the Streets Have No Name                     [05:39]\n   2.
