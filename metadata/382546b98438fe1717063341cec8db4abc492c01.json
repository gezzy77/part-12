Taking a cognitive developmental systems approach that uses elevation to build body awareness and focus the children on people and objects, the Miller Method[registered] works on the premise that children with ASDs learn more effectively when their whole bodies are physically and repetitively involved in a learning process or 'system'; a completely different approach from the more traditional schoolroom arrangement in which children learn while sitting at a desk. Chapters outline the underlying principles of the Miller Method[registered] and its practical application, and cover major issues such as communication skills and social play, and day-to-day behavioural issues including tantrums, aggression, and toilet training. A chapter on research outcomes demonstrates the efficacy of the method in practice. This practical resource is essential reading for parents and professionals living and working with children with ASDs.\nAbout the Author\nArnold Miller, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, is Executive Director of the Language and Cognitive Development Center of Boston as well as Affiliate Professor of Psychology, Clark University. Kristina Chretien works as cognitive-developmental therapist at the Language and Cognitive Development Center of Boston.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 320 pages\n    * Publisher: Jessica Kingsley Pub; 1 edition (February 15, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1843107228\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1843107224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382546b98438fe1717063341cec8db4abc492c01","amp;dn":"Developing+the+Capacities+of+Children+on+the+Autism+Spectrum+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382546b98438fe1717063341cec8db4abc492c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,37,70,185,132,56,254,23,23,6,51,65,206,200,219,74,188,73,44,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
