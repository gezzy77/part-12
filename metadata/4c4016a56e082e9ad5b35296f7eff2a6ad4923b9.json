Echoing the likes of Green Day, the Ramones, and the Vandals (whose guitarist Warren Fitzgerald produced the album, and whose founder, Joe Escalante, signed them to Kung Fu), the Ataris put an upbeat spin on their social instabilities. Kris Rowe sings of young love gone amok over catchy, bouncy pop-punk in album that&amp;#039;s more raw and pure than later recordings. Recording 20 tracks showed the Ataris weren&amp;#039;t afraid to take chances, like covering the infectious &quot;Boxcar&quot; by vaunted Jawbreaker.  \n\nAlternative Press (8/02, p.90) - &quot;...The Holy Grail for Ataris fans...essential listening...&quot;\n\nNME (Magazine) (6/8/02, p.33) - 6 out of 10 - &quot;...The next Ataris album proper should propel them into the mainstream, but in the meantime...a spirited stopgap.&quot;\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4016a56e082e9ad5b35296f7eff2a6ad4923b9","amp;dn":"The+Ataris+-+...Anywhere+But+Here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4016a56e082e9ad5b35296f7eff2a6ad4923b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,64,22,165,110,8,46,154,213,179,82,150,247,239,242,166,173,73,35,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
