The award assisted in the production of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut self titled album. Last year Busby Marou won the Deadly Award for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Most Promising New Talent in MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and a Q Song award for their song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPaint My Cup.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nIn late 2010, the boys were approached by former Managing Director of EMI, John OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell, to feature as the only unsigned act (together with Australia and New ZealandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most successful male artists) on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“He Will Have His Way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Finn Brothers Tribute AlbumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The album went ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ within a month of release and Busby MarouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of the Crowded House classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Better Be Home SoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was spun on radio playlists across Australia and New Zealand and has been nominated.\nThe Album is currently being rotated on radio playlists across Australia and the first single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Biding My TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has recently been added to the Triple J playlist. The duo and band have shared the stage with the likes of Powderfinger, Pete Murray,The Panics, Archie Roach and many more. \nJeremy Marou, a proud Torres Strait Islander has a unique and rare musical talent. He excels on just about every instrument he touches including ukulele, bass, drums and piano, however, it is his natural ability on the guitar that makes you stop and listen. His experience with traditional Murray Island song and dance as a child shines though his melodies. \nThis combined with Thomas BusbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distinctly Australian way of sharing stories has developed into a unique Australian song writing flavour with cracking harmonies, breathtaking musicianship and a natural feel for each others guitars!!\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nPLEASE SEED\n[url] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/06/27/busby-marou/[/url]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/06/27/busby-marou/[/url]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d2239f05e2866a46f5732c8866ed2f3a2495ea","amp;dn":"Busby+Marou...Busby+Marou%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d2239f05e2866a46f5732c8866ed2f3a2495ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,210,35,159,5,226,134,106,70,245,115,44,136,102,237,47,58,36,149,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
