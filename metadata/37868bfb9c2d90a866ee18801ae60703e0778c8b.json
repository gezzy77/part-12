The songs are first-rate, and there are a lot of them - 19 in all, ranging from grim nightlife memoirs (&quot;9th and Hennepin,&quot; &quot;Singapore&quot;) to portraits of small-time hustlers (&quot;Gun Street Girl,&quot; &quot;Union Square&quot;) to bursts of street-corner philosophy (&quot;Blind Love,&quot; &quot;Time&quot;). The album also contains the original version of &quot;Downtown Train,&quot; which Rod Stewart turned into a smash hit. The image of &quot;rain dogs&quot; - animals who've lost their way home because the rain has washed away their scent - is an appropriate symbol for the entire cast of characters Waits has brought to life over the years, and this album has thus far proved to be his most enduring effort.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTom Waits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals, Guitar, Farfisa Organ, Piano, Pump Organ, Banjo, Harmonium \nMichael Blair - Percussion, Marimba, Congas, Drums, Metal Percussion, Bowed Saw, Parade Drum \nStephen Taylor Arvizu Hodges - Drums, Parade Drums \nLarry Taylor - Double Bass, Bass\nMarc Ribot - Guitar, Lead Guitar \nChris Spedding - Guitar \nHollywood Paul Litteral - Trumpet \nTony Garnier - Double Bass \nBobby Previte - Percussion, Marimba \nWilliam Schimmel - Accordion \nBob Funk - Trombone \nRalph Carney - Baritone Sax, Sax, Clarinet \nGreg Cohen - Double Bass \nKeith Richards - Guitar, Backing Vocals \nRobert Musso - Banjo \nArno Hecht - Tenor Sax \nCrispin Cioe - Sax \nRobert Quine - Guitar \nRoss Levinson - Violins \nJohn Lurie - Alto Sax \nG.E.
