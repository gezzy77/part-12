Among his many honors are a MacArthur Prize Fellowship, a National Book Critics Circle Award, election to the French Legion of Honor, the National Humanities Medal conferred by President Obama in February 2012, and the Del Duca World Prize in the Humanities awarded by the Institut de France in 2013.\n\nThroughout his career Darnton has concerned himself with the literary world of Enlightenment France, often focusing not on the philosophes but on writers outside the first rank and the material they produced.  In the course of this work Darnton has developed an influential anthropological approach to history, has advanced novel interpretations of the French Revolution, and has helped to create the field known as &quot;the history of the book.&quot;  He also has a longstanding interest in electronic books, Web publishing, and other new media.\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* THE BUSINESS OF ENLIGHTENMENT: A Publishing History of the EncyclopÃƒÂ©die, 1775-1800 (Harvard University Press, 1979)\n\n* THE CASE FOR BOOKS: Past, Present, and Future (PublicAffairs, 2009)  -- EPUB (courtesy of livhre)\n\n* GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FALSE TEETH: An Unconventional Guide to the Eighteenth Century (Norton, 2003)\n\n* THE GREAT CAT MASSACRE &amp; OTHER EPISODES IN FRENCH CULTURAL HISTORY (Basic Books, 1984) -- PDF and EPUB\n\n* MESMERISM AND THE END OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN FRANCE (Harvard University Press, 1968)\n\n* POETRY AND THE POLICE: Communication Networks In Eighteenth-Century Paris (Harvard University Press, 2010)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f06b3c3de04418cd76d24c565e79c9f328ac116","amp;dn":"Robert+Darnton+-+18th+Century+Cultural+History+%286+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f06b3c3de04418cd76d24c565e79c9f328ac116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,6,179,195,222,4,65,140,215,109,36,197,101,231,156,159,50,138,193,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
