Later, the losing team faces a pressure test making donuts.\n\nThis episode originally aired on CTV on April 7, 2014. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.\n\nThere are several comments online about the POKE release, saying that that file causes problems, in particular on PS3 systems. This file should work fine on any system, though as I said above, the video and audio quality isn't going to win any awards.  \n\nTo leave comments/questions for me, use kickass or thepiratebay.\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            Masterchef.Canada.S01E12.Line.of.Fire.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            440,436,736 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             43:52.150\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              1203 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              128 kbps\nBitrate Type:         CBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4388f231816fd3ca7357259585fa2197e12847","amp;dn":"Masterchef+Canada+S01E12+Line+of+Fire+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4388f231816fd3ca7357259585fa2197e12847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,67,136,242,49,129,111,211,202,115,87,37,149,133,250,33,151,225,40,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
