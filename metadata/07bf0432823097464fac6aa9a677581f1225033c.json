Lost at Sea reveals how deep our collective craziness lies, even in the most mundane circumstances.\n\nRonson investigates the strange things weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to believe in, from lifelike robots programmed with our loved onesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personalities to indigo children to hypersuccessful spiritual healers to the Insane Clown PosseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s juggalo fans. He looks at ordinary lives that take on extraordinary perspectives, for instance a pop singer whose lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest passion is the coming alien invasion, and the scientist designated to greet those aliens when they arrive. Ronson throws himself into the storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€in a tour de force piece, he splits himself into multiple Ronsons (Happy, Paul, and Titch, among others) to get to the bottom of credit card companiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ predatory tactics and the murky, fabulously wealthy companies behind those tactics. Amateur nuclear physicists, assisted-suicide practitioners, the town of North Pole, AlaskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Christmas-induced high school mass-murder plot: Ronson explores all these tales with a sense of higher purpose and universality, and suddenly, mid-read, they are stories not about the fringe of society or about people far removed from our own experience, but about all of us.\n\nIncisive and hilarious, poignant and maddening, revealing and disturbingÃ¢â‚¬â€Ronson writes about our modern world, the foibles of contemporary culture, and the chaos that lies at the edge of our daily lives.(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bf0432823097464fac6aa9a677581f1225033c","amp;dn":"Lost+At+Sea+-+Jon+Ronson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bf0432823097464fac6aa9a677581f1225033c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,191,4,50,130,48,151,70,79,172,106,169,166,119,88,31,18,37,3,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
