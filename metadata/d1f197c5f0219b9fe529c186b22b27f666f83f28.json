So much talent and so little to show for it. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re never going to do anything with your life.&quot; Tony had a singsong voice, like one of his own parrots, but there was no mistaking the edge. &quot;Perhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re right,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I answered. Inside I was thinking, Watch me.&quot;\n\nIn A Story Lately Told, Anjelica Huston described her enchanted childhood in Ireland and her glamorous but troubled late teens in London. That memoir of her early years ended when Anjelica stepped into Hollywood. In Watch Me, Huston tells the story of falling in love with Jack Nicholson and her adventurous, turbulent, high-profile, spirited 17-year relationship with him and his intoxicating circle of friends. She writes about learning the art and craft of acting, about her Academy Award-winning portrayal of Maerose Prizzi in PrizziÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Honor, about her roles as Morticia Addams in the Addams Family films, Etheline Tenenbaum in The Royal Tenenbaums and Lilly Dillon in The Grifters, and about her collaborations with many great directors, including Woody Allen, Wes Anderson, Bob Rafelson, Francis Ford Coppola, and Stephen Frears. She movingly and beautifully writes about the death of her father, the legendary director John Huston, and her marriage to sculptor Robert Graham. She is candid, mischievous, warm, passionate, funny, and a superb storyteller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f197c5f0219b9fe529c186b22b27f666f83f28","amp;dn":"Watch+Me%3A+A+Memoir+-+Anjelica+Huston+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f197c5f0219b9fe529c186b22b27f666f83f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,241,151,197,240,33,155,159,229,41,193,134,178,43,39,246,102,248,63,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
