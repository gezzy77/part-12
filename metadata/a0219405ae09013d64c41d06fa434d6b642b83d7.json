This is the E Street Band fronted by Ã¢â‚¬Å“LoserÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-era Beck, and big, wide-angle-lens crowd pleasers like &quot;Get Me Through the Night,&quot; &quot;Forgotten Days,&quot; &quot;Put Me to Work,&quot; and &quot;Young Rut&quot; -- the latter two of which found homes in headphones and hearts as heavily circulated singles in the months prior to the album's release -- make strong first impressions. Tender Madness also boasts its fair share of midtempo, suburban R&amp;B jams like the amiable and wry (&quot;I want to hold you, but I feel like a baby) &quot;Cotton Candy,&quot; high (as in wasted) and lonesome juke joint laments (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Replacements [Curls in the Grass]Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), the latter a duet with country crooner and Secret Sister Lydia Rogers, and evocative slices of 21st century Americana, like the lovely &quot;If the Moon Rises,&quot; all of which add up to a surprisingly affecting debut that looks a little redundant on paper, but with an open heart and a slight buzz, knocks it out of the park through a pair of thrift shop speakers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0219405ae09013d64c41d06fa434d6b642b83d7","amp;dn":"PAPA+-+Tender+Madness+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0219405ae09013d64c41d06fa434d6b642b83d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,33,148,5,174,9,1,61,100,196,29,6,250,67,77,107,100,43,131,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
