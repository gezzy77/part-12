This illustrated version contains detailed, masterly engravings by Gustave DorÃƒÂ©s, from a 19th-century edition of The Raven, among the most popular American poems ever written. Dreamlike, otherworldly illustrations perfectly capture the bleak despair and mournful musings of PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poem. Includes an introduction/analysis by Edmund. C. Stedman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b01ee1b4abefcdfcd96b67c0cbe511ebd2326a","amp;dn":"The+Raven+by+Edgar+Allan+Poe+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b01ee1b4abefcdfcd96b67c0cbe511ebd2326a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,176,30,225,180,171,239,205,252,217,107,103,192,203,229,17,235,210,50,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
