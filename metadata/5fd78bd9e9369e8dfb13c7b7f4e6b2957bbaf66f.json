The British Hit Singles &amp; Albums noted that they were &quot;tartan teen sensations from Edinburgh&quot;, and were &quot;the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since The Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s&quot;.[1] For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed &quot;Rollermania&quot;), they were worldwide teen idols. The group's line-up featured numerous changes over the years, but the classic line-up during its heyday included guitarists Eric Faulkner and Stuart Wood, singer Les McKeown, bassist Alan Longmuir, and drummer Derek Longmuir.[2]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd78bd9e9369e8dfb13c7b7f4e6b2957bbaf66f","amp;dn":"Bay+City+Rollers-Greatest+Hits-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd78bd9e9369e8dfb13c7b7f4e6b2957bbaf66f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,215,139,217,233,54,158,141,251,19,199,183,244,230,178,149,123,186,246,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
