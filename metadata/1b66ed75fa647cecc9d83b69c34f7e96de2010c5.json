A clean, unobtrusive sound with a natural falloff that floats and complements the source material perfectly. Designed to imitate complex, natural spaces, it is also very easy to use. The main 'cloud' display represents the reverb in terms of time and frequency, showing all the main parameters and EQ in a natural way. The reverberation can be dampened in the upper and lower frequencies, allowing soft sibilance and a graceful, lifting air to the sound.\n\nHaving very few controls does not hinder Fusion Field's usefulness. The dial ranges have been sloped to give the best sensitivity in useful regions, and the whole unit can create short snappy rooms, or vast time-suspended spaces, and anything in between.\n\nNothing Special.\n\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n\n\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b66ed75fa647cecc9d83b69c34f7e96de2010c5","amp;dn":"QuikQuak+-+Fusion+Field+v3.32+-+AU.VST+-+OS+X+-+R2R+%5Bpacket-dada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b66ed75fa647cecc9d83b69c34f7e96de2010c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,102,237,117,250,100,124,236,201,216,59,105,195,79,126,150,222,32,16,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
