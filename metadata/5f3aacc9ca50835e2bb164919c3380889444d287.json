Common wisdom has held that incompetent military commanders and political leaders in Britain must have been to blame, but were they? This intriguing book makes a different argument. Weaving together the personal stories of ten prominent men who directed the British dimension of the war, historian Andrew OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Shaughnessy dispels the incompetence myth and uncovers the real reasons that rebellious colonials were able to achieve their surprising victory.\n\nIn interlinked biographical chapters, the author follows the course of the war from the perspectives of King George III, Prime Minister Lord North, military leaders including General Burgoyne, the Earl of Sandwich, and others who, for the most part, led ably and even brilliantly. Victories were frequent, and in fact the British conquered every American city at some stage of the Revolutionary War. Yet roiling political complexities at home, combined with the fervency of the fighting Americans, proved fatal to the British war effort. The book concludes with a penetrating assessment of the years after Yorktown, when the British achieved victories against the French and Spanish, thereby keeping intact what remained of the British Empire.\n\nWinner of the 2014 New-York Historical Society American History Book Prize\n\nRichard Johnson\n\n&quot;Much of [the book's] value lies in the sheer volume of engaging material it brings together and in the originality of its organization and approach to a much studied question, namely why Britain lost the War of the American Revolution. . . . A treasure-trove of information on the British operation of the War.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Richard Johnson, University of Washington \n\nJon Meacham\n\n&quot;Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy has written a remarkable book about an important but curiously underappreciated subject: the British side of the American Revolution. With meticulous scholarship and an eloquent writing style, O'Shaughnessy gives us a fresh and compelling view of a critical aspect of the struggle that changed the world. This is a great book.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Jon Meacham, author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power\n\nGary Hart\n\n&quot;Scrupulously researched and superbly written, these humanizing portraits of conventional cardboard figures from American history offer, like all great history, lessons for today: military might does not guarantee political success; do not try to govern that which you do not own; and resist empire's temptations.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Gary Hart, United States Senator (Ret.)\n\nAlan Taylor\n\n&quot;Deeply researched, carefully argued, and clearly written, The Men Who Lost America cuts through the thick crust of romantic myths to cast the American Revolution in a refreshing new light. Blessed with an impartial, open mind, Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy reveals the talents as well as the human foibles of a rich cast of intriguing characters including America's last king. In the end, O'Shaughnessy gives the American revolutionaries exactly what their story has so long needed: worthy adversaries who fought hard and well.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Alan Taylor, author of The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, &amp; Indian Allies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f3aacc9ca50835e2bb164919c3380889444d287","amp;dn":"Andrew+Jackson+O%27Shaughnessy+-+The+Men+Who+Lost+America+%5B96%5D+Una","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f3aacc9ca50835e2bb164919c3380889444d287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,58,172,201,202,80,131,94,43,177,100,145,156,51,128,136,148,68,210,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
