Source had more issues then i had with my girlfriend.  oh boy...90% of movie i cant really see a single thing.. there is point in movie almost for 8 to 10mins you cant really see a single thing, but luckily it was not that important. i did not cut it cuz you can still hear audio.  then there is focus issue in, out several times, there was perspective issue too which i 50% fixed rest i dont care... and a bit flicker as well. \r\n\r\nanyways i contrast the Sh*t out of it for syncing purposes.  i used UnKown audio  which was good. it was and to sync But i pretty much did well all the way. i wasted my good hours on it.. anyways i took that as challenge. so whatever you say ....\r\n\r\nwe work on all available public sources some good and some bad, (not talking about privates :D )  so, every time we work on something we put it out for ya. with Honest to the point brutal notes and samples with screens so you know exactly what you are going for.\r\n\r\nto be honest this early CAM rating is V4,A7 for a Cam. well, i think others have put worse then us. :D :D :P\r\n\r\nwe have something in pocket will surely hold for line :)\r\noh! btw..  it was a very good movie.. :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9L8 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9La \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9Lw \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9L2 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9LN \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9LT \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9Lj \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/9Ln","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e092673a30dddd3f18d703516cb4337216ac67b","amp;dn":"The+Walk+2015+FIRST+CAM+x264+Mic-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e092673a30dddd3f18d703516cb4337216ac67b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,9,38,115,163,13,221,211,241,141,112,53,22,203,67,55,33,106,198,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
