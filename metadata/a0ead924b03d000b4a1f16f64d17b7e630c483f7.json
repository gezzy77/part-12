I'm fairly certain it is the Ocean Shores LD Ive made this recode from.\n  In fact the Ocean Shores logo pops up a few times but it lasts only seconds. The only releases I know of are the Ocean Shores LD and the Tai Seng VHS (and now wider VCD).  The LD to DVD transfer isn't perfect but it's more than watchable.  There is a trailer for Brief Encounter after the end credits.  \n\nIMDb Information.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095937/\nIMDb Rating..........: 7.2\nRottenTomatoes.......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1032450-painted_faces/\nRT Rating............: 100%\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEncoding/Bitrate Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFile size                                : 875 MiB\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 067 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L4\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 8 frames\nBit rate                                 : 964 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 704 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 15.437 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 31.458 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2479 dd79a61\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 96.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nTitle                                    : Stereo / Stereo\nLanguage                                 : English\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFilename          : Painted Faces [1988]x264LDrip(AsianClassics).mp4\nMD5               : b9066597983076f6fe176743d64d648e\nSHA-256           : 63a525dec205ef037d65bafbe106b72f1e10aa08c2cbc5070647c05a656a1967\nFile Size         : 917,532,815\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReviews/Synopsis\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease go to the following website for detailed information:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_Faces&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_Faces&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI first saw this movie at a film festival some years ago. Jackie Chan came personally to share some of his favorite films. I so enjoyed this movie that I have never forgotten its impact on me.\n Knowing that the story is based on the true-life experiences of Jackie and his friends as children under the care and discipline of the Chinese Opera makes it even more exciting to watch. The movie is full of acrobatics, make-up, and wonder.\n It's an intimate portrait of the life of these children and the world they lived, worked, and grew up in.\nThis film has a depth of character and humility that is all too often not found in todays movies. The performances are endearing all around. Even though Sammo Hung's character is a severe taskmaster, you cannot help feeling for him by the end of the film.\n And the children are a delight from the start. The martial arts sequences are masterfully executed. Moreover, the non-combbative focus of the choreography makes it a great choice for those who may be turned off by more hard core action.\n A good date film, although perhaps a step below Jackie Chan's Canton and Lady Rose in that department.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/3XHBzWd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/3XHBzWd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjackers, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
