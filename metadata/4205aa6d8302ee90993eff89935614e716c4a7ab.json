Emilia Pisani of Simon &amp; Schuster (judge) says &quot;Great southern flavor!&quot; and &quot;Jack is an alluring leading man!&quot;\n\nAn orphaned, small-town, southern girl, held hostage by responsibility and self-doubt.\n\nA Hollywood A-list mega-star, on the run from his latest scandal and with everything to lose. \n\nA chance encounter that leads to an unlikely arrangement and epic love affair that will change them both forever. \n\nWhen his co-star and real-life girlfriend is caught cheating on him with her married and much older director, A-list hottie, Jack Eversea, finds himself in sleepy Butler Cove, South Carolina. Jack hopes the sultry southern heat in this tiny coastal Lowcountry town will hide him not only from the tabloids and his cheating girlfriend, but his increasingly vapid life and the people who run it. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on meeting Keri Ann Butler. \n\nKeri Ann has relied on herself so long, dealing with her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death and the responsibilities of keeping up her family's historic mansion, that boys and certainly the meager offering of eligible boys in Butler Cove, have never figured into her equation. But fate has other plans. Suddenly face to face with the man who played the movie role of her favorite fictional character, Jack has Keri Ann yearning for everything she has previously avoided ... and Jack must decide whether this funny, sassy girl is worth changing his life for, before his mistakes catch up to him.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4205aa6d8302ee90993eff89935614e716c4a7ab","amp;dn":"Eversea+%28Eversea+%231%29+by+Natasha+Boyd+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4205aa6d8302ee90993eff89935614e716c4a7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,5,170,109,131,2,238,144,153,62,255,137,147,86,20,231,22,196,167,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
