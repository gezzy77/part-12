Through late 2006, it is Seger's best-selling album in the U.S., certified 8-times platinum.\n\nAmazon.com\nBob Seger has racked up a lot of worthy tracks over the years, but it took until 1994 for a greatest hits package to appear. VoilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â . The bad news: We're missing an awful lot of songs here. Night Moves is Seger's crit-pick album, and a great place to start if you don't have any Seger at all. Next in the rankings is Stranger in Town. Otherwise, his highs are pretty scattered, which would make any best-of package a worthy investment. But if you want to get comprehensive, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Never Forgets,&quot; &quot;Fire Down Below,&quot; &quot;Horizontal Bop,&quot; &quot;Her Strut,&quot; &quot;Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Katmandu&quot; aren't on this CD--and you'll have to go to the original albums to secure them. --Gavin McNett\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Roll Me Away\n[02] Night Moves\n[03] Turn The Page\n[04] You'll Accomp'ny Me\n[05] Hollywood Nights\n[06] Still The Same\n[07] Old Time Rock &amp; Roll\n[08] We've Got Tonight\n[09] Against The Wind\n[10] Mainstreet\n[11] The Fire Inside\n[12] Like A Rock\n[13] C'est La Vie\n[14] In Your Time\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:02m:33s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 155mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi \n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 25 October 1994\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Capitol Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.bobseger.com \n\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Bob+Seger \n\t\t\t \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9a0a67f74bb78ae8387d21b87f6f2520036d80","amp;dn":"%5B1994%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Bob+Seger+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9a0a67f74bb78ae8387d21b87f6f2520036d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,154,10,103,247,75,183,138,232,56,125,33,184,127,111,37,32,3,109,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
