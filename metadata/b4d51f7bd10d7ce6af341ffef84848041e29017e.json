You'll progress from a complete beginner regarding Arduino programming and electronics knowledge to intermediate skills and the confidence to create your own amazing Arduino projects. Absolutely no experience in programming or electronics required!\nRather than requiring you to wade through pages of theory before you start making things, this book has a handson approach. You will dive into making projects right from the start, learning how to use various electronic components and how to program the Arduino to control or communicate with those components.\nEach project is designed to build upon the knowledge learned in earlier projects and to further your knowledge in programming as well as skills with electronics. By the end of the book you will be able create your own projects confidently and with creativity.\n\nWhat you'll learn\nUsing a proven teaching style with clear breadboard diagrams, full code listings, and simple step-by-step instructions, you will learn fun things such as:\nControlling LEDs\nDisplaying text and graphics on LCD displays\nMaking a line-following robot\nUsing touch screens\nUsing digital pressure sensors\nReading and writing data to SD cards\nConnecting your Arduino to the Internet\nWho this book is for\nElectronics enthusiasts who are new to the Arduino as well as artists and hobbyists who want to learn this very popular platform for physical computing and electronic art.\n\nTitle: Beginning Arduino\nPublisher: Apress\nAuthor: Michael McRoberts\nYear: 2010\nFormat: PDF\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
