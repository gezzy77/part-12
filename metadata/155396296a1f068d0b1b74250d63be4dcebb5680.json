There was some duplication of tracks, such as the drum track on the first What Is Life and Beware Of Darkness, so I removed most of the duplicates to fit everything on 4 discs. The different versions of each song do not sync up, you&amp;#039;d have to do that manually. \n\nMaybe a poor substitute for having the actual multitracks, but better than nothing. \n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1\n\nWhat Is Life #1\n1. acoustic guitar  2. lead guitar\nWhat Is Life #2\n3. 2nd lead guitar  4. drums  5. piano + lead guitar\nBeware Of Darkness #1\n6. lead vocal  7. acoustic + vibes  8. drums\nBeware Of Darkness #2 \n9. lead guitar + vocal\nBeware Of Darkness #3 \n10. piano + acoustic + vibes 11. guitar + drums\nHear Me Lord #1\n12. lead guitar + lead vocal  13. drums  14. organ\n\nDisc 2\n\nLet It Down #1 \n1. bass  2. drums  3. guitar\nLet It Down #2 \n4. vocals + bass\nLet It Down #3 \n5. backing vocals + vocal  6. piano  7. organ\nAwaiting On You All #1\n8. bass  9. drums + slide guitar  10. guitars\nAwaiting On You All #2 \n11. bass + slide guitar  12. more guitars  13. piano\nAwaiting On You All #3 \n14. bass  15. horns + percussion  16. guitars + piano\n\nDisc 3\n\nRun Of The Mill #1 \n1. guitar + guide vocal  2. guitars  3. drums\nRun Of The Mill #2\n4. lead vocal  5. harmonium  6. piano\nArt Of Dying #1\n7. bass + drums  8. rhythm guitars  9. lead guitar\nArt Of Dying #2\n10. piano + organ\nWhat Is Life #3\n11. guitar  12. horns\nBeware Of Darkness #4\n13. instruments  14. strings  15. vocal + guitars\nHear Me Lord #2\n16. vocal + guitar  17. piano  18. organ\n\nDisc 4\n\nYou\n1. lead vocal  2. guitar  3. bass\nLet It Down #4 \n4. vocals  5. lead guitar + horns  6. organ + guitar\nRun Of The Mill #3 \n7. lead vocal  8. horns + acoustic  9. piano + harmonium\nArt Of Dying #3\n10. piano + organ + drums  11. horns  12. horn\nApple Scruffs #1 \n13. vocals + harmonica  14. acoustic  15. percussion\nApple Scruffs #2\n16. vocals + 2nd lead guitar\nApple Scruffs #3  \n17. vocals + harmonica + guitar  18. bvs  19. bvs\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:155396296a1f068d0b1b74250d63be4dcebb5680","amp;dn":"George+Harrison+-+The+Making+Of+All+Things+Must+Pass+Isolated+Tr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"155396296a1f068d0b1b74250d63be4dcebb5680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,83,150,41,106,31,6,141,11,27,116,37,13,99,190,77,206,187,86,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
