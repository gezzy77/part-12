The tracks here are all full-length, and make for an interesting profile of the band. Also included is a 1992 &quot;family tree&quot; by Pete Frame, who's published many of these, charting the various roots and branches of the band members. As with any compilation, some will critize the choice made: we are &quot;Tank&quot;, &quot;Watching Over You&quot;, &quot;I Believe In Father Christmas&quot; and &quot;Paper Blood&quot; you ask? Well, then you'll need the 4-disc compilation &quot;The Return Of The Manticore&quot;. There's only so much stuff you can fit on 2 discs, and these are crammed with some of their best.\nAmazon Review By eveoflove on April 21, 2001\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] The Barbarian\n[02] Take A Pebble\n[03] Knife Edge\n[04] Lucky Man\n[05] Tarkus\n[06] Jeremy Bender\n[07] The Sheriff\n[08] Nutrocker\n[09] Living Sin\n[10] The Endless Enigma\n\nPlay Time - 01h:06m:28s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] From The Beginning\n[02] Hoedown\n[03] Trilogy\n[04] Jerusalem\n[05] Still...You Turn Me On\n[06] Karn Evil 9 - 1st Impression, Part 2\n[07] Fanfare For The Common Man\n[08] C'est La Vie\n[09] Pirates\n[10] Brain Salad Surgery\n[11] Honky Tonk Train Blues\n[12] Love Beach\n[13] Black Moon\n[14] Affairs Of The Heart\n\nPlay Time - 01h:14m:30s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:20m:59s\nTotal File Size....................... 337mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
