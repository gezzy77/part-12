He loves telling tall tales and always brags about himself. According to him, he was picked up by a human couple who owns a diner while he was drifting around on an iceberg. \n\nThough he has lost all contact with his Canadian family, he has discovered a new home in serving the diners' clientele, thanks to the kind couple. His cafÃƒÂ© is an embodiment of his personality. The place is always packed with many regulars, animals and humans, who are drawn by his charismatic magnetism. \n\n\n\nRelease date       : April 12, 2012\n\n\nAudio language     : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language  : English\n\n\nStatus             : Currently Airing\n\n\nProducers          : Studio Pierrot\n\n\nGenres             : Comedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09de0ddea6e7b338e2316df4b966e3bafcc0c30","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Polar+Bear+Cafe+-+02+%5B720p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09de0ddea6e7b338e2316df4b966e3bafcc0c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,157,224,221,234,110,123,51,142,35,22,223,75,150,110,59,175,204,12,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
