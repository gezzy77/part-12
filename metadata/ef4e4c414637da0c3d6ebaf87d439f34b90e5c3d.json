His solo hits include &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; and &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;. In 2008, he was ranked the 87th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nHenley has also played a founding role in several environmental and political causes, most notably the Walden Woods Project. Since 1994, he has divided his musical activities between the Eagles and his solo career. He is known for his rusty, raw voice that is instantly recognizable. Henley also has a wide vocal range displayed in Eagles songs such as &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; and &quot;Sad Cafe&quot;.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Eagles, Henley embarked on a productive solo career, the most commercially successful of any of the Eagles. His first solo release, 1982's I Can't Stand Still, was a moderate seller. The single &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, a denunciation of tabloid media, was Henley's all-time biggest hit. It reached #3 on Billboard's Hot 100 at the beginning of 1983 and earned a Gold-certified single for sales of over a million copies in the US. It was also nominated for a Grammy. Henley and his erstwhile lover, Stevie Nicks, had duetted on her Top 10 Pop and Ault Contemporary hit &quot;Leather and Lace&quot; a year earlier. Henley also contributed &quot;Love Rules&quot; to the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack.\n\nThis was followed in 1984 by Building the Perfect Beast, which featured layered synthesizers and was a marked departure from the Eagles' country-rock sound. A single release, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's haunting rhythms and lyrics of loss and aging, capped by seeing &quot;a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac,&quot; immediately connected with a certain age group. The music video for the song was a striking, evocative, black-and-white, French New Wave-influenced montage directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino that won several MTV Video Music Awards including Best Video of the Year. Henley also won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song. Several other songs on the album, &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot; (No. 9 on Hot 100), &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot; (#34) and &quot;Sunset Grill&quot; (#22) also received considerable airplay.\n\nHenley's next album, 1989's The End of the Innocence, was even more successful. The song &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, a collaboration with Bruce Hornsby, is a melancholy, piano-driven tale of finding bits of happiness in a corrupt world, and reached No. 8 as a single. The hit follow-up, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, is an emotive chance remembrance of a lost love. Both songs use the effective technique of varying the words in the chorus each time it is sung, to advance the song's narrative. The album's &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; and &quot;New York Minute&quot; were among other songs that gained radio airplay. Henley again won the Best Male Rock Vocal Performance Grammy in 1990 for the album. Also in 1989, Henley made a brief appearance on MTV's Unplugged series.\n\nIn live shows, Henley would play drums and sing simultaneously only on certain Eagles songs; on his solo songs he would either play electric guitar and sing or just sing. Occasionally Eagles songs would get drastic rearrangements, such as &quot;Hotel California&quot; with four trombones.\n\nA long period without a new recording followed, as Henley waited out a dispute with his record company[citation needed] while also participating in a 1994 Eagles reunion tour and live album. During the hiatus, Henley recorded a cover of &quot;Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat&quot; for the film Leap of Faith, provided background vocals for country star Trisha Yearwood's hit single &quot;Walkaway Joe&quot;, and duetted with Patty Smyth on &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough&quot; and Roger Waters on &quot;Watching TV&quot; on Waters' Amused to Death album, in 1992. Henley provided the voice of Henry Faust in Media:Randy Newman's Faust a 1993 musical which was released on compact disc that year.\n\nIn 2000, after 11 years Henley released another solo studio recording, Inside Job, containing the lead single &quot;Taking You Home&quot;. He performed songs from the album in a VH1 Storytellers episode in 2000. In 2002 a live DVD entitled Don Henley: Live Inside Job was released. In 2005 Don opened 10 of Stevie Nicks concerts on her Two Voices Tour.\n\nHenley's most recent recording appearances include a duet with Kenny Rogers on Rogers' 2006 release Water &amp; Bridges titled &quot;Calling Me&quot; and on Reba McEntire's 2007 album, Reba: Duets, performing &quot;Break Each Other's Hearts Again&quot;.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with CNN, while discussing the future of the Eagles, Henley indicated he still has plans for more records: &quot;But we all have some solo plans still. I still have a contract with a major label [Warner] for a couple of solo albums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActual Miles 1995 \n\n\nActual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album by American singer/songwriter Don Henley, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; (Henley, Danny Kortchmar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:36\n2.\t&quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; (Mike Campbell, Henley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n3.\t&quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot; (Kortchmar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n4.\t&quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot; (Henley, Kortchmar, Benmont Tench) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n5.\t&quot;Sunset Grill&quot; (Henley, Kortchmar, Tench) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n6.\t&quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; (Henley, Bruce Hornsby) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n7.\t&quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; (John Corey, Henley, Stan Lynch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:05\n8.\t&quot;New York Minute&quot; (Henley, Kortchmar, Jai Winding) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:34\n9.\t&quot;I Will Not Go Quietly&quot; (Henley, Kortchmar) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:41\n10.\t&quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (Campbell, Henley, J.D.
