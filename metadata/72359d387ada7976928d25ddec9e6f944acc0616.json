He has been one of the world's premier electronic composers and performers for decades. During that time, he has created some of the most memorable music in the new age community. His output has been both prolific and consistent. It is difficult to review his albums because they only compare to each other. Tenku is a brilliantly lyrical yet entirely instrumental CD. Kitaro speaks volumes with his synthesizers. These romantic interludes are full of gentle melodies and lush synth washes. The atmospheres are vibrant and bold. They are connected by wispy drones. There are no dark overtones or edges; this is upbeat, pastoral ambience. There are few similar artists, but fans of Vangelis, Suzanne Ciani, Constance Demby, and Dean Evenson are likely to enjoy Kitaro's music as well.\n~Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide\n\nThe title, which means &quot;heavenly sky&quot;, reflects the open air environment of Kitaro's home studio. On the opening track, a child's laughter is heard. The album's theme concerns images and impressions of childhood.\n\n&quot;I send a message of sound toward the sky, engulfing empty space, soaring far beyond grasp, high above the mountain tops, beyond ocean waves, stretching to reach the Andes and lightly touching Nepal . . . now catch the sound and feel the light by feeling things which are with life . . . this is a beginning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ connecting the dream to the color of your breathless heart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ peace and tranquility, you need only to sing . . . it is for you&quot; --Kitaro\n\n\nDiscogs &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Kitaro-Tenku/release/2545763&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Kitaro-Tenku/release/2545763&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72359d387ada7976928d25ddec9e6f944acc0616","amp;dn":"Kitaro+-+Tenku+%5B1986%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72359d387ada7976928d25ddec9e6f944acc0616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,53,157,56,122,218,121,118,146,141,37,221,236,158,111,148,74,204,6,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
