It has changed our lives so much that \n\nwe bought 10 copies and gave them away to family members. We are getting ready to purchase 10 more to give away \n\nto our friends. - Devin and Glenda in Alaska\nPublisher's Notes\n\nThe success stories speak for themselves in this latest book from money maestro Dave Ramsey. Instead of \n\npromising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing \n\nnot only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial \n\nhealth.\n\nRamsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) \n\nand attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but \n\noverspending and massive amounts of debt. &quot;Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses,&quot; Ramsey declares in \n\nhis typically candid style. &quot;They're broke!&quot;\n\nAnd this isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to \n\nthe heart of the money problems: You.\n\n- Thomas Nelson Publishers\n\n\nI got the original FLAC version of this and converted it to MP3 for easier download.\n\nThanks to hgate73 for the original FLACs!!\n\n---japo32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f7481277b472b3a969a9703af58eb1d8733626","amp;dn":"The+Total+Money+Makeover+___japo32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f7481277b472b3a969a9703af58eb1d8733626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,247,72,18,119,180,114,179,169,105,169,112,58,245,142,177,216,115,54,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
