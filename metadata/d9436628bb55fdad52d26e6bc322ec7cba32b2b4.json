Muddy Waters once sang, &quot;The blues had a baby and they named the baby rock &amp; roll.&quot; This is the album that proves it. Instrumental versions of R&amp;B hits (&quot;Memphis,&quot; &quot;Susie Q,&quot; &quot;The Bounce&quot;) rebound against heartfelt soul numbers (&quot;Farther Down the Road,&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;) right next to dazzling fretboard blues romps both slow and fast (&quot;Wham!,&quot; &quot;Down and Out&quot;). Mack sings his rear end off, the band -- with saxes and Hammond organ and pumping soul bass -- is right in there and Mack's vibrato-drenched guitar stings, wounds, and amazes. It remains his defining moment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9436628bb55fdad52d26e6bc322ec7cba32b2b4","amp;dn":"Lonnie+Mack+-+The+Wham+Of+That+Memphis+Man%21+%281964%29+MP3%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9436628bb55fdad52d26e6bc322ec7cba32b2b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,67,102,40,187,85,253,173,82,210,110,107,195,34,236,124,186,50,178,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
