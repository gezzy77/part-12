The acting was superb, the story content held you in your seat, and the confused love merry-go-round tells you what real life is all about. If it can\\&amp;#039;t bring fear and tears to your eyes, then i suggest you continue watching reality shows. I do know I will search out these actors and try to see their other accomplishments. They are a team to be reckoned with. Go to your blockbusters, or favorite video store and pick up a copy. Prepare yourself for entertainment; invite a date and get the popcorn ready. Oh, and don\\&amp;#039;t forget the rag to wipe the butter off the fingers and the drops from your eyes.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233911/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233911/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02a9cf88f4a652d1c393d4e45b5fe815f3ccecd3","amp;dn":"Ice.Men.2004.DVDRip.XViD-TWiST.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02a9cf88f4a652d1c393d4e45b5fe815f3ccecd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,169,207,136,244,166,82,209,195,147,212,228,91,95,232,21,243,204,236,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
