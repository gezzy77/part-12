Flexible partitioning and management of hard drives\nOne solution for a wide variety of traditional data maintenance tasks\nParagon Connect VD - Exclusive technology for direct partitioning of virtual hard drives\nAll operations are alignment aware and can be performed on AFD of any capacity\nFull Windows 8.1 support\n \n \nDisk Management for Virtual Hard Drives\nRe-partition your virtual hard drives without booting your virtual machine. With Paragon Partition Manager Professional you can easily connect your virtual storage to our software and perform all major partitioning operations. The non-destructive connection of a virtual disk allows complete safety and minimal downtime during complex re-partitioning operations since all changes are saved to a snapshot.\n\nUse Windows XP with 2TB+ Hard Disks\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s common knowledge that drives with capacities beyond 2TB are out of the supported size range for the popular Windows XP system. We can help you augment Windows XP by adding support for GPT (GUID Partition Table) disks, enabling you to use all the disk space on ultra high capacity drives.\nBoot Management for your flexibility\nIf you need to install a second operating system on your Windows PC, you can allocate some space to create a new partition with Paragon Partition Manager by taking the unallocated on-disk space or the unused space of other partitions if necessary. Then format the newly created partition to a particular file system, check its surface for bad sectors to avoid possible data loss, and finally reboot the computer to launch the installation procedure. With Paragon's Boot Manager you can now easily manage several operating systems.\nEasily Split Your Partitions\nIf you neglected to create two different partitions for your music and your videos in the past, you can now simply split your multimedia partition into two. Just select a partition, then the files and folders youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to move to the new partition, and finally redistribute free space between the two partitions (if necessary), and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re done!\nMore Space on Ã¢â‚¬Å“C:Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Without Reboot\nAfter installing a number of resource-consuming applications and system updates, your system partition (NTFS formatted) may have started to suffer from a lack of free space. If your adjacent data partition has plenty of redundant space, you can enlarge an NTFS partition (system, locked) with Paragon Partition Manager Professional without rebooting Windows and interrupting your work.\nComprehensive File System Support\nThanks to Paragon's exclusive Universal File System Driver (UFSD) technology, Paragon Partition Manager gives you the option to browse and modify partitions of the most of file systems, including hidden and unmounted partitions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-professional/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-professional/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce055d74cee267b2ab31ad2b1ebef01846ceef7","amp;dn":"Paragon+Partition+Manager+15+Professional+10.1.25.377.000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce055d74cee267b2ab31ad2b1ebef01846ceef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,224,85,215,76,238,38,123,42,179,26,210,177,235,239,1,132,108,238,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
