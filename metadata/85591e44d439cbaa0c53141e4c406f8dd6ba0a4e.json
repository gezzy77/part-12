This is the original Bob James -- his very first album, in fact, recorded at age 22 (and produced by Quincy Jones) as a prize for winning the 1962 Collegiate Jazz Festival.  Not only did the trio win as a unit, but each member won as most promising player on his own instrument (James also won as leader).  This collection, largely bop in its approach, is astonishing in its precocious reach, featuring two James originals: the intriguing &quot;Quest&quot; and the daringly impressionistic &quot;Trilogy&quot; that involves the playing of oil drums, temple blocks, and golf balls, among other things.  The trio acquits itself well with the varied, ambitious material, including an ethereal &quot;Nardis,&quot; a selection from Leonard Bernstein's ballet, Candide, and a churning rendition of &quot;Birk's Works.&quot; The only ballad is a confident, sensitive treatment of &quot;Fly Me to the Moon.&quot; The CD also includes two bonus tracks, &quot;Softly As in a Morning Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot;; it's unclear whether they were part of the original session, but they are equally playful and joyous. Impressive trio work, great spirit. ~ Judith Schlesinger, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nBob James (Piano) \nRon Brooks (Double Bass) \nBob Pozar (Drums) \n\nBob James Trio - Bold Conceptions Tracks:\n01  A Moment's Notice (Ernie Wilkins) 3:09 \n02  Nardis (Miles Davis) 5:30 \n03  The Night We Called it a Day (Matt Dennis/Tom Adair) 3:10 \n04  Trilogy (Bob James) 6:42\n05  Quest (Bob James) 4:10 \n06  My Love (from Candide) (Leonard Bernstein) 5:14 \n07  Fly Me to the Moon (aka in Other Words) (Bart Howard) 4:43 \n08  Birks' Works (Dizzy Gillespie) 4:36 \n09  Softly as in a Morning Sunrise (Sigmund Romberg/Oscar Hammertstein III) 3:39 \n10  Ghost Riders in the Sky (Stan Jones) 3:28 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85591e44d439cbaa0c53141e4c406f8dd6ba0a4e","amp;dn":"Bob+James+Trio+-+Bold+Conceptions+%281962%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85591e44d439cbaa0c53141e4c406f8dd6ba0a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,89,30,68,212,57,203,170,12,83,20,30,76,64,111,141,214,186,10,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
