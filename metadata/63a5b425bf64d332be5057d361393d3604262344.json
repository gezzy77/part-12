Its central character, played by David Bowie, is a World War I-era Prussian aristocrat. Living by his wits throughout Europe, Bowie uses his sexual prowess with beautiful women (and powerful men) to advance himself. The leering lothario eventually comes to grief in the decadent Berlin of the 1920s. We don&amp;#039;t know how he did it, but director David Hemmings managed to corral some of the most stellar sex goddesses in film history to play cameos in Just a Gigolo: Kim Novak, Maria Schell, and even Marlene Dietrich. The film was originally released as SchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ner Gigolo, Armer Gigolo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a5b425bf64d332be5057d361393d3604262344","amp;dn":"David+Hemmings+-+Just+a+Gigolo+%28Sch%C3%B6ner+Gigolo%2C+armer+Gigolo%29+%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a5b425bf64d332be5057d361393d3604262344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,165,180,37,191,100,211,50,190,80,87,211,97,57,61,54,4,38,35,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
