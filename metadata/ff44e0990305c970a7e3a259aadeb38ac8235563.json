Using MoschosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings as his guide and inspiration, the acclaimed travel writer William Dalrymple retraces the footsteps of these two monks, providing along the way a moving elegy to the slowly dying civilization of Eastern Christianity and to the people who are struggling to keep its flame alive. The result is DalrympleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurpassed masterpiece: a beautifully written travelogue, at once rich and scholarly, moving and courageous, overflowing with vivid characters and hugely topical insights into the history, spirituality and the fractured politics of the Middle East.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff44e0990305c970a7e3a259aadeb38ac8235563","amp;dn":"From+the+Holy+Mountain+A+Journey+Among+the+Christians+of+the+Mid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff44e0990305c970a7e3a259aadeb38ac8235563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,68,224,153,3,5,201,112,167,227,162,89,170,222,179,138,200,35,85,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
