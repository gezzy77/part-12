There is also a large section on cardiac procedures which would be useful to the trainee and in fact covers the essential detail more clearly than some larger textbooks.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ BMA Medical Book Award reviewer, 2013 BMA Medical Book Awards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5892cef7eb9b3f391d6cef4181f1285aee130e6d","amp;dn":"Manual+of+Cardiovascular+Medicine%2C+4E-+Griffin+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5892cef7eb9b3f391d6cef4181f1285aee130e6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,146,206,247,235,155,63,57,29,108,239,65,129,241,40,90,238,19,14,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
