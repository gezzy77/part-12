Rudko\nAnyone who listened to top-40 radio in the 60's has to remember the first time they heard &quot;California Dreamin'&quot;. The haunting lyrics and the tight, clear harmonies had a folkish sound that was clearly ahead of its time. When their music finally became available on CD, the textures became more apparent and the true artistic content was more clearly defined. On this disc, which was carefully remastered from the original analog tapes, the Mamas and the Papas are finally heard at their best. While there was clearly not enough room for all their great songs, all of their major hits are included, including my favorite, &quot;I Saw Her Again&quot;... complete with Denny's goof that became a feature of the song. The voices are clearer and lyrics more understandable, and the instrumental backup, which was somewhat unconventional in itself, is clearer as well. Being the fan that I was since the first hearing, I have to rate this 5 stars... a real winner in both music and technical quality.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMamas &amp; the Papas, The - Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Mamas &amp; the Papas, The\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998 03 10\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 253kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
