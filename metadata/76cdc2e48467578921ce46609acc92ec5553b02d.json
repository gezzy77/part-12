The compilation album is the band's second greatest hits package. It was released 23 years after the first greatest hits package in 1988.\n\n\n Designed as a companion piece to the original Journey Greatest Hits -- a compilation released some 23 years earlier in 1988 and reissued on vinyl the same week this sequel arrived in 2011 -- Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 collects the singles, album rock hits, and album tracks that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it onto the first hits disc. This doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave too many familiar tunes for Greatest Hits, Vol. 2: the charting hits here are Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stone in Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Still They Ride,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“After the Fall,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The PartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Over (Hopelessly in Love),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suzanne,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walks Like a Lady,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first of which is a Journey classic that likely should have been on the first Greatest Hits, but apart from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Still They Ride,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the rest are the kind of second-tier singles recognized only by listeners already somewhat dedicated. This says nothing about the quality of the songs -- they are the kinds of tunes that make for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“more of the bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ compilation, songs reminiscent of other hits but just not quite as immediate or epic, not as memorable for one reason or another -- but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not really anything to entice a listener outside of the notion of completeness. And for those who do believe in completeness and yet didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spring for 2001Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s double-disc The Essential Journey and so are in need of a companion to that 1988 collection, this serves nicely.
