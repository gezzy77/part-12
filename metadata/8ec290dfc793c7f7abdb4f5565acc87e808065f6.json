Optimizing systematically flux and condensate confinement in various nanostructured superconductors, ranging from single nano-cells to their huge arrays, critical fields and currents can be increased up to their theoretical limits, thus drastically improving the potential for practical applications of nanostructured superconductors.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 320 pages\n# Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Company; 1 edition (March 28, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9814343919\n# ISBN-13: 978-9814343916","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec290dfc793c7f7abdb4f5565acc87e808065f6","amp;dn":"Nanostructured+Superconductors+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec290dfc793c7f7abdb4f5565acc87e808065f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,194,144,223,199,147,199,247,171,219,79,85,101,172,200,126,128,128,101,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
