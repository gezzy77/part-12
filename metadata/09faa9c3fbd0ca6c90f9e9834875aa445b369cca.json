This book tells the story of liquid crystals, from their controversial discovery at the end of the nineteenth century, to their eventual acceptance as another state of matter to rank alongside gases, liquids and solids. As their story unfolds, the scientists involved and their works are put into illuminating broader socio-political contexts. In recent years, liquid crystals have had a major impact on the display industry, culminating in the now widely available flat-screen televisions; this development is described in detail over three chapters, and the basic science behind it is explained in simple terms accessible to a general reader. New applications of liquid crystals in materials, bio-systems, medicine and technology are also explained","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09faa9c3fbd0ca6c90f9e9834875aa445b369cca","amp;dn":"Soap%2C+Science%2C+and+Flat-Screen+TVs%3A+A+History+of+Liquid+Crystals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09faa9c3fbd0ca6c90f9e9834875aa445b369cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,250,169,195,251,208,202,108,144,249,233,131,72,117,170,68,91,54,156,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
