The veteran tenor Joe Henderson has had a distinctive sound and style of his own ever since he first entered the jazz major leagues yet he has spent long periods in relative obscurity before reaching his current status as a jazz superstar. As for the music on his &quot;comeback&quot; disc, it does deserve all of the hype. Henderson performs ten of Billy Strayhorn's most enduring compositions in a variety of settings ranging from a full quintet with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and duets with pianist Stephen Scott, bassist Christian McBride, and drummer Gregory Hutchinson to an unaccompanied solo exploration of &quot;Lush Life.&quot; This memorable outing succeeded both artistically and commercially and is highly recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Isfahan\n02 - Johnny Come Lately\n03 - Blood Count\n04 - Rain Check\n05 - Lotus Blossom\n06 - A Flower Is A Lovesome Thing\n07 - Take The 'A' Train\n08 - Drawing Room Blues\n09 - U.m.m.g (Upper Manhattan Medical Group)\n10 - Lush Life\n\nSplit with medieval.\nEnjoy and share!
