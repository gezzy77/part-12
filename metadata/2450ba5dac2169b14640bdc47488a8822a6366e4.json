The musicians are interviewed each extolling the superiority of his own instrument. The conductor arrives and the rehearsal begins. Being however displeased he shouts angrily at his orchestra making the musicians unwilling to follow his directions any further. After a short break he returns to find the oratorium a total chaos and the musicians in full revolt. An allegory about the contradictive nature of individual human character and the lack of harmony when each plays his own music oblivious of the man next to him.\n\nThere are some flaws(the picture goes blocky for an instant 3 or 4 times) in the video stream due to bad encoding in the original DVD but they don't affect overall quality much.\n\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?
