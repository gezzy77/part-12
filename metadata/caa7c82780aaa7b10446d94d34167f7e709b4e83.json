In this engaging lecture on two CDs, The late Howard Zinn shows why he was the foremost historian of political struggle, of social movements and the forgotten or suppressed parts of our history. \n\n\nHe tells stories of ordinary people who thrust themselves into history-making situations, and how civil rights, labor, anti-war and women's struggles became both the inspiration for, and the subjects of, his groundbreaking research and writing.
