Back in civilization, Boutenko was dismayed by the inferior quality of store-bought food and industrial agriculture, and began to regularly collect wild plants near his home and on his travels. Now, in Wild Edibles, he shares knowledge gleaned from years of live-food wildcrafting and thriving in harmony with nature.\nThis practical guide to plant foraging gives hikers, backpackers, raw foodists, gardeners, chefs, foodies, DIYers, survivalists, and off-the-grid enthusiasts the tools to identify, harvest, and prepare wild edible plants. The book outlines basic rules for safe wild-food foraging and discusses poisonous plants, plant identification protocol, gathering etiquette, and conservation.\nBoutenko explores in detail the many rewards of eating wild flora: environmental protection, sustainability, saving money, economic self-sufficiency, and healthy living. He draws on thoroughly researched nutrition science to make a compelling case for the health benefits of a diverse, local-food diet that includes wild greens.\nThe majority of the 60 edible plants described in this field guide can be found worldwide, including common-growing trees. Over 300 color photos make plant identification easy and safe. A chapter containing 67 high-nutrient vegan recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€including green smoothies, salads and salad dressings, spreads and crackers, main courses, juices, and sweetsÃ¢â‚¬â€provides inspiration to join Sergei on the trail to radiant health.\n\nAbout the Author\nAt age 15, Sergei Boutenko collaborated with his family on their first book, Raw Family: A True Story of Awakening; he and his sister Valya went on to coauthor Eating without Heating: Favorite Recipes from Teens Who Love Raw Food and Fresh: The Ultimate Live-Food Cookbook. Boutenko holds a degree in communications from Southern Oregon University. A writer and educational filmmaker, he conducts seminars on healthy living worldwide. The author lives in Ashland, OR.
