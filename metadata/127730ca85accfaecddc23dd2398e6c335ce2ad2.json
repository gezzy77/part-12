Lacking dignity, unity, and a clear image during the Republic, the urban image of Rome became focused only when the state came under the control of Augustus, the first emperor, who transformed the city physically and conceptually. Intervening in an ad hoc manner, he repaired existing public structures, added numerous new monuments, established municipal offices for urban care, and promoted an enduring aesthetic. Directed by a single vision, the cumulative results were forceful and unified. This book explores for the first time the motives for urban intervention, methods for implementation and the socio-political context of the Augustan period, as well as broader design issues such as formal urban strategies and definitions of urban imagery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:127730ca85accfaecddc23dd2398e6c335ce2ad2","amp;dn":"The+Urban+Image+of+Augustan+Rome+%28Architecture+History+Art+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"127730ca85accfaecddc23dd2398e6c335ce2ad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,119,48,202,133,172,207,174,205,220,35,221,35,152,230,195,53,206,42,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
