Multiple reality options let you tune the game to your liking. Improved control options, graphics, gameplay and more. There are three semi-dynamic campaigns set in Lebanon, Yemen, and Taiwan.\n\nTake control of two of the most devastating war machines ever created: American-made RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter and the Russian-made KA-52 Hokum. Always on the front lines of the most heated battles, this game will deploy you in hot spots and border disputes in Taiwan, Yemen, and Lebanon. This simulator features precise avionics, authentic weaponry, and options for both the grizzled sim veteran and the greenhorn alike. The game is designed to work with Enemy Engaged: Apache Havoc, allowing you to bring the Apache and Havoc gun ships into these missions and vice versa. Enemy Engaged: Comanche Vs. Hokum supports co-op and versus multiplayer sorties for up to 16 players via LAN, Internet, or serial connection.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90348d92161b9c1d5841a2d1f3025266d67bd8e","amp;dn":"Enemy+Engaged+-+RAH-66+Comanche+vs.+Ka-52+Hokum+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90348d92161b9c1d5841a2d1f3025266d67bd8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,3,72,217,33,97,185,193,213,132,26,45,31,48,37,38,109,103,189,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
