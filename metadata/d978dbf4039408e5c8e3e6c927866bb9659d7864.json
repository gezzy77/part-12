Their 1974 self-titled debut went platinum five times over and featured the smash hits, &quot;Can't Get Enough,&quot; (a Number One single) and &quot;Movin' On&quot; along with electrifying rock anthems like &quot;Ready For Love,&quot; &quot;Rock Steady&quot; and the title track.\n\n\n Bad Company's 1974 self-titled release stands as one of the most important and accomplished debut hard rock albums from the '70s. Though hardly visionary, it was one of the most successful steps in the continuing evolution of rock &amp; roll, riding on the coattails of achievement from artists like the Eagles and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. From the simple electric guitar lick on &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot; to the haunting bassline in &quot;Bad Company&quot; and the fast beats of &quot;Movin' On,&quot; Bad Company exemplified raw rock &amp; roll at its best. Erupting out of an experimental period created by the likes of Pink Floyd, Bad Company signified a return to more primal, stripped-down rock &amp; roll. Even while labelmates Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy and IV featured highly acclaimed, colorful album artwork, Bad Company's austere black and white record cover stood out in stark contrast. Six years later, AC/DC used the same idea on their smash Back in Black. Throughout the 35-minute album, Paul Rodgers' mesmerizing and gritty vocals hardly vary in tonal quality, offering a perfect complement to Mick Ralphs' blues-based guitar work. Several songs include three-chord verses offset by unembellished, distorted choruses, filled rich with Rodgers' cries. Bad Company is an essential addition to the rock &amp; roll library; clearly influential to '70s and '80s hard rock bands like Tom Petty, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Boston.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Can't Get Enough\n 02 - Rock Steady\n 03 - Ready For Love\n 04 - Don't Let Me Down\n 05 - Bad Company\n 06 - The Way I Choose\n 07 - Movin' On\n 08 - Seagull\n\nBad Company - Straight Shooter (1975/2015)\n FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/88,2 kHz | Time - 38:50 minutes | 847 MB\nStudio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Front cover\n\n Bad Company followed up their initial success with the 1975 release of the triple-platinum album Straight Shooter which contained the Top Ten smash ballad &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; which was Grammy nominated. Paul Rodgers stated, &quot;I started writing Ã¢â‚¬ËœFeel Like Makin LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when I was 18 and felt it needed an extra something. When I played it for Mick he added the big guitar bada ba bada ba then I felt the song was finished.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Other tracks from the album, such as &quot;Shooting Star&quot; have long since become concert and radio staples. Straight Shooter enjoyed international success, reaching number three on both the UK and US album charts. The ecstatic response to the album accelerated the group's momentum and their standing as one of the most popular concert attractions in the world.\n\n\n One year after Bad Company's multi-platinum self-titled debut, the British band returned to London to record a follow-up. Utilizing material written earlier in 1973, vocalist and songwriter Paul Rodgers wrote two acoustic-based rock ballads that would live on forever in the annals of great rock history. &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and the Grammy-nominated &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; helped Straight Shooter rise quickly through the charts to reach Billboard's number three spot both in the U.S. and U.K. However, critically and commercially the album never achieved the tremendous success of its predecessor, largely due to the lack of strong follow-up singles and supporting tracks. Simon Kirke stepped out from behind the drum-set to help produce and write &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Weep No More,&quot; two slower and less aggressive ballads indicative of the overall diminishing quality of the album. Following the release of Straight Shooter, Bad Company headlined their first North American tour.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Good Lovin' Gone Bad\n 02 - Feel Like Makin' Love\n 03 - Weep No More\n 04 - Shooting Star\n 05 - Deal With The Preacher\n 06 - Wild Fire Woman\n 07 - Anna\n 08 - Call On Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d978dbf4039408e5c8e3e6c927866bb9659d7864","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+Hdtracks+2015%5B24-88.2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d978dbf4039408e5c8e3e6c927866bb9659d7864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,120,219,244,3,148,8,229,200,227,230,201,39,134,107,185,101,157,120,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
