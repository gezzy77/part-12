I mean, I gotta tell ya true, the Spockster has sho nuf done it again with his own tricked up Beatles Ed Sullivan performances, circa 1964-5.\n\nThis DVD contains just the Fabs performances on the really beeg shew, complete in &quot;stereo,&quot; for the first time. (We could debate the point of &quot;stereo&quot; for TV tapes that were definately recorded and broadcast only in mono, but hey, what the hell.) Now the pointy eared devil MS did send me a long tech report on how he achieved a goodly improvement of video quality of these 40 year old tapes, as well as a very involved explanation of how the audio was restored. But all you really care about is how it looks, and sounds.\n\nSo suffice to say, if your home theatre system is equipped with Dolby Pro Logic II (DPLII), then you will be in an other galaxy when you cue up this baby, and hear the Fabs in some really good faux 5.1.\nIt seems to me that the final 1964 show, and the 1965 appearance, may sound a bit better than the first two shows, but you should decide for yourself as every system is different.\n\nTwo things come to mind when I watch this DVD.\n1/ How really kinda silly the Lads looked in that first show with their collar-less jackets, that I always thought were so kool. And what a dork Ed was.\n\n2/ Just how great the music and charisma of Fabs was, and continues to be.\nI love the final show, when John Lennon absolutely butchers the second verse of Help, but still carries on and finishes strong.\n\nPlus, if you just don't bother to designate a specific show on your DVD menu guide, instrumental Beatles music plays-live, stripped of vocals and outtake material, some of which I have never heard before- which is way cool, too. So, my overall recommendation to you Fabs fans out there, is to beam yourself up to where ever it is that Mirror Spock hangs out in the solar system, and get him to transpond you one of the DVDs, and get ready to feel like a kid again. And may God bless MS's pointy eared little head.&quot; -- Terry Ott\n\n&quot;When I first heard of Mirror Spock remastering the Beatles performances on the Ed Sullivan shows, I thought to myself why? I know some other collectors did too. What else needed to be done that the legit DVD collection didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already offer in terms of sound and visual presentation? I already had a clue as to the visual upgrade I could expect by noticing on the back cover of the DVD keepcase, that the screen captures taken from each show, looked extrodinarily clearer than IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever seen. This intrigued me. The disc does not have a paste job on it, rather it appears to be silk screened. Another clue for me as to the work and quality involved. The disc opens up with a beautiful menu that you can access any show, play all, or go to chapters. Works better than most legit pressed DVDs! We are given two choices for the audio: A remastered mono and a stereo presentation.\n\nFirst I choose the mono option and compared it to the legit DVDs. First off, the Mirror Spock plays louder and has more punch to it and is preferable to the legit DVDs mono. The stereo image he created works well enough to sense instrument and vocal seperation. Yes, it works. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like quasi stereo probablly, but it does bring out the performances to a different level hearing it sonically this way. It improves your enjoyment ten-fold.\n\nNow in regards to the visual quality, I did always think the legit DVDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looked fuzzy and not clear for something that was supposed to come from the master video tapes. It always disappointed me. As soon as you start viewing Mirror SpockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬â€-the jump in clarity stunned me! To me it looks as if he had access to the actual video masters and the legit DVDs now look as if they are old bootleg VHS quality. Sections where there was smear and ghostliness are basically cleaned up. The contrast from camera shot to camera shot is now consistant and scratches and distortions are fixed so that stretched aspect ratios are adjusted. In those cases you have what seems to be a smaller image on the screen with slight black lines on edges. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ok as those shots are now normal ratio. Mirror Spock did cut out the supporting acts and commercials and only Beatles content is left intact; some crossfades are needed to help with the transitions. I can live without the supporting acts and commercials as I have those on the legit DVDs. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great about this is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the Beatles performances. They look clearer and cleaner than anything IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever viewed before from these shows, and the sound is improved and just as good remastered in mono as well as in Mirror Spock stereo.\n\nDefinitely search this one out. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be disappointed and you will find it(like I do)to be an essential addition to your Beatles bootleg DVD collection and the one Ed Sullivan DVD you'll ever\nneed to enjoy those classic performances!&quot; -- Beatle Bob\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee26177b0956b515e9e0ac0da5fd2ebcabed7e9d","amp;dn":"Beatles+-+The+Ed+Sullivan+Shows+%28Mirror+Spock%29+%28best+version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee26177b0956b515e9e0ac0da5fd2ebcabed7e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,38,23,123,9,86,181,21,233,224,172,13,165,253,46,188,171,237,126,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
