Having pulled off the heist of a lifetime, Max looks forward to spending his remaining days relaxing with his beautiful young girlfriend. But when Riton (RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Dary), MaxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hapless partner and best friend, lets word of the loot slip to loose-lipped, two-timing Josy (Jeanne Moreau), Max is reluctantly drawn back into the underworld. A touchstone of the gangster-film genre, Touchez pas au grisbi is also pure BeckerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½understated, elegant, evocative.\n\nIncluded in this torrent\n# The Movie with external English subs\n# 2002 video interview with actor Daniel Cauchy\n# Excerpt from an episode of the French television series Cineastes de notre temps dedicated to Jacques Becker, featuring screenwriter Maurice Griffe, Grisbi author Albert Simonin, actor Lino Ventura, and FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Truffaut\n# 1972 interview excerpt with Lino Ventura\n# Clip from a 1978 interview with composer Jean Wiener\n# Theatrical trailer\n\nEssay\nJacques Becker may well be the most seriously underestimated director in the history of French cinema. Even in his own lifetime, he suffered disparaging comments. Wrote Jacques Demeure about Touchez pas au grisbi in a 1957 Positif article: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere we can measure the abyss that separates Becker from his master RenoirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. From Renoir, Becker has only derived certain narrative devices, such as a way of using doorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cor soon becomes the essential factor, and the film becomes simply decorative.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ True, things have improved since then. In 1998, a criticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ poll in the very same journal chose Grisbi as the finest French crime movie ever made. But despite the tributes of such figures as FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette, and Renoir himself at the time of BeckerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1960, it was more than thirty years before anyone thought to mount a complete retrospectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and even then it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t in France, but at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/8677/touchez5jh4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/8677/touchez5jh4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/7162/touchez3wv0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/7162/touchez3wv0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/2339/touchez4qx5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img324.imageshack.us/img324/2339/touchez4qx5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip------\n\n\tFile Name .............: Touchez pas au Grisbi.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,465,999,360 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:36:49 (139268 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 640x480 () [=] [=1.333]\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1434 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.195 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[N-VOP]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 80 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 42 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
