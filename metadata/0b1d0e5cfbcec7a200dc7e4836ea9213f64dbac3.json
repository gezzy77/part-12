The police want to write it off as an accident, or possibly a suicide, but superintendent Lars Johansson feels otherwise. Soon it is revealed that the young man was an American journalist, working on a project about his uncle, a CIA agent, who may have had ties to the highest reaches of Sweden's political community. Johansson's search for the truth will take him to New York and the FBI Academy in Virginia, and finally down into a dark web of international espionage, backroom politics, and greed, exposing the sheer incompetence that led to a devastating tragedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1d0e5cfbcec7a200dc7e4836ea9213f64dbac3","amp;dn":"Between+Summer%27s+Longing+and+Wi+-+Leif+G.W.+Persson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b1d0e5cfbcec7a200dc7e4836ea9213f64dbac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,29,14,92,251,206,199,162,0,220,126,72,54,234,146,19,246,77,186,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
