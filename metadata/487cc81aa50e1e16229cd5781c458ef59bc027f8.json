And while you might not think so when you look at your own cat slumped in front of the fire, they still share some fascinating character traits with their bigger wild cousins. From agility to territory marking to hunting, it's surprising how much our cats have retained. What's equally surprising is how some people relate to our bigger feline friends. Take Kevin Richardson, who looks after rescue lions in South Africa. &quot;They're super-friendly, super-nice,&quot; he says, cheerfully, as he's promptly wrestled to the ground by a hulking great lioness. But all the time he's watching their every move, and he's got some handy hints for gauging your own cat's state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Cute Response \r\nThe second episode; tells the story of how wild predators became such popular pets. Kittens trigger an emotional reaction in us. Their baby-like features make us want to nurture them. Its part of the reason we brought cats into our homes. Viewers will discover how the animal's amazing senses and mouse-catching prowess brought man and cat together ten thousand years ago. And how domestic cats are still evolving and will in the future become less wild, and more mild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/26/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fb/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d9/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/The-Story-of-Cats-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3143 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:487cc81aa50e1e16229cd5781c458ef59bc027f8","amp;dn":"ITV+The+Story+Of+Cats+Series+1+2of3+Cute+Response+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"487cc81aa50e1e16229cd5781c458ef59bc027f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,124,200,26,165,14,30,22,34,156,213,120,28,69,142,245,155,192,39,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
