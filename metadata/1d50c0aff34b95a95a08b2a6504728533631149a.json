The butcher has reemerged in American culture as an essential guide in avoiding the evils of industrial meatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which not only tastes bad, but is also bad for oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s health and for the environment. Joshua and Jessica Applestone, a former vegan and vegetarian, are trailblazers in this arena. They run FleisherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, an old-school butcher shop with a modern-day missionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sourcing and selling only grass-fed and organic meat. The ApplestonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ return to the nearly lost tradition of the buying and nose-to-tail carving of whole animalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all humanely raised close to their shop in New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hudson ValleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has helped to make them rising stars in the food world.\n           \nThe ButcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Well-Raised Meat is a compendium of their firsthand knowledge. This unique bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a guide, memoir, manifesto, and reference in oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shares everything one needs to know about well-raised meat, including why pastured meats are so much better than conventional ones and how to perfectly butcher and cook them at home. Readers will learn which cut of steak to look for as an alternative to the popular hanger (of which each steer has only one), how to host a driveway pig roast, and even how to break down an entire lamb (or just butterfly the shoulder)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all with accompanying step-by-step photographs. Differences among breeds and ideal cooking methods for various cuts and offal are covered, and the ApplestonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ decoding of misleading industry terminology and practices will help consumers make smarter, healthier purchases that can also help change whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wrong with meat in America today.\n           \nComplete with color and black-and-white photographs, illustrations, and more than a dozen recipes, The ButcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Well-Raised Meat is the definitive guide to eating great meatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½responsibly. \n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 240 pages\n# Publisher: Clarkson Potter (June 7, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0307716627\n# ISBN-13: 978-0307716620","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d50c0aff34b95a95a08b2a6504728533631149a","amp;dn":"The+Butcher+s+Guide+to+Well+Raised+Meat+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d50c0aff34b95a95a08b2a6504728533631149a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,80,192,175,243,75,149,169,90,8,178,166,80,71,40,83,54,49,20,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
