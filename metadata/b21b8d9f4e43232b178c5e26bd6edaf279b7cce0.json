Pagford is not what it first seems.\n\nAnd the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?\n\nA big novel about a small town, The Casual Vacancy is J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults. It is the work of a storyteller like no other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21b8d9f4e43232b178c5e26bd6edaf279b7cce0","amp;dn":"J.+K.+Rowling+-+The+Casual+Vacancy+%28ePub+mobi%29%5BSir.Fun%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21b8d9f4e43232b178c5e26bd6edaf279b7cce0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,27,141,159,78,67,35,43,23,140,94,38,189,110,218,242,121,183,204,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
