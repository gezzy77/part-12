Find an introduction to the relevant structures and functions exported by the kernel to userland, understand the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the Linux kernel and Unix derivatives, and gain a deeper understanding of the kernel. Learn how to reduce the vast amount of information contained in the kernel sources and obtain the skills necessary to understand the kernel sources.\n\nAs the Linux kernel constantly evolves, so must your understanding of the central functions of the kernel. Linux expert Wolfgang Mauerer focuses on version 2.6.24 (as well as summarizing changes to versions 2.6.25 and 2.6.26) of the kernel as he walks you through the concepts, underlying structures, and implementation of the Linux kernel. Keeping a close connection with the source codeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as the components and subsystems of the kernelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this book reviews the VFS layer and discusses virtual filesystems and the Extended filesystem family and examines how the page and buffer cache speed up kernel operations.\n\nYou'll take a look at the peculiarities of various architectures supported by the kernel, explore the assorted tools and means of working efficiently with the kernel sources, and investigate the numerous social aspects of kernel development and the Linux kernel community. Ultimately, this insightful book will serve as an indispensable step towards understanding structure and implementation of the Linux kernel.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\n* Various ways of viewing the kernelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as an enhanced machine, a resource manager, and a library\n* How the kernel handles all time-related requirements, both with low and high resolution\n* The mechanisms required to ensure proper operation of the kernel on multiprocessor systems\n* How modules add new functionality to the kernel\n* How the kernel deals with memory management, page reclaim, and swapping\n* How the kernel deals with networks and implements TCP/IP \n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for system programmers, administrators, developers of Linux-based solutions, and overall Linux enthusiasts. A solid foundation of C programming is required.
