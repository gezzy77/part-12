But the Ching General Wong pursues them there. Wong is a master of drunken boxing and to confront him Si Lin must learn the style from a Shaolin monk who once befriended Wong. Finally, Wong, tired of playing cat-and-mouse with the monks, assaults the Temple with his army in a pitched battle....&quot;\n\nThis movie is one of the first joseph kuo movies that he directed. And up until '7 Grandmasters', I thought he was digressing from this movie on. This is listed everywhere that it was made in 72. If this is true it was certainly the best movie around the time. Chinese connection is the only movie that could compare with this that is from that year.\n The fights in this movie are really intense. And while shen chan is not as good as jack long, I happen to like shen chan vs. mark long rather seeing brother vs. brother. Shen chan pulls out this backwards superman kick where he seems to elevate each one of his 3-4 kicks.\n There is so much power in this guy it is truly superhuman.\n\nThere are many other good martial artists in this, the end is a tad dissapointing, but only the VERY end, and hey, it's still a good scene.\n\nI would like to take the time here to comment on the life of shen chan. In case you didn't know, he is also from shaolin vs. lama. Well he died at the age of 44. This was in 1984, and it really pisses me off that we all know how bruce died, we all know of fu shen, but nobody ever mentions shen chan.\n Just like the hybrid (sheng chiang) of five deadly venoms, who died about 13 years ago, shen chan and all the other movie martial artists need to be recognized. I know that shen chan had spent some time in jail from brawling and he might not have been that good of a guy, but he deserves the same respect as bruce or fu sheng got.\n I sincerely hope that they start going over the lives of these great movie martial artists.\n\n**FLK never sold these AMRS projects which were limited to about 20 members (selfishness at its best). Enjoy it!  \n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Dec%202014/ShaolinTempleStrikesBack1981x264DVDripKungFump4_thumbs_20141210_195744_zpsde3b156f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Dec%202014/ShaolinTempleStrikesBack1981x264DVDripKungFump4_thumbs_20141210_195744_zpsde3b156f.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
