In breathtaking style the listener hears of the events that occur just before death and the events that come after it. The Imam gives a clear description about life in the grave, the horrors of the last day, the major and minor signs leading to the last hour and the day of resurrection. The Imam crowns this eloquently narrated lecture with the process of accountability and recompense. On the Day of Judgment those who pass the test will be rewarded with Paradise and those who fail will be rewarded with Hellfire. \n\nHereafter Vol1\n\nDetailed Desc is not available***********\n\nHereafter Vol2\n\nCD1  \n The Resurrection \nAssembly Land \nThe Horrors \nThe Dismantling of the Universe \n \nCD2  \n The non-believers on the Day of Judgment \nThe voiding of the deeds \nThe disputes of the Day of Judgment \nThe conversation between Allah and Jesus on the Day of Judgment \nThe disputes between the leaders and their followers \n \nCD3  \n The punishment for the sins of the believers \nThe righteous on the Day of Judgment \nThe seven who will be provided with shade on the Day of Judgment\n \nCD4  \n The righteous on the Day of Judgment (Continued):\nIntercession (Shafa&amp;#039;ah) \nThe seven who will be provided with shade on the Day of Judgment \nHow can one ease the pain of the Day of Judgment on one?s self? \nHow can one hide their sins from being made public on the Day of Judgment \nThe just on the Day of Judgment \nThe seven badges of honor given to the Shaheed \nThe ones who suppress their anger \nThe callers of Athan \nThe grey hair on the Day of Judgment \nWudhu on the Day of Judgment \n \nCD5  \n Names of the Hereafter \nRules of the Hereafter \nJustice \nIndividual accountability \nThe presentation of deeds \nThe multiplication of deeds \nThe witnesses on the Day of Judgment \nQuestioning and Interrogation \n \nCD6  \n Accountability \nBook of deeds \nSettlement of the accounts \nThe scale (al Mizan) \nThe pool (al Hawdh) \n \nCD7  \n Hellfire and its life (may Allah save us from it!) \nThe importance of the topic \nThe size of Hell \nThe heat of Hell \nHellfire sees, hears, and breaths \nHellfire is eternal \nThe food of the people of Hellfire \nThe clothing of the people of Hellfire \nThe various forms of punishment in Hellfire \n \nCD8  \n Some Actions that lead to Hellfire \nThe First to enter Paradise \nThe Gates of Paradise \nThe ones who enter Paradise before the Day of Judgment \n \nCD9  \n The Ratio of People in Hellfire compared to Paradise \nThe First Meal in Paradise \nA Tour of Paradise \nThe Levels of Paradise\n \nCD10  \n A Tour of Paradise (Continued) \nThe mansions of Paradise \nThe women of Paradise \nThe furniture in the mansions of Paradise \nThe servants of Paradise \nThe soil of Paradise \nThe rivers springs and fountains \nThe trees \nThe food \nIssues pertaining to the Muslim sisters \n \nCD11  \n Socialization in Paradise \nThe death of death \nThe greatest of the pleasures of Paradise \nThe people of Hellfire who will end up in Paradise \n \nCD12  \n The people of Paradise \nAre there more women than men in Paradise? \nChildren of the believers \nChildren of the nonbelievers \nParadise is not a payback for our deeds \nThe shape and age of the people of Paradise \nA comparison between Paradise and this world ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:834dccd341a741aec453c62326fd94e76d6cae75","amp;dn":"Islamic+Audiobook+-+The+HereAfter+by+Imam+Anwar+Al-Awlaki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"834dccd341a741aec453c62326fd94e76d6cae75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,77,204,211,65,167,65,174,196,83,198,35,38,253,148,231,109,108,174,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
