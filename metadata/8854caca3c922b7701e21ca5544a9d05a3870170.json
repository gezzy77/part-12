So, from what I can see, these 3 discs make up their studio discography and also included is the compilation album &quot;Long Days Ride 'Till Tomorrow.\n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\nEric's Trip is a Canadian indie rock band from Moncton, New Brunswick. Eric's Trip achieved prominence as the first Canadian band to be signed to Seattle's flagship grunge label Sub Pop in the early 1990s.[1] The band had a minor hit in alternative circles with the single &quot;Viewmaster&quot;, from 1994's Forever Again.\n\nEric's Trip formed in 1990 when musicians Rick White and Chris Thompson of The Forest joined Julie Doiron and Ed Vaughan (who was later replaced by Mark Gaudet of Purple Knight). They took their name from a Sonic Youth song[2] and emulated the distorted guitar of Dinosaur Jr., the folk leanings of Neil Young, and the lo-fi aesthetic of Sebadoh. Rick White described their sound as &quot;sappy melodic pop music on top of thick distortion.&quot; Gaudet's description was more succinct: &quot;dreamy punk&quot;.\n\nThe band broke up in 1996, but reunited in 2001, playing at the Sappy Records Festival in Sackville, New Brunswick from 2006-2009.[3][4] In 2010 both White and Doiron played separate sets at SappyFest.[5][6] Eric's Trip also played a series of shows in 2007, including a show at the 2007 Halifax Pop Explosion.[7]\n\nJulie Doiron currently has a successful solo career; in 1999, she recorded an album Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars with the Ottawa band Wooden Stars which won a Juno award for best album of the year,[8] and from 2003 to 2007 she performed with Shotgun &amp; Jaybird. Rick White and Mark Gaudet play in Elevator, and White has also released three solo albums under the name Rick White Album, The Rick White Album, Memoreaper and 137. Chris Thompson enjoyed some fame as Moon Socket, and currently plays in The Memories Attack with Ron Bates of Moncton band Orange Glass.\n\nWhite produced Doiron's solo albums Woke Myself Up (2007) and I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day (2009). Woke Myself Up features three tracks on which the entire Eric's Trip lineup contributed to the recording, their first studio collaboration since the band's 1996 breakup, while I Can Wonder has been described by critics as directly revisiting the sound and style of Eric's Trip for the first time in Doiron's solo career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Tara 1993\n\n\nLove Tara is the first full-length album by Canadian indie band Eric's Trip.\n\nThis was their first release on Seattle's Sub Pop record label, their second not independently released. This was the first time a Canadian band was signed to Sub-Pop. Self-recorded in three months, it embodied Sub-Pop's shift to lighter, more melodic music. Though the lo-fi quality of the record threw many listeners and critics off, it was still very well received in both Canada and the United States.\n\nIn Chart's Top 50 Canadian Albums of All Time polls, Love Tara ranked 35th in 1996 and 37th in 2000. It was also ranked 39th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\n\nSloan have covered the song &quot;Stove&quot; from this album. Their version, which appeared on the 1993 compilation album DGC Rarities Volume 1, combined &quot;Stove&quot; into a medley with &quot;Smother&quot;, a non-album track that Eric's Trip recorded for the Never Mind the Molluscs compilation.\n\nThe title of the album was referenced in The Tragically Hip's song &quot;Put It Off&quot;, from their 1996 album Trouble at the Henhouse: &quot;I played Love Tara/by Eric's Trip/on the day that you were born&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Behind the Garage&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n2.\t&quot;Anytime You Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:19\n3.\t&quot;Stove&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n4.\t&quot;Follow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n5.\t&quot;Secret for Julie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n6.\t&quot;Belly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n7.\t&quot;Sunlight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n8.\t&quot;June&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:14\n9.\t&quot;To Know Them&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:07\n10.\t&quot;Spring&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n11.\t&quot;Frame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:10\n12.\t&quot;May 11&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:18\n13.\t&quot;My Room&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n14.\t&quot;Blinded&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n15.\t&quot;Allergic to Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForever Again 1994\n\n\nForever Again is the second full-length album by Canadian indie band Eric's Trip.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;New Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n2.\t&quot;This Way Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:08\n3.\t&quot;About You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:22\n4.\t&quot;Girlfriend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:19\n5.\t&quot;Always There&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:53\n6.\t&quot;Stupidest Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n7.\t&quot;December '93&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:08\n8.\t&quot;Thoroughly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:14\n9.\t&quot;My Bed Is Red&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n10.\t&quot;View Master&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n11.\t&quot;Cloudy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:40\n12.\t&quot;My Chest Is Empty&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n13.\t&quot;Run Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n14.\t&quot;Waiting All Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n15.\t&quot;Let Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:45\n16.\t&quot;Hate Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n17.\t&quot;Feeling Around&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n18.\t&quot;Forever Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurple Blue 1996\n\n\nPurple Blue is the third full-length album by Canadian indie band Eric's Trip.
