Recently, researcher Nick Bryant obtained another rough copy which had been being prepared for airing in Ireland back in 1994.  It is longer and of better quality than the leaked copy from Gunderson and DeCamp.\n\n--------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_of_Silence_%28documentary%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_of_Silence_%28documentary%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Franklin child prostitution ring allegations were a series of high-profile accusations and legal actions surrounding an alleged child sex ring serving prominent citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, as well as high-level U.S. politicians. The scandal centered around the actions of Lawrence E. King, a prominent member of the Republican Party[1][2] and former official at the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union in Omaha. King was eventually arrested and convicted of embezzlement charges.\n\nThe allegations were investigated by a special Nebraska state legislative committee and the FBI. A 1990 grand jury report concluded the allegations amounted to a &quot;carefully crafted hoax,&quot; although the alleged perpetrators of said hoax were never officially identified. However, the special Nebraska legislative committee assigned to investigate the allegations criticized the grand juryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s report after finding no clear evidence that conclusively established what was the truth and what was a hoax. Allegations of a coverup, including claims of a connection between the Franklin case and a Washington, D.C. male prostitution ring, have circulated since.\n\nKing eventually served 10 years of a 15-year prison sentence for embezzlement and fraud. He was later served with a $1M default judgment after he failed to appear in court to respond to civil charges of kidnapping and child abuse.\n\n...\n\nMore allegations of a coverup came to light when a 56-minute documentary film about King's alleged child prostitution ring titled Conspiracy of Silence,[15] produced in 1993 by Yorkshire Television, surfaced on the Internet. The film features an interview with former CIA director William Colby, numerous members of the Nebraska state legislature including John DeCamp, and more than one alleged victim in the case.\n\nIn 2009, a new book by investigative journalist Nick Bryant was published about the scandal and alleged coverup. The book is titled: The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal.\n\n...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rumur.com/hoax&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rumur.com/hoax&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA Carefully Crafted Hoax is a feature investigative documentary that examines child prostitution and sexual exploitation in America by focusing on the well-documented story of Johnny Gosch, a paperboy adbucted in Des Moines, Iowa, and its connection to a notorious pedophile network based in Nebraska.\n\nThe shocking disclosures begin at an old brick warehouse in a seedy section of Washington, DC, progressing through the $40 million dollar bust-out of a nondescript Midwestern credit union and then back to a DC party-house that was wired for blackmail. A tragic tale that tears at your heart and rips your soul, A Carefully Crafted Hoax proves that child-pandering was covered up from the utmost pinnacle of power - using the CIA, FBI, Secret Service and a corrupt judicial process.\n\n\nA Carefully Crafted Hoax\nBy combining original footage, news clips, lost scenes from a suppressed documentary, Conspiracy of Silence, telephone recordings, classified documents, and interviews with the victims who are now adults, A Carefully Crafted Hoax builds on the mountain of existing evidence to present a portrait of Johnny, Paul, Alisha and the rest of the throwaway kids whose lives were fatefully intertwined in the disturbing world of child prostitution.\n\nThe film seeks to understand what happened to Johnny and elucidate Alisha's fate, and look at Boys Town's role in the national pandering network. What has become of King's pedophile ring? Who is collecting these kids off our streets and selling them? How can we stop it?\n\nFEATURING:\n\n- Noreen Gosch, Mother of Johnny Gosch\n- Lawrence King, Former President of Franklin Credit Union and accused ringleader of a national pedophile network\n- Paul Rodriguez, Washington Times, broke stories on powerbroker Craig Spence, King's partner in pandering and blackmail\n- John DeCamp, Former Nebraska senator who wrote The Franklin Cover-Up, a book detailing the scandal\n- Eulice Washington, First victim of King's to come forward\n- Tony Harris, Boys Town student who was flown around the country by King for sexual exploitation\n- Henry Vinson, owned the largest escort service in DC history and supplied escorts to Craig Spence and Larry King\n- Paul Bonacci, A victim who was awarded a $1 million judgement against King and admitted to abducting Johnny Gosch.\n- Fred Carter, Former Boys Town mayor who privy of Boys Town students being used for for sexual exploitation\n- Alisha Owen, One of six exploited kids to come forward and testify before the grand jury\n- William Colby, Former Director of CIA\n- Rusty Nelson, Blackmail photographer hired by King\n- Val Peter, President and director of Boys Town\n- Rue Fox, Former Boys Town student who was exploited by King\n- Troy Bonner, Former victim exploited by King\n- Nikolai Cayman, Former Boys Town student exploited by King\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM\n\nNick Bryant\nNick Bryant's writing has recurrently focused on the plight of disadvantaged children in the United States, and he's been published in numerous national journals, including the Journal of Professional Ethics, Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, Journal of Social Distress and Homelessness, Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved, and Journal of School Health.
