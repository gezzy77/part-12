Blues In The Afterburner continues in the tradition of smokin' blues with doses of heavy psychedelia throughout. Blues In The Afterburner contains a heavy load of Duarte 's legendary blues guitar chops over a diverse set of grooves and lyrical themes.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce11397a6e7b77fe4a8ea901a8064a9d65d0005","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Chris+Duarte+Group+-+Blues+In+The+Afterburner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce11397a6e7b77fe4a8ea901a8064a9d65d0005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,225,19,151,166,231,183,127,228,168,234,144,26,128,100,169,214,93,0,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
