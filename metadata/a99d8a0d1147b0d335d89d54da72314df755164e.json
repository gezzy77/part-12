New CAM audio and this release has hardcoded english subtitles for the non-english speaking parts (made by us).\nVideo was passed to me from a friend, he already cleaned it up real nice and worked on the original source, we just then adjusted\nthe colours slightly and brought it down to XviD. We then muxed and synced the new audio to the release, sounds better than the\nprevious version imo. We then created our own subfile with 36 lines of subs for non english parts and then synced them up with the\nvideo, we placed a blur over the other subtitles that were there so you can properly see the english ones, the blur lasts a good few\nminutes but goes away when all of the non-english parts have finally finished. Came out pretty nice in the end, decent enough CAM.\nWe said we were done with CAM's but figured we'd go the extra mile with this one just because we had the sources at hand.\nNone of that half assed **** here...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/v2MtQYy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/v2MtQYy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/wA2jHnZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/wA2jHnZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/beUSR55.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/beUSR55.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/45emKLX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/45emKLX.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/crBrnwz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.someimage.com/crBrnwz.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99d8a0d1147b0d335d89d54da72314df755164e","amp;dn":"A+Million+Ways+To+Die+In+The+West+2014+READNFO+NEW+CAM+XviD-HELL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99d8a0d1147b0d335d89d54da72314df755164e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,157,138,13,17,71,176,211,53,216,157,84,218,114,49,77,247,85,22,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
