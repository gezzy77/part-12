This is Sword City, a dark fantasy world that combines magic and technology. Explore, level up, make a perfect team, and slay monsters. But choose your allies carefully if you want to find a way home.\r\n\r\nIn Stranger of Sword City, you must perfect your DRPG skills and navigate your way through Escario, a place of fantasy races, fierce monsters, and treacherous labyrinths. Explore labyrinths to slay the powerful Lineage Type monsters within and take their Blood Crystals to increase your power. Who you decide to trust, be it the Kingdom, Medell Co., or the Strangers Guild, is entirely up to you. But choose wisely. Your fate depends on it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335b4152c85d807e883b6b5331bcbd87e0047624","amp;dn":"Stranger+of+Sword+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335b4152c85d807e883b6b5331bcbd87e0047624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,91,65,82,200,93,128,126,136,59,107,83,49,188,189,135,224,4,118,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
