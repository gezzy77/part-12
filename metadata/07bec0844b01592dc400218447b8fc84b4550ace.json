Moreover, the ecological \ndetails about methyl mercury contamination portrayed in the film are \naccurate, informative, and far more frightening than the storyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s monster. \nIn recent years, Prophecy has gained considerable popularity as an offbeat \ncult film.\n\nI love cheesy b-movies, but must confess that sometimes it is hard to \nshoulder through the low-grade filmmaking of most.  One of the advantages \nof Prophecy is that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite competently directed and the production \n(excepting the incredibly fake creatures) is comparable to other similar \nfilms of the 70s and early 80s. Prophecy boasts some really lovely scenery\n(with British Columbia doubling as Maine) and some acting that while not \ninspired, doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t cause one to cringe. You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get that often in schlock. \n\nThe movie opens with Spielbergian flashlight beams in the dark as something \nhunts a search party and later Maggie makes a grotesque discovery by the river; \nthe she-bearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deformed offspring are caught in a net, warbling mindlessly.  \nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scenes like these that make for nice, shivery, drive-in moments. Prophecy \nis also not without a twisted sense of humor. Classical music plays over scenes \nof an injured dog being air-lifted out of an attack site. Armand Assante, as the \ntoken Native American, stares stoically,  scans the trees for mutant bears and \ntries to forget the fact heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Italian.\n\nThere is a clear turning point in the film. A family of campers settle down for \nthe night , and are awakened by something growling. The daughter and father scream \nin terror as the meatloaf bear approaches, but its clearly too late for them. \nThe young boy, wrapped up tight in his bright yellow sleeping bag, pulls himself \nto his feet and begins to hop around the campsite like a big (mutant) banana. \nThe beast turns towards him and swats him into a rock where both the boy and \nsleeping bag explode into a flurry of feathers. As a kid, the scene was terrifying. \nAs an adult, its an hilarious, off-kilter moment worthy of cheering. After this, \nthe movie turns into a rubber-suit monster fest and never looks back.\n\nThe bear goes after the cubs and trashes a camp. In a scene that is reminiscent of \nJurassic Park, Assante, Foxworth and Shire flee in a truck as the bear lumbers \nbehind, trying to swipe and nudge them off the road. The movie becomes so intent on \nits obviously ridiculous monster it even forgets about Shires doomed pregnancy, the \nlogging debacle, and everything else.\n\nHowever, Prophecy has an atmosphere to it that helps the whole thing go down.  It \nembraces the roots of a cheesy monster picture, but at some level it still operates \non that dark, serious tone of the 70s that gave us movies like Deliverance and Jaws. \nIts not a scab on the knee of either of those movies, but utilizing that style makes \nit seem more legitimate. If you are a die-hard horror fan, you definitely need \nto check it out. Its not going to scare you, or make you reconsider eating the fish in \nMaine, but its such a spirited failure that it can't help but be entertaining.\n\n-------------- SCREENSHOTS ----------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32997.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32997.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32999.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-32999.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-33000.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/33000/photo-33000.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33002.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33002.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33004.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33004.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33005.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33005.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33006.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33006.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33007.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/34000/photo-33007.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------------------------------   \n   \n   General\n\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 42mn\n      Overall bit rate : 959 Kbps\n      Writing library : VirtualDub-MPEG2 build 24586/release\n   \n   Video \n      \n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : DX50\n      Codec ID/Hint : DivX 5\n      Duration : 1h 42mn\n      Bit rate : 838 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.201\n      Stream size : 612 MiB (87%)\n      Writing library : DivX 6.8.4\n   \n   Audio \n      \n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 42mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 112 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 81.7 MiB (12%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 512 ms\n\n   Source\n \n       Region One DVD(NTSC) 720 x 480 29.970 fps 2.35:1\n       Color AC3 Dolby 2CH Stereo 192 Kb/s 48.0 KHz\n\n\n   Encode Note\n\n      All Distributor &amp; Production Logo's Removed due to space\n      constraints.
