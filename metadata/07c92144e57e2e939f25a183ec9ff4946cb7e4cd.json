Erickson, M.D. Each card in the ZEBU deck has a language pattern written at the top and bottom, and a commentary in the center. ZEBU is a tool you can use to practice and learn important language patterns and have fun doing it! Playing ZEBU is learning at its best, because the whole time is spent listening to and using the language patterns -- and it&amp;#039;s entertaining. Instructions, insightful commentary, and examples are included.\n\nAbout the Author\n&quot;I created ZEBU to help me teach my classes in Ericksonian Hypnosis. The level of proficiency that my students developed was nothing short of phenomenal, and it&amp;#039;s all due to this card game . . . Playing ZEBU we&amp;#039;ve laughed so hard it hurt, and at other times we&amp;#039;ve used the ZEBU cards to actually hypnotize members of the class. Enjoy!&quot; -- Robert Anue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c92144e57e2e939f25a183ec9ff4946cb7e4cd","amp;dn":"Zebu+-+The+Hypnotic+Language+Pattern+card+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c92144e57e2e939f25a183ec9ff4946cb7e4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,201,33,68,229,126,46,147,159,37,161,131,236,159,244,148,108,183,228,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
