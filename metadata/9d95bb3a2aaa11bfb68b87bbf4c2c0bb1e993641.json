Animal bones were consulted as oracles to answer the great questions of life and death, and ancestral spirits were thought to roam the earth, negotiating with the gods on behalf of the living. From the legends of the Eight Immortals to the teachings of Confucius, &quot;Chinese Mythology A to Z, Second Edition&quot; provides a refreshing, insightful look at the stories and myths that open a window onto this civilization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d95bb3a2aaa11bfb68b87bbf4c2c0bb1e993641","amp;dn":"Chinese+Mythology+A+to+Z%2C+2+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d95bb3a2aaa11bfb68b87bbf4c2c0bb1e993641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,149,187,58,42,170,17,191,182,139,135,187,244,194,192,187,30,153,54,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
