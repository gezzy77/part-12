It wasn't just their crushingly loud interpretation of the blues -- it was how they incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) -- into their sound. Led Zeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested the band. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. More than any other band, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as singles. In doing so, they established the dominant format for heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Song Remains The Same\n02.No Quarter\n03.Houses Of The Holy\n04.Trampled Under Foot\n05.Kashmir\n06.Ten Years Gone\n07.Achilles Last Stand\n08.Nobody's Fault But Mine\n09.All My Love\n10.In The Evening\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cd4bfa2ec98f9282b0a470a5a9938604909fbd0","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Latter+Days+Best+Of+Vol.+2+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cd4bfa2ec98f9282b0a470a5a9938604909fbd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,212,191,162,236,152,249,40,43,10,71,10,90,153,56,96,73,9,251,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
