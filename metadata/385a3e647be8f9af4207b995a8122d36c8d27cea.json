At times, it has a similar vibrato to Aaron Neville, and the deep resonance of George Jones, combining to create a unique dramatic style.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385a3e647be8f9af4207b995a8122d36c8d27cea","amp;dn":"Doug+Stone-Greatest+Hits+Volume+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385a3e647be8f9af4207b995a8122d36c8d27cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,90,62,100,123,232,249,175,66,7,185,149,168,18,45,54,200,210,124,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
