When  \n this news reaches Rohit's mother, Sonia, in    \n India, she passes this on to Rohit's wife,     \n Nisha, who has just given birth to a son named \n Krishna. However, Nisha, unable to handle this \n devastating news, passes away, leaving Krishna \n to be brought up by Sonia. When Krishna is     \n enrolled in school, she notices that he has    \n the same intellectual and physical powers that \n his father possessed, so in order to shield him\n from any harm, she moves to a secluded and remo\n area in a mountainous region of the country,   \n where he grows up. Years later, Krishna has    \n matured, has acquired the same special powers  \n                                                \n    IMDB Link :                                 \n                                                \n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432637/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432637/&lt;/a&gt;     \n                                                \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/3462/79058776.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/3462/79058776.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8020/39086213.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8020/39086213.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5724/43082029.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5724/43082029.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/3230/57887166.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/3230/57887166.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3497/14309314.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/3497/14309314.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/8382/47382541.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/8382/47382541.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a6a59835bf33fcd2e7b814d685f82d345f69f79","amp;dn":"Krrish+%282006%29+-+Blu-Ray+-+x264+-+720p+-+mHD+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a6a59835bf33fcd2e7b814d685f82d345f69f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,106,89,131,91,243,63,205,46,123,129,77,104,95,130,211,69,246,159,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
