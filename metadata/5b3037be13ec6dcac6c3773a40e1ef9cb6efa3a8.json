In 1865, Dr. Mudd, a known Confederate sympathizer, sets the broken leg of a mud-caked stranger who stumbles into his home. The injured man turns out to be John Wilkes Booth, and Mudd is accused of conspiring to murder President Lincoln. Sentenced to hang with the genuine conspirators, Mudd finds his sentence commuted to life imprisonment at the very last moment. He is shipped to Shark Island, a brutal penal colony. Subject to the cruelties of a guard (John Carradine) who hates Mudd because of his &quot;complicity&quot; in Lincoln's death, the doctor suffers the torments of the damned, while outside Shark Island his wife (Gloria Stuart) campaigns desperately to get her husband pardoned. During a Yellow Fever breakout on Shark Island, Dr. Mudd performs heroically to save the survivors. For his humanitarian efforts, Mudd is finally released and reunited with his wife. While the script glosses over the fact that Dr. Mudd had never been officially pardoned by the US government (the pardon wouldn't be granted until years after this film was made), Prisoner of Shark Island strives long and hard to exonerate the man for whom the phrase &quot;your name is mud!&quot; was coined.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Prisoner of Shark Island.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.07 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 596 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 1 444 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.196\n      Stream size : 992 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 71.2 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 88.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 48.9 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 258 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5 --abr 88\n      Language : English\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 60.0 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 41.2 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 307 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 16.5 --abr 64\n      Language : English\n\nIMDB: tt0028141\n\nEnglish audio; English, French and Spanish subpacl (idx/sub), English and Portuguese srt subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3037be13ec6dcac6c3773a40e1ef9cb6efa3a8","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+The+Prisoner+of+Shark+Island+%5B1936%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3037be13ec6dcac6c3773a40e1ef9cb6efa3a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,48,55,190,19,236,109,202,198,195,119,58,64,225,239,156,182,239,163,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
