They were first published in Salzburg in 1682, where Georg Muffat (1653?1704) had found employment as organist and valet at the court of Archbishop Maximillian Gandolf after a peripatetic career that had already taken him from his native Savoy to Lully?s Paris, Vienna, and Prague, where he became acquainted with the music of Schmelzer and Kerll. At the beginning of the 1680s, Muffat gained permission to travel to Rome for further study. There he went to Bernardo Pasquini, the leading Italian keyboard virtuoso, and, crucially, came into contact with Corelli. Muffat?s well-traveled background played a major role in forging a style embracing truly pan-European influences.\n(Brian Robins)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae82be919cabe9f66a0082ea11fa17dc7673ad21","amp;dn":"Georg+Muffat+-+Armonico+Tributo+%28Concerti+grossi%29+Ensemble+415","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae82be919cabe9f66a0082ea11fa17dc7673ad21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,130,190,145,156,171,233,246,106,0,130,234,17,250,23,220,118,115,173,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
