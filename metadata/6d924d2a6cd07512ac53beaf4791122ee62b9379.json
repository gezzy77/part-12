Included are: * Individual weapons-from spears to the submachine gun. * Crew-served weapons-from battering rams to &quot;Big Bertha&quot;. * Unmanned weapons-from punji stakes to &quot;Bouncing Betty&quot; landmines and trap guns. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare even includes devices that, strictly speaking, are weapons carriers, such as tanks and bombers, but which have had enormous effects on the conduct of war. This book describes the effects of these weapons and how and why they changed warfare-from the bloody carnage produced by hand weapons throughout history to the never used but universally feared fusion bomb, whose sole purpose is to destroy millions of people while leaving buildings intact. Each weapon is not only described, but also illustrated to give a clearer picture of its usage and effects.\n\n\n# Publisher \tNew Page Books (February 1, 2005)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t1564147568\n# ISBN-13 \t978-1564147561","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d924d2a6cd07512ac53beaf4791122ee62b9379","amp;dn":"50+Weapons+That+Changed+Warfare+by+William+Weir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d924d2a6cd07512ac53beaf4791122ee62b9379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,146,77,42,108,208,117,18,172,83,190,175,71,145,18,46,230,43,147,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
