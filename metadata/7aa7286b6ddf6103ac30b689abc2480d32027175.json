It's an exe, so you'll have to run it in a virtual machine (or duel boot). I couldn't get it to run in Wine. I also don't know of a working keygen that runs on Linux normally, maybe you can find one, if you really want to.\n\nOnce you have the keygen running;\n\n1. Install the program, then run it. It will ask you to activate.\n\n2. Click &quot;Other ways to activate&quot;, or something like that, and pick &quot;Manuel&quot;.\n\n3. Enter your Math ID into the Keygen, and click &quot;Save Mathpass&quot;. (your Math ID doesn't change, so you can write it down for later use, if this helps)\n\n4. Copy the resulting activation key and password, and accept the agreement.\n\n5. Congrats, you have the program!\n\nIf you're having problems, you probably wrote your Math ID in the keygen wrong. MAKE SURE YOU ENTERED IT IN CORRECTLY. This is the main reason people have problems. Check, then re-check. It should work.\n\nAdditionally, I've been told that not all generated passwords work. If one fails, and you are certain you entered your ID correctly, generate a new one. It will work eventually. It worked for me with the first password both times I installed, so this is second hand.\n\n\nIf you have the money and you like the product, buy it yourself.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wolfram.com/mathematica-home-edition/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wolfram.com/mathematica-home-edition/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa7286b6ddf6103ac30b689abc2480d32027175","amp;dn":"Mathematica+9+%28Linux%2FUnix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa7286b6ddf6103ac30b689abc2480d32027175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,167,40,107,109,223,97,3,172,48,182,137,171,194,72,13,50,2,113,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
