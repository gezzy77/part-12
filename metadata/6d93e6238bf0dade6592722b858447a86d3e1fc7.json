Each kinden is a fictional race of humans, named after (and having certain characteristics of) an insect. Kinden are typically divided into two categories : Apt and Inapt. The Apt do not have magical abilities, but are able to understand, use and design mechanical devices. The Inapt have varying amounts of magical abilities, but cannot use mechanical devices, even those as simple as latches. The series focuses on the attempted conquest of the lowlands by the Wasp-kinden empire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d93e6238bf0dade6592722b858447a86d3e1fc7","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky%2C+Adrian++-+%5BShadows+of+the+Apt+01-+07%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d93e6238bf0dade6592722b858447a86d3e1fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,147,230,35,139,240,218,222,101,146,114,43,133,132,71,168,109,62,31,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
