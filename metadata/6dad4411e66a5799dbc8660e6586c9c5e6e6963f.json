The punk rock influenced album proved popular in the UK and Ireland, and to a lesser degree elsewhere, where Britpop was a smaller cult phenomenon.\nThe title refers to a year of three events that shaped the band: the births of two of the band-members; the year the first punk albums were released; and the release of Star Wars. The album opens with the sound of a TIE Fighter, and ends with the track &quot;Darkside Lightside&quot;, the title of which is a Star Wars reference, and which climaxes with a choral version of the Star Wars theme. The band also covered &quot;Cantina Band&quot;, as the b-side to the &quot;Girl From Mars&quot; single.\nJackie Chan is celebrated in the lyrics of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, and used the song for the end credits of his movie Rumble in the Bronx. The song &quot;Lose Control&quot; was featured in the game Gran Turismo: the first time one of the band's songs was used in a videogame. It was later followed by &quot;Orpheus&quot; from the album Meltdown, featured in Burnout 3: Takedown. Both Gran Turismo and Burnout are racing games.\n\nTrack List:\n\n&quot;Lose Control&quot; (Hamilton/Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n&quot;Goldfinger&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n&quot;Girl from Mars&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:30\n&quot;I'd Give You Anything&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:31\n&quot;Gone the Dream&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n&quot;Kung Fu&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:17\n&quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:45\n&quot;Let It Flow&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n&quot;Innocent Smile&quot; (Hamilton) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:52\n&quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; (McMurray/Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n&quot;Lost in You&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n&quot;Darkside Lightside&quot; (Wheeler) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 16:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dad4411e66a5799dbc8660e6586c9c5e6e6963f","amp;dn":"Ash+-+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dad4411e66a5799dbc8660e6586c9c5e6e6963f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,173,68,17,230,106,87,153,219,200,102,14,101,134,201,197,230,230,150,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
