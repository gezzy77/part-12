UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems. This is the nature of highly compressed content.\n2. If you have any problemms with your video player check PLAYER folder.\n3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this release - tell others about it.\nIf you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the future .\n4. I can confirm that XBox360 will play 5.1 AAC through WINDOWS media center extender. For more info read this forum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.avforums.com/forums/streamers-network-media-players/1107552-what-xbox-360-like-media-extender.html&lt;/a&gt;\n5. If you like the movie, show your gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD !\n6. These movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player version 9 or higher.\n7. The name FASM was derived from assembler efficiency. When you write something directly in assembler,  it usually\nruns much faster and has smaller size, than the same thing written in C, Java etc. It also means FAchman SoofMan\n- founders of FASM\n8. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized directly for lowbitrate HD contents.\nIt is constantly being improved,  each revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard\nx264 encoding is explained by the same reasons as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3.\n9. FASM recommends IMGBURN for burning those files into DVD.\n10. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source (Bluray Rip) should also work with this release.\n11. FASM 720p releases will concentrate more on size to keep it as low as possible (including true HD quality of the video\nwith some minor artifacts) and special STEREO sound to allow play these directly on most devices possible (even on newer cellphones.)\n12. FASM 1080p releases will concentrate more on quality, but the size will be low enough and will contain\nAAC5.1 sound encoded to highest possible level. The goal would be to create eBDRip with quality better than Bluray original itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2047cd32d8723eb8ea583925806659600040c09","amp;dn":"Ninja+Assassin+2009+720p+BluRay+QEBS+AAC+PS3+MP4-FASM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2047cd32d8723eb8ea583925806659600040c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,4,124,211,45,135,35,235,142,165,131,146,88,6,101,150,0,4,12,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
