Youâ€™re\r\nalso investigating designs that help you maximize uptime and manage security.\r\n\r\nThis book is your guide to Elixir, a modern, functional, and concurrent\r\nprogramming language. Because Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, and uses the\r\nunderlying Erlang/OTP architecture, it benefits from almost 20 years of\r\nresearch into high performance, highly parallel, and seriously robust\r\napplications. Elixir brings a lot thatâ€™s new: a modern, Ruby-like, extendable\r\nsyntax, compile and runtime evaluation, a hygienic macro system, and more.\r\n\r\nBut, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel,\r\nfunctional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the\r\nlanguage encourages you to experiment.\r\n\r\nPart 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. Weâ€™ll look at\r\nthe language, the tools, and the conventions.\r\n\r\nPart 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent codeâ€”applications that use\r\nall the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do\r\nit both with and without OTP.\r\n\r\nAnd Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and\r\ncode generation to extending the syntax.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this book, youâ€™ll understand Elixir, and know how to apply it to\r\nsolve your complex, modern problems.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\n\r\nDave Thomas is a programmer who likes to evangelize cool stuff. He cowrote\r\n&quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; and was one of the creators of the Agile Manifesto.\r\nHis book &quot;Programming Ruby&quot; introduced the Ruby language to the world, and\r\n&quot;Agile Web Development with Rails&quot; helped kickstart the Rails revolution.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPublisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf\r\nEdition: 1st edition (October 19, 2014)\r\nPages: 323\r\nFile Type: PDF\r\nFile Size: 3.59 MB\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1937785580\r\nISBN-13: 978-1937785581\r\nURL: https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90875ddcb21d05257b8f9b897c0ecdbbc1a882e","amp;dn":"Programming+Elixir+%28Dave+Thomas%2C+1st+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90875ddcb21d05257b8f9b897c0ecdbbc1a882e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,8,117,221,203,33,208,82,87,184,249,184,151,192,236,219,188,26,136,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
