C. Fogerty (tracks: A1, A2, A4, B2 to D1)\n Notes\nÃ¢â€žâ€”1973 Fantasy Records \n Produced by DSR \n Recorded live during Creedence Clearwater Revival's concert tour of Europe, September 4 thru 28, 1971\n\n The critics despised this live recording (poor sound, flat, etc). Since I am not critical (thank God), but a simple listener and -of course- I have another perspective. This double LP I heard when I was 10 years old with my older brother, although that Tom Fogerty left the group, John has no problem in meeting the lack of the second guitar. \n There memorable versions of songs like &quot;Lodi&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, &quot;Hey Tonight&quot;, etc, etc.\n For me this is an excellent LP, a fundamental part of the CCR discography. 5 stars (oh yeah!).\n Ps.: I am a romantic and I like this poor sound but genuine, like Woodstock. Yes, good memories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f475f32cd398c14a1a2138bc31d3ebb9bf3de75","amp;dn":"CCR+%26lrm%3B-+Live+In+Europe%281973%292LP%27s+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f475f32cd398c14a1a2138bc31d3ebb9bf3de75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,71,95,50,205,57,140,20,161,162,19,139,195,29,62,187,155,243,222,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
