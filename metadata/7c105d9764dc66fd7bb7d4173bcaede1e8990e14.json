Guacamelee builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these.\n\nThe game features a down on his luck Mexican named Juan Aguacate, who sets out to save the world when El PresidenteÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Daughter is kidnapped by an Evil Charro Skeleton. The story takes place in and around a small village in Mexico, and has the player travelling through alternate dimensions: ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£The World of the LivingÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ and ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£The World of  the DeadÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ on his quest to rescue the girl he loves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c105d9764dc66fd7bb7d4173bcaede1e8990e14","amp;dn":"Guacamelee%3A+Gold+Edition+%5BWineskin%5D+%5BFix%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c105d9764dc66fd7bb7d4173bcaede1e8990e14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,16,93,151,100,220,102,253,123,183,212,23,59,202,237,225,232,153,14,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
