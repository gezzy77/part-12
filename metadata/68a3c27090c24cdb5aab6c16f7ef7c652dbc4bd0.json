One is that nothing will ever come between her and her best friend, Kya Kessler. They have a pact. Buds Before Studs. Sisters Before Misters. But in the summer before senior year, life throws out challenges they never expected. And suddenly the person who's always been there starts to need the favor returned. Grace and Kya are forced to question how much a best friend can forgive. And the answer is not what they expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a3c27090c24cdb5aab6c16f7ef7c652dbc4bd0","amp;dn":"Janet+Gurtler%2C+How+I+Lost+You+%5BYA%5D+epub+kindle+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a3c27090c24cdb5aab6c16f7ef7c652dbc4bd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,163,194,112,144,194,76,219,90,171,108,22,247,239,124,101,45,188,75,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
