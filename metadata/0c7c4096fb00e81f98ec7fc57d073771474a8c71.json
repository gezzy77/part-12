Partnered with kung fu fighting Mainland Chinese lady cop Michelle Yeoh, Jackie risks life and limb to inflitrate an international arms smuggling racket. The film travels all over Southeast Asia, and features some incredible stunts including a motorcycle jump onto a moving train. The beautiful Maggie Cheung plays Chan's girlfriend and adds an interesting element to the plot when she appears at the most inopportune moments. The ingenuity of the stunts alone makes this film worth watching. Unlike some Chan movies, this one actually has a plot. \n \nCast: \n\nJackie Chan (Sing Lung)  ||  Michelle Yeoh (Yeung Chi-King)  ||  Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk  ||  Yuen Wah  ||  Bill Tung Piu  ||  Kelvin Wong  ||  Kenneth Tsang Kong  ||  Josephine Koo Mei-Wah \n \nRunning Time: \n\n91 mins.

It is also not a dragon dynasty remaster as the cover i have included suggests. If anyone has the 2disc dragon dynasty version, i would very much like it.
