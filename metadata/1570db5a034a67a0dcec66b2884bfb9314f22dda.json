However, this 1978 release, which was previously only available in Japan, is a rare gem in the Hancock discography. Thanks ... Full Descriptionto this overdue 2004 reissue, the listener is invited to explore the musical mind of this pianist in an up-close and intimate setting. All 11 tracks on THE PIANO are quite reflective, with Hancock employing many rich chordal textures and winding melodic gestures throughout. On &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; Hancock combines the harmonic palette of Bill Evans with his own distinctive phrasing and unexpected modal shifts. His own composition &quot;Blue Otani&quot; is the only bluesy piece on this disc, and here Hancock slyly suggests the stride piano tradition without ever really playing in this style.\n\n&quot;Harvest Time&quot; is the most atmospheric piece on the album. As Hancock's fingers glide over the keys, one can almost envision the first blush of daybreak on a farm. For anybody seeking to better understand the conceptual and technical wizardry of Hancock, THE PIANO is a priceless find.\n\nPersonnel: Herbie Hancock (piano)\n\ntracklist:\n01.
