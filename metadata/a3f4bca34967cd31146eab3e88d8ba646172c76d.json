During the 1960s, he performed with Magic Sam. He also performed in Muddy Waters's band from 1972 to 1980. In 1980, four of his songs were included on an anthology by Alligator Records. Johnson moved to the East Coast and began fronting his own band, the Magic Rockers. His &quot;Walkin' The Dog,&quot; was recorded live at the Montreux Festival's Blues Night. Johnson won a Grammy Award in 1985 for Best Traditional Blues Album for his part in Blues Explosion. Johnson appeared on three albums by The Nighthawks. He now lives in New Hampshire. Johnson's third and final album for producer Ron Levy's 'Bullseye Blues' diskery is every bit as spellbinding as the prior pair. Whether fronting his latest batch of 'Magic Rockers' or going it alone, Johnson is totally convincing.~~ by Bill Dahl\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Walkin' With You Baby 4:17\n2.
