It was recorded and released in 1983. Most fans, as well as the band themselves, refer to this album as the &quot;Mama&quot; album. In some cases, notably amongst the Genesis online community, it has been referred to as the &quot;Shapes&quot; or &quot;Gold Shapes&quot; album because of the front cover artwork.\n\nFurther successes &quot;That's All&quot; (which became the band's first US Top 10 hit), &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; and &quot;Taking It All Too Hard&quot; ensured that Genesis was well received, and it consequently reached #1 in the UK where it remained in the charts for 51 weeks. It also reached #9 in the US, eventually selling over four million copies there alone.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Mama                                                 [06:48]\n02.That's all                                           [04:26]\n03.Home by the sea                                      [04:53]\n04.Second home by the sea                               [06:23]\n05.Illegal alien                                        [05:15]\n06.Taking it all too hard                               [03:58]\n07.Just A job to do                                     [04:48]\n08.Silver rainbow                                       [04:30]\n09.It's gonna get better                                [04:58]\n____\n\n45:59 min\n 64,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061224df0065cd066405a3dd24064a61a091b6ac","amp;dn":"Genesis-Genesis-%28Retail%29-1983-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061224df0065cd066405a3dd24064a61a091b6ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,18,36,223,0,101,205,6,100,5,163,221,36,6,74,97,160,145,182,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
