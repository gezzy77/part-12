As the self-consciously dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock &amp; roll that came to define hard rock. With his preening machismo and latent maliciousness, Mick Jagger became the prototypical rock frontman, tempering his macho showmanship with a detached, campy irony while Keith Richards and Brian Jones wrote the blueprint for sinewy, interlocking rhythm guitars. Backed by the strong yet subtly swinging rhythm section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones became the breakout band of the British blues scene.\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Miss You\n02.Beast Of Burden\n03.Shattered\n04.Let Me Go\n05.Emotional Rescue\n06.She's So Cold\n07.Start Me Up\n08.Hang Fire\n09.Neighbours\n10.Waiting On A Friend\n11.Undercover Of The Night\n12.She Was Hot\n13.Too Tough\n14.One Hit (To The Body)\n15.Harlem Shuffle\n16.Winning Ugly\n17.Sad Sad Sad\n18.Mixed Emotions\n19.Almost Hear You Sigh\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Rock And A Hard Place\n02.Love Is Strong\n03.You Got Me Rocking\n04.Sparks Will Fly\n05.Out Of Tears\n06.I Go Wild\n07.Like A Rolling Stone (Live)\n08.Flip The Switch\n09.Anybody Seen My Baby\n10.Gunface\n11.Saint Of Me\n12.Always Suffering\n13.Don't Stop\n14.Rough Justice\n15.Rain Fall Down\n16.Streets Of Love\n17.Biggest Mistake\n18.Oh No, Not You Again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043663aa96dc42feb95a79b0673696cffe851998","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Greatest+Hits+Part+2+%5B2CD%5D+%282008%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043663aa96dc42feb95a79b0673696cffe851998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,54,99,170,150,220,66,254,185,90,121,176,103,54,150,207,254,133,25,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
