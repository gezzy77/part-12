Both cuts were recorded in February of 1966 in San Francisco, with Trane fronting his final quintet with Alice, Pharoah Sanders, Jimmy Garrison, Rashied Ali, and Ray Appleton adding percussion.\n \n&quot;Manifestation&quot; is a fierce blowout featuring a freely pulsating rhythm which provides the two tenors with a ground from where to start their flight. Alice Coltrane's piano solo is really capturing. Then, the two tenors pick up again, this time both at the same time. Pharoah Sanders can also be heard on piccolo on this tune, which adds an interesting note.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Reverend KingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begins moodily, but soon erupts into another extended forest fire of sound until you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where you were when you first showed up; this music goes straight to the head, tosses you around, and tricks you into wanting a little bit more. The track documents the kinked-out noise of Coltrane, slam-dunking the bass clarinet he inherited from Eric Dolphy.\n \nThe remaining two tracks &quot;Lord, Help Me to Be&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; are much mellower and more structured and were later included as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of Alice Coltrane's album Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Monastic Trio&quot;. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Cosmic MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of TraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most unconventional, played in free meter and with almost no harmonic structure. Spiritual, cosmic music.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nCosmic Music\n\nRecorded in 1966 / 1968, released in 1968\n\n\n\n  CD / 2011 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Manifestation\n\n2.
