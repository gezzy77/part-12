Bonnie Tyler is my TOP favourite singer EVER.I find her songs and,of course,her voice amazing.But unfortunately,although there are billions of Bonnie Tyler compilations out there,I don't think they do her justice,either because they focus on a specific part of her career or because they miss some important songs. So,this time, I created a 2 CD compilation of songs that I consider essential Bonnie Tyler tracks.Once again,all songs are in their album versions. \n\nTRACKLIST\n\nCD1\n01.Lost in France\n02.More than a lover\n03.It's a heartache\n04.The world is full of married men\n05.My guns are loaded\n06.Sitting on the edge of the ocean\n07.Total eclipse of the heart\n08.Faster than the speed of night\n09.Have you ever seen the rain\n10.Straight from the heart\n11.A rockin' good way(To mess around and fall in love)\n12.Here she comes\n13.Matter of the heart\n14.If you were a woman(and I was a man)\n15.Loving you's a dirty job(but somebody's gotta do it)\n16.Holding out for a hero\nTOTAL RUNTIME: Approximately 74 minutes\n\nCD2\n01.Ravishing\n02.Islands\n03.Hide your heart\n04.To love somebody\n05.Bitterblue\n06.Against the wind\n07.Fool's lullaby\n08.Race to the fire\n09.Sally comes around\n10.Say goodbye\n11.Limelight\n12.Two out of three ain't bad\n13.Making love out of nothing at all\n14.Tyre tracks and broken hearts\n15.Si demain(Turn around)\n16.Believe in me\nTOTAL RUNTIME: Approximately 77 minutes\n\nAll songs are in MP3,320 kbps format.There are also 2 M3U-lists(one for each CD) and two album covers,both made by me:D\nOnce again,I'm asking you to comment after downloading,to tell me whether you liked my compilation or not,and if you liked it,to seed.\n\nHope you have a really nice time:)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55884574152a44af33e0559e7b75e19c60617ee0","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Tyler-The+Essentials+%282+CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55884574152a44af33e0559e7b75e19c60617ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,136,69,116,21,42,68,175,51,224,85,158,123,117,225,156,96,97,126,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
