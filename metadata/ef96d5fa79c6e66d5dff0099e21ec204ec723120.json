Pretty confident\n26:32 - Eating her food isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a big deal at all\n27:04 - Third person perspective: you guys are a couple\n27:16 - Interaction seem like a date, even though you just met\n27:40 - Always try to sit next to her: don't be too formal\n27:45 - Sitting across from her is like an interview\n27:50 - Sitting next to her is more intimate\n27:58 - Feels like a date\n28:33 - Girls are insecure in the way they eat\n28:43 - Compliment them eating, is a good thing\n28:49 - Pointing out the elephant in the room: eases the tension\n28:56 - Subconsciously telling: I'm watching you eat and kindly judging her\n29:03 - Playfully teasing her, yet complimenting her at the same time\n29:29 - When you notice a girl packing up her things, or looking at the time, is the cue to end the conversation\n29:34 - Ending the conversation as soon as she has to go\n29:46 - When you leave the conversation knowing she has to go, it shows you are attuned to how sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling at the moment\n29:53 - When a guy can show a girl that he knows how sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling, is a great thing\n30:07 - It's how comfortable you are in the situation\n30:17 - If you're relaxed, she will be relaxed\n \nThere is this mindset that you cannot approach a girl who is eating, and this mindset is dead wrong. Jason shows and teaches you how to approach a hot girl while she's eating and get yourself in the right state to create a very intimate setting. It's a different type of an approach, where food gets interchanged from one mouth to the other.\n \nLastly, we apologize for anything said in the episode you find offensive.
