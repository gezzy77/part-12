The album was put out after releasing three singles, namely &quot;Swear It Again&quot;, &quot;If I Let You Go&quot; and &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot;, all of which were UK #1 singles. The album entered the UK chart at its number 2 peak, selling little over 83,000, 1,000 sales short of being number one, which was occupied by &quot;Steptacular&quot; by Steps. The album was the 8th best selling of 1999 in the UK.\nOverseas, this was released on US in 2000 with different tracklisting and adding &quot;My Private Movie&quot; produced by Cutfather and Joe. It remains the only Westlife album to date to chart in the US, peaking at #129 on the Billboard 200. It also peaked at #15 in Australia.\nMore Than Words, an The Extreme original, has been a single released in Brazil and peaked at #2.\nIn December that same year, the double a-side single &quot;I Have A Dream&quot;/&quot;Seasons In The Sun&quot; became the Christmas #1 single of the year, and it remains as the most successful single of the band. In March 2000, the fifth and final single from the album, &quot;Fool Again&quot;, was released and also debuted at #1.\nWith this, Westlife achieved five #1 singles from the same album in less than a year, a record that remains unbroken to date.\nThis said album was released into a boxed set with their album Turnaround on 25 January 2005. Nothing changes with the original tracklisting.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Sweart It Again\n[02] If I Let You Go\n[03] Flying Witout Wings\n[04] Fool Again\n[05] No No\n[06] I Don't Wanna Fight\n[07] Change the World\n[08] Moments\n[09] Seasons in the Sun\n[10] I Need You\n[11] Miss You\n[12] More Than Words\n[13] Open Your Heart\n[14] Try Again\n[15] What I Want Is What I've Got\n[16] We Are One\n[17] Can't Lose What You Never Had\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:05m:39s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 161mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.6.1.9 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 01 November 1999 [UK] 07 December 1999 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Sony BMG\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.westlife.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/westlife \n\t\t\t-\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFlying Without Wings [CDS - 1] - Westlife [1999]\n\n\nCDS - 1\n\n[01] Flying Without Wings\n[02] Everybody Knows\n\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] Flying Without Wings [42mb]\n\n\n\nFlying Without Wings [CDS - 2] - Westlife [1999]\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Flying Without Wings\n[02] That's What It's All About\n[03] Flying Without Wings (Acapella Mix)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf I Let You Go [CDS - 1] - Westlife [1999]\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] If I Let You Go (Radio Edit)\n[02] If I Let You Go\n[03] Interview With Andi Peters\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I Let You Go [CDS - 2] - Westlife [1999]\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] If I Let You Go (Radio Edit)\n[02] Try Again\n\n \n\nMusic Video \n\n[01] If I Let You Go\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSwear It Again [CDS] - Westlife [1999]\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Swear It Again (Radio Edit)\n[02] Swear It Again (Rokstone Mix)\n[03] Ronan Keating Interviews Westlife (Audio)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFool Again (2000 Remix) [CDS] - Westlife [2000]\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Fool Again (2000 Remix)\n[02] Tunnel Of Love\n\n \n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] Fool Again [57mb]\n\n\n\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.westlife.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/westlife \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbce22640cf394cb6c459db63be1b329cb2ec0a0","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Westlife+-+Westlife+%26+4CDSingles+-+161mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbce22640cf394cb6c459db63be1b329cb2ec0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,206,34,100,12,243,148,203,108,69,157,182,59,225,179,41,203,46,192,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
