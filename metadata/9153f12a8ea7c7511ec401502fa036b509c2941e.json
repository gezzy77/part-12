This mythological Septuagint has been used by Bible corrupters as an excuse for changing the God-honored text of the English Bible (AV 1611) more than 233 times since 1880.\nHerein is proven that not once has any Christian scholar in England, Africa, Europe, Asia, or the Americas ever produced one verse or one part of any verse of a Greek Old Testament written before A.D. 220 that any New Testament writer quoted.\nThe mythological Septuagint belongs to the annals of religious fiction in the primeval subconsciousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of all Alexandrians. Only DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fairytale for grown-ups would compete with it when it comes to sheer fanaticism, lack of evidence, distortion of historical facts, irrational ethnic biases, inability to properly interpret data, and out-and-out lying, in order to sustain a reputation for scholars who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the spirituality or intelligence of a Moonie selling roses on a street corner.\nThe LXX is a pillar of faith upon which much of the beliefs of the Alexandrian Cult rest. Is its existence fact or fiction? Find out the truth about the Mythological Septuagint.\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9153f12a8ea7c7511ec401502fa036b509c2941e","amp;dn":"The+Mythological+Septuagint+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9153f12a8ea7c7511ec401502fa036b509c2941e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,83,241,42,142,167,199,81,30,196,1,80,47,160,54,181,9,194,148,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
