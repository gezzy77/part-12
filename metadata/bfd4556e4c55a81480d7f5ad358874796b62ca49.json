Linsner has garnered some acclaim by farming out his talents as a cover artist with varying degrees of success and quality over the years.  However, whenever he returns to working on a Dawn project, the quality of his work is unsurpassed. The books themselves are a heady mix of horror, occult, action, and sex. Altogether, fun and reliable reads. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd4556e4c55a81480d7f5ad358874796b62ca49","amp;dn":"Dawn+Complete+%5Bh33t%5D+%5BAlieneye%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd4556e4c55a81480d7f5ad358874796b62ca49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,212,85,110,76,85,168,20,128,215,245,173,53,136,116,121,107,98,202,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
