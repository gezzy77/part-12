As Marlene attempts to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcatch upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ over the course of one long and confusing night, Denis delivers an uncondescending and utterly convincing depiction of teenage longing, rendering her heroineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s misadventures with compassion and genuine insight.\n\nFile Size: 733,999,104 bytes \nRuntime: 1:07:40\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.1.0 Final \nFrame Size: 640x400 [=1.600] \nFPS: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate: 1328 kb/s \nBits per Pixel: 0.207 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[] \nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nSample Rate: 48000 Hz \nAudio bitrate: 106 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio \nInterleave: 40 ms \nNo. of audio streams: 1\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b1832ac3557f5b7d17727eeb9a3617e87e50768","amp;dn":"US+Go+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b1832ac3557f5b7d17727eeb9a3617e87e50768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,24,50,172,53,87,245,183,209,119,39,238,185,163,97,126,135,229,7,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
