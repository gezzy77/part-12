This high-quality rendition includes all of the original image and question content from the original disc, which is basically impossible to obtain now. Although originally published 20 years ago, Histology Image Review is still an extremely useful reference for medical and health sciences students today.\r\n\r\nOpen index.html in your web browser to get started.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nOriginal Description\r\n====================\r\n\r\nHistology is an image intensive subject. However, this should not necessitate studentsâ€™ memorization of illustrated material and associated questions. Histology requires an organized approach to the recognition of the microscopic anatomy of tissues and a strong knowledge base concerning the structure and function of those tissues.\r\n\r\nHistology ImageReview was created with the purpose of providing students with a systematic review of cell and tissue biology and organ histology. It offers several different magnifications of a structure, tissue or organ as if the student were using a microscope in the histology laboratory. We have compiled over 1200 images arranged in twenty chapters beginning with an introduction to histology and concluding with the organs of special sense. Both light and electron micrographs are included in the chapters. In addition, Histology ImageReview contains selected clinical correlations which augment basic histological information. Furthermore, the program provides a mechanism for self-assessment employing image-based questions and learning responses. The authors hope that the total package will enable students to develop a framework for study and review of histology that is based on understanding and recognition rather than rote memorization","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e85ed88c7618858555352157fac59389f9adc17f","amp;dn":"Histology+Image+Review","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e85ed88c7618858555352157fac59389f9adc17f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,94,216,140,118,24,133,133,85,53,33,87,250,197,147,137,249,173,193,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
