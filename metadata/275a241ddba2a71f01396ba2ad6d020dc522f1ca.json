At the Library\n02. Don't Leave Me\n03. I Was There\n04. Disappearing Boy\n05. Green Day\n06. Going to Pasalacqua\n07. 16\n08. Road To Acceptance\n09. Rest\n10. The Judge's Daughter\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD!!! I always make sure to seed my torrents to at least 6:1, often more (some are at 15:1+). But seeing torrents that originally had a lot of leechers are almost dead after a couple of weeks (I'm the only seeder left) just makes me sad. It limits my possibility to download and then upload new stuff here since a lot of my bandwidth goes to seeding those torrents. And it prevents people from downloading the stuff since I cannot always be there to seed.\n\nFor a better experience for you and others - please seed when you're done!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275a241ddba2a71f01396ba2ad6d020dc522f1ca","amp;dn":"Green+Day+-+39%2FSmooth+%5B1990%5D+MP3+V0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275a241ddba2a71f01396ba2ad6d020dc522f1ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,90,36,29,219,162,167,31,1,57,107,162,173,109,2,13,197,34,241,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
