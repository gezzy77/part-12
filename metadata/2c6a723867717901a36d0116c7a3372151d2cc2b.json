Released on 4 November 1991, Loveless was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991 in nineteen recording studios. While Loveless did not achieve great commercial success, the album was well received by critics. Widely regarded as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre, the record has been cited as an influence to several artists, and by critics as one of the best albums of the 1990s.\n\nAll songs written by Kevin Shields unless otherwise noted.\n\n01 Only Shallow (Bilinda Butcher, Shields) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n02 Loomer (Butcher, Shields) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n03 Touched (Colm Ãƒâ€œ CÃƒÂ­osÃƒÂ³ig) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:56\n04 To Here Knows When (Butcher, Shields) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:31\n05 When You Sleep Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n06 I Only Said Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:34\n07 Come in Alone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n08 Sometimes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:19\n09 Blown a Wish (Butcher, Shields) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n10 What You Want Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:33\n11 Soon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c6a723867717901a36d0116c7a3372151d2cc2b","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine-+%281991%29+Loveless++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c6a723867717901a36d0116c7a3372151d2cc2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,106,114,56,103,113,121,1,163,109,1,22,199,163,55,33,81,210,204,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
