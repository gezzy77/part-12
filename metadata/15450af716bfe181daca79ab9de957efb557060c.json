This text does more than simply explain dental anatomy; it links the anatomy to clinical practice, giving readers a stronger and more practical understanding of tooth structure and function, morphology, anatomy, and terminology. Chapters have been revised and reorganized into three partsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Comparative Tooth Anatomy, Application of Tooth Anatomy in Dental Practice, and Anatomic Structures of the Oral CavityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to make the material more accessible to dental hygiene programs.\n\nThe companion website offers Student Resources for an enhanced learning experience with an interactive image bank, image labeling exercises, and PowerPoint presentations. Instructor Resources include a test generator, an interactive image bank, PowerPoint presentations, and answers \n\n\n# Paperback: 520 pages\n# Publisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; Eighth edition (January 4, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1608317463\n# ISBN-13: 978-1608317462","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15450af716bfe181daca79ab9de957efb557060c","amp;dn":"Woelfel%5C%27s+Dental+Anatomy%3A+Its+Relevance+to+Dentistry+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15450af716bfe181daca79ab9de957efb557060c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,69,10,247,22,191,225,129,218,202,121,171,157,233,87,239,181,87,6,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
