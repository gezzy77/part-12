This interdisciplinary volume explores the dynamics of the bazaar with a number of case studies from Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Nablus, Bursa, Istanbul, Sana'a, Kabul, Tehran, and Yazd. Although they share some contextual and functional characteristics, each bazaar has its own unique and fascinating history, traditions, cultural practices, and structure. One of the most intriguing aspects revealed in this volume is the thread of continuity from past to present exhibited by the bazaar as a forum where a society meets and intermingles in the practice of goods exchange-a social and cultural ritual that is as old as human history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607289e2303e79fdc03d021477a20f0495510ba2","amp;dn":"The+Bazaar+in+the+Islamic+City+-+Design%2C+Culture%2C+and+History+%28A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607289e2303e79fdc03d021477a20f0495510ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,114,137,226,48,62,121,253,192,61,2,20,119,162,15,4,149,81,11,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
