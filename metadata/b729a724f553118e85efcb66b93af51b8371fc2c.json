It was released as a single on July 6, 2012, through Interscope Records. The song serves as the album's fifth single. &quot;National Anthem&quot; is a trip hop song that ties together elements of alternative hip hop, indie pop, and baroque pop. The music video for the song premiered on June 27, 2012. It is directed by Anthony Mandler. It depicts Del Rey as Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy and A$AP Rocky as John F. Kennedy.[1] It centers around the theme of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. Critical commentary accompanied the song and video. Positive reviews noted the song's critical evaluation of lavish lifestyles, saying it fit together with the lyrical structure of the entire album.\nAs with other tracks on Born to Die, &quot;National Anthem&quot; follows suit, produced in the alternative hip hop, trip hop, indie pop, and baroque pop genres. In the chorus, Del Rey half-sings, half-raps the line, &quot;Tell me IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m your national anthem/ Red! White! Blue!&quot;[2] At the close of the recording is a multi-layered narrative treatment.[2] The introduction features a sample of The Star-Spangled Banner as performed by Marilyn Monroe.\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 17.9 MiB\nDuration                                 : 7mn 48s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Born To Die The Paradise Edition\nAlbum/Performer                          : Lana Del Rey\nTrack name                               : National Anthem (Full Video Version)\nPerformer                                : Lana Del Rey\nGenre                                    : Indie Pop\nRecorded date                            : 2012\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98.4\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover description                        : thumbnail\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 7mn 48s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 17.9 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98.4\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b729a724f553118e85efcb66b93af51b8371fc2c","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+National+Anthem+%28Full+Video+Version%29+MP3+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b729a724f553118e85efcb66b93af51b8371fc2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,41,167,36,245,83,17,142,133,239,203,102,185,58,245,27,131,113,252,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
