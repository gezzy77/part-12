Fad is an American rap group from Rialto, California, whose name stood for Just, Jammin', Fresh And Def, and were backed by Clarence &quot;DJ Train&quot; Lars.\n\nJJ Fad was originally a six-member group out of Los Angeles in 1985. Its members were Juana Burns, Dania Birks, Michelle Franklin, Anna Cash, Fatima Shaheed, and Juanita Lee. The name JJ Fad actually was formed from the first names of the members. The six-member group released one song, 1987's &quot;Another Hoe,&quot; which took jabs at Roxanne Shante.\n\nDue to management and financial issues, Cash, Shaheed, and Lee left the group, leaving JJ Fad as a trio with DJ Train as their MC. \n\n\n\n\nSupersonic 1988\n\n\nSupersonic is a 1988 hip-hop album by J. J. Fad, released on Ruthless Records. The album was produced by Dr. Dre, DJ Yella and Arabian Prince, all members of N.W.A, and executively produced by Eric &quot;Eazy-E&quot; Wright (also of N.W.A). The album was distributed by Atco Records, a division of Atlantic Records. The title track was written by group members Dania Maria Birks and Juanita Michelle Burns-Sperling, former members Juanita A. Lee and Fatima Shasheed, and Kim Nazel.\n\nThe RIAA has certified the album as Platinum and singles released were the above mentioned title track (&quot;Supersonic&quot;), &quot;Way Out&quot; and &quot;Is It Love&quot;. &quot;Supersonic&quot; was the band's biggest pop hit and was ranked #76 in VH1's 2009 special &quot;100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s&quot;. In 2006, pop singer Fergie's smash-hit single &quot;Fergalicious&quot; sampled the title song along with Afro-Rican's &quot;Give It All You Got&quot;.\n\n&quot;Supersonic&quot; was mentioned by the group Teriyaki Boyz in their song &quot;Tokyo Drift&quot; from the The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift soundtrack. &quot;Supersonic&quot; was used in the dance game Dance Central 3.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Supersonic&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Way Out&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Blame It On The Muzick&quot;\n4.\t&quot;In The Mix&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Eenie Meenie Beats&quot;\n6.\t&quot;My Dope Intro&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Let's Get Hyped&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Now Really&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Time Tah Get Stupid&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Is It Love&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Just A Fad 1991\n\n\nNot Just a Fad is the second album by J.J.
