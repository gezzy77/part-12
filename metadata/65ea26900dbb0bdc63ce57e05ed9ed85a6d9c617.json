The music was recorded, though not released until 1971 as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live in SeattleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The results are nothing less than awesome.\n\nRecorded the next day were Ã¢â‚¬ËœOmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, still perhaps ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most controversial record, and, a fortnight later, Ã¢â‚¬ËœKulu SÃƒÂ© MamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSelflesnessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nBy the fall of 1965 the music had become a reflection of John Coltrane's spiritual quest, as well as his study of non-western religions and the ritualistic music that often accompanied these solemn rites. The effect of adding young firebrands Donald Garrett and Pharaoh Sanders to his ensemble was catalytic. \n\nThe enthusiasm of tenor maverick Sanders is contagious. On the sonic bookends &quot;Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Evolution,&quot; Sanders' unique command of multiphonics, harmonics and blow-torched overtones gives the music a real vocal impetus. On free interpretations of classics such as &quot;Out Of This World&quot; and &quot;Afro-Blue,&quot; Trane uses Sanders as his stunt double, allowing him to explore the farthest extremities of sound, by which time the innate structure and form of his own aural onslaughts sound positively lyrical in comparison.\n \nAs for Coltrane himself, whether he's leaving earth's orbit on &quot;Cosmos&quot; or turning &quot;Body And Soul&quot; into a free-form anthem, the searching, triumphant quality of his saxophone playing is emotionally overwhelming.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nLive in Seattle\n\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1971\n\n \n\n  2CDs / 1994 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n \n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\nCosmos\n\nOut of this World\n\nBody and Soul [#] (Bonus Track)\n\nTapestry in Sound\n\n\nTracklist / CD 2:\n\nEvolution\n\nAfro-Blue [#] [Incomplete Take] (Bonus Track)\n\n\nRecorded live at The Penthouse, Seattle, Washington on September 30, 1965\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohn Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€ tenor saxophone &amp; soprano saxophone\n\nPharoah Sanders Ã¢â‚¬â€ tenor saxophone\n\nMcCoy Tyner Ã¢â‚¬â€ piano\n\nJimmy Garrison Ã¢â‚¬â€ double bass\n\nDonald Garrett Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass clarinet &amp; double bass\n\nElvin Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\nLive in Seattle\nRecorded in 1965, released in 1971","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65ea26900dbb0bdc63ce57e05ed9ed85a6d9c617","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Live+in+Seattle+1965+%2F+1971+%28Impulse%21+1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65ea26900dbb0bdc63ce57e05ed9ed85a6d9c617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,234,38,144,13,187,11,220,99,206,87,224,94,217,237,133,166,217,198,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
