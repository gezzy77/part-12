The album is volume nine in Young's Archives Performance Series and the sixth to be released.\n\nThe album results from a tour following Young's recording what he later called the first Old Ways, an album of country music that his record company refused to release since they claimed it wasn't commercial enough. In this period, the early to mid-eighties, Young played music in many different genres. His backing band, the &quot;International Harvesters&quot;, consisted of professional country musicians from Nashville some of whom had also played (as &quot;The Shocking Pinks&quot;) on his rock and roll album Everybody's Rockin'. The album contains old Young songs and newer songs from Old Ways. It contains five previously unreleased songs (tracks 1, 5, 8, 11, and 12).\n\nAccording to Young, the album's name comes from Ben Keith. &quot;I hadn't heard these takes in 25 years, but when we unearthed them co-producer Ben Keith said, 'This is a treasure.'&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Amber Jean&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n    &quot;Are You Ready for the Country?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n    &quot;It Might Have Been&quot; (Ronnie Green &amp; Harriet Kane) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:59\n    &quot;Let Your Fingers Do the Walking&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n    &quot;Flying on the Ground Is Wrong&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n    &quot;Motor City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n    &quot;Soul of a Woman&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:28\n    &quot;Get Back to the Country&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:31\n    &quot;Southern Pacific&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:53\n    &quot;Nothing Is Perfect&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:02\n    &quot;Grey Riders&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:58\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abe26a17fd1474972f638298bf3025533a3bd093","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+A+Treasure+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abe26a17fd1474972f638298bf3025533a3bd093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,226,106,23,253,20,116,151,47,99,130,152,191,48,37,83,58,59,208,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
