Of course, any type of body weight exercise may be made progressively harder by adjusting leverage, range of motion, foot and/or hand positioning, and other such variables. Naturally, it is also possible to make exercises easier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is especially important if you are working around an old injury and want to build up your strength again in particular joints.
