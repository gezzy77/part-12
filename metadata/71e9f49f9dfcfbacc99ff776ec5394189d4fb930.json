This book presents the everyday foibles in the world of work with a view from the cubicle. Adams's voice sounds like the guy in the cubicle next to yours, who has learned to deal with the corporate bureaucracy while poking fun at it. With just the right touch of sarcasm in his reading, Adams will have you laughing while you're shouting, &quot;He's right!&quot; Adam's wins the Management Guru award hands down.\n\nInFo:\nFormat: MP3, 64kBit/s, 134 files\nDuration: 6.5 hours\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Dilbert Future - Scott Adams\nMove over, Faith Popcorn! Cartoonist Scott Adams is back in book form, and this time he gives Dilbert and his cronies a free hand to forecast the trends that just might drive business and society during the next millennium. In typical Adams fashion, The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century serves up a series of laugh-out-loud predictions on technology, marketing, work, jobs, gender relations, and even the future of democracy and capitalism.\n\nInFo:\nFormat: MP3, 56kBit/s, 64 files\nDuration: 1.2 hours\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Way Of The Weasel - Scott Adams\nSometimes laugh-out-loud funny and always irreverent, this presentation deflates every ego in sight with a wry and goofy read by Dilbert's creator. The corporate world is his main target, but anyone--and everyone--is game. Self-deprecating and occasionally using material that becomes laughable only at the last moment, Adams is a tightrope-walking jester having a fine time with us and himself. True to his weasel roots, Dilbert never actually makes an appearance on the recording. But for a refreshingly original laugh-fest you'll want to share with anyone possessing a job or a pulse, listen and learn THE WAY OF THE WEASEL.\n\nInFo:\nFormat: MP3, 32kBit/s, 18 files\nDuration: 2.7 hours\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLoads of audiobooks now available at the blog:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e9f49f9dfcfbacc99ff776ec5394189d4fb930","amp;dn":"Dilbert+Audiobooks+-+Scott+Adams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e9f49f9dfcfbacc99ff776ec5394189d4fb930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,233,244,159,157,252,251,172,201,159,247,118,236,83,148,24,157,79,185,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
