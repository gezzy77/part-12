A spin-off from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, each story was introduced by Freddy Krueger (played, as in the movies, by Robert Englund). This format is essentially the same as that employed by Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone. The pilot episode was directed by Tobe Hooper, and begins with Freddy Krueger's acquittal of the child-murdering charges due to his officer's lack of reviewing the Miranda warning at the time of Freddy's arrest. A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant (his workplace), leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\n\nSeason 1\n\n\n# 1- 1 9 Oct 88 No More Mr. Nice Guy\n# 1- 2 16 Oct 88 It's a Miserable Life\n# 1- 3 23 Oct 88 Killer Instinct\n# 1- 4 30 Oct 88 Freddy's Tricks and Treats\n# 1- 5 6 Nov 88 Judy Miller, Come On Down\n# 1- 6 13 Nov 88 Saturday Night Special\n# 1- 7 20 Nov 88 Sister's Keeper\n# 1- 8 27 Nov 88 Mother's Day\n# 1- 9 11 Dec 88 Rebel Without a Car\n# 1-10 18 Dec 88 The Bride Wore Red\n# 1-11 8 Jan 89 Do Dreams Bleed\n# 1-12 15 Jan 89 The End of the World\n# 1-13 29 Jan 89 Deadline\n# 1-14 5 Feb 89 Black Tickets\n# 1-15 12 Feb 89 School Daze\n# 1-16 19 Feb 89 Cabin Fever\n# 1-17 26 Feb 89 Love Stinks\n# 1-18 12 Mar 89 The Art of Death\n# 1-19 7 May 89 Missing Persons\n# 1-20 14 May 89 The Light At the End of the Tunnel\n# 1-21 21 May 89 Identity Crisis\n# 1-22 28 May 89 Safe Sex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb852f9b9be759026afdd4bc01e809f3dd2e28c3","amp;dn":"Freddy%5C%27s+Nightmares%3A+Season+1+TVRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb852f9b9be759026afdd4bc01e809f3dd2e28c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,133,47,155,155,231,89,2,106,253,212,188,1,232,9,243,221,46,40,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
