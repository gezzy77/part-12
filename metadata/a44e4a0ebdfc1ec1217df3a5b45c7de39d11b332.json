John rolls over to her and as things look like they are ready to take off, we hear, &quot;Cut!&quot; It's a film set loaded with lights, cameras and crew. Producer Peg Norton (Juliet Anderson) calls a break for lunch and the set clears. John tells Pam to hang back because he needs to talk to her, and before you know it they are fucking...er, I mean rehearsing. (Come on, this is a porn flick!)\n\nMeanwhile, on another stage, Peg's nerdy assistant Bill shows her the set that has just been completed for tomorrow's shoot. Peg nods in approval and suggests they rehearse the seduction scene. She lays Bill down and proceeds to give him a blowjob that lasts for about 30 seconds before he shoots all over her face. Peg is very disappointed but, thanks to movie magic (i.e. editing), Bill is still at full attention. This makes Peg happy again, and she proceeds to fuck him. This time he comes on her chest, if you want to call it coming. I swear that a single, tiny drop that you can barely see falls from his dick for his orgasm, but it is there!\n\nBack at the set, John and Pam are still at it. John fucks her in various positions until finally they decide anal would be a good idea. I have not been able to figure out the name of the actor that plays Pam but she has the hairiest asshole I've ever seen and really enjoys the anal pounding John gives her. The scene ends with John's trademark facial.\n\nAfter a hard days work, Peg relaxes at home and reads a letter sent to her from her niece Sheila (Sharon Kane) in Michigan. She wants to come to Hollywood to visit her on a film set. Peg begins reminiscing about the last time she visited Michigan - her brother-in-law Jack (Michael Morrison) sits on a vibrating chair as Peg sits next to him. Before you know it, she has him kissing her and his hands are on her breasts. From the doorway, Sheila secretly watches as Peg does a striptease and spreads for Jack. Seconds later, thanks to movie magic again, they are on a bed and completely naked. They give each other oral, and Sheila is so turned on by her aunt and fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actions that she runs to her bedroom, grabs her boyfriend, and goes down on him to his (happy) surprise. The two scenes are then intercut in standard Golden Age style. Sheila receives oral from her boyfriend before they fuck in the missionary position. He comes pretty quickly once that starts. Back in the other room, Aunt Peg and Jack get on some very hot sex that would even turn Gloria Steinem on. Juliet Anderson really knows how to work it. She controls the scene and milks it for everything it's worth (in more ways than one). Jack climaxes all over Peg's legs (no pun intended) as she ends the scene uniquely with a footjob.\n\nThe fantasy ends and Peg leaves her study. In the next room, she looks in the mirror and begins to reminisce again. This time she remembers a stay at a luxurious hotel. She and a slightly chubby, dark-haired girlfriend invite a waiter from room service into their suite. As he presents wine to them they ask him if it's true what they say about black men. I honestly had no idea this guy was black. He's so light skinned that he appears about as black as Tom Cruise would with a lighter hair color! Anyways, he laughs it off but they persist. They pull out his penis and give him oral together. Then they undress each other, complementing their bodies and copping feels the whole time. They proceed to fuck the shit out of him and one another in one of the hottest threesomes I've seen in a long time. There is no anal or anything kinky, the scene is short, and the facial at the end is very, very weak but the sex is really unbelievable. The energy in this scene could power all the video booths in Times Square for a week. (Not the Disney one of today either, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m talking 1988 Times Square!)\n\nBack at her house, Peg has grown horny from all this fantasizing. She gets in the shower and masturbates to orgasm.\n\nA few days later, famous European director Franco (Jamie Gillis) talks with Peg about directing her next production. They walk on set to find Seka (played by Seka!) rehearsing for the part of Alice. Franco asks to see her body, for the sake of the part of course. She strips and Franco touches her breasts to see how relaxed she will be during the love scenes. Franco drops to his knees and orally stimulates her, to see if she can handle it. Satisfied that she might work out, Franco suggests they practice the love scene right then. Peg agrees but says she must also have a part. He agrees and the three of them bust into a threesome with fucking and sucking until Franco weakly comes. This come volume is pathetic, maybe three small drops. (Was there a come shortage during the time of production? ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing about it in the history books, but I suspect something foul was amiss.) Overall, it's a below average fuck scene that really seems out of place with the other great ones in this film. (You might want to skip it.)\n\nSome time later, Peg is in her office auditioning actor Michael Ranger (played by Michael Ranger!) for the part of Kenny in her film. She has him sit on the couch and unzips his pants. During the blowjob that follows, Michael says, &quot;You give good head.&quot; &quot;One of the advantages of being the boss,&quot; she replies. The obvious sexual harassment he's fallen victim to doesn't damper Michael's spirits as he enjoys the attention. Susan (Serena), Peg's secretary, comes in and takes over while Peg undresses. They end up using and abusing Michael in the fuck session that follows until he finally gives a healthy money shot all over the place. This scene is a good one deserving a spot in the better classic compilation videos. Also of note for porn music lovers, halfway into this scene the background music suddenly changes to a song called 'Green Door Fantasy' that is originally from the classic adult film Sex World.\n\nThe end of the film has Peg in her limo picking up her niece Sheila from the San Francisco Airport. Peg lives in Hollywood and Sheila is coming to visit Hollywood so the logic behind picking her up in San Fran is beyond my understanding. (Obviously the film was shot in San Francisco and they just said it was LA, a la movie magic. They couldn't fake an airport so they simply made Peg drive to San Fran to pick her up! Should have just had the film set in San Fran but then how do you explain Hollywood? Sloppy screenwriting either way. Whatever - who cares besides me, right?)\n\nIn the car Sheila tells Peg she saw her with her father the last time she visited. Peg apologizes but Sheila says she doesn't mind at all. In fact, it made her &quot;all wet down there.&quot; Peg comments on how much she's grown and how mature she looks for her age. Sheila says she is only sixteen but all the boys say she looks older (and yes, she does look much older). Peg asks to see her breasts and she shows them. Peg licks them and Sheila enjoys it. She returns the favor. Then Peg tries to look at her pussy. Out of the blue, Sheila gets nervous. She says she doesn't think it's right. Peg coerces her into letting her lick it. Sheila enjoys it with a side of guilt. Sheila returns the favor to Peg, and they agree that it will be a great visit. You bet it will be! Unfortunately the film ends here, but I can imagine!\n\nConclusion\nJuliet Anderson was 41 years old when she starred as Aunt Peg and I've never seen 41 look so good. Aunt Peg is the character she is most remembered for and for good cause. Throughout the review I always talk about Aunt Peg fucking people, never them fucking her. She is a very strong character and in every sex scene she's in, she's the one in control. She's an aggressive female who takes control of her life and does as she pleases - an ultra modern feminist years before her time if you will. It's really a shame we don't see characters like this one in mainstream movies. If someone wanted to find a porn with socially redeeming value, they would need to look no further than Aunt Peg. Though it does have its flaws and slow moments (including the shitty sex scene with Franco &amp; Seka), overall it is a great film. Also of note, the resemblance between the Sharon Kane and Juliet Anderson is uncanny. I can totally believe that they are related (in reality, they are not), and it adds a sense of realism that heightens the sensuality between them. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll wish you had an aunt like Aunt Peg. The good definitely outweighs the bad here. Juliet Anderson should be proud! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44e4a0ebdfc1ec1217df3a5b45c7de39d11b332","amp;dn":"Classic+X+-+Aunt+Peg+%5B1980%5D+-+anal%2C+Juliet+Anderson%2C+Donna+Hart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44e4a0ebdfc1ec1217df3a5b45c7de39d11b332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,78,74,14,189,252,30,193,33,125,243,165,180,92,125,227,157,17,179,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
