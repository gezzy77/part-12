This textbook assumes no programming language experience. The writing is nontechnical and emphasizes good programming practices. The examples are business examples; they do not assume mathematical background beyond high school business math. Additionally, the examples illustrate one or two major points; they do not contain so many features that students become lost following irrelevant and extraneous details.\n\nAs with most college text books, this retails usually for about $120, which is criminal imho.  Enjoy sticking it to the man!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350b42015483dc235203dcb9836049a166716e66","amp;dn":"An+Object+Oriented+Approach+to+Programming+Logic+and+design+3rd+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350b42015483dc235203dcb9836049a166716e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,11,66,1,84,131,220,35,82,3,220,185,131,96,73,161,102,113,110,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
