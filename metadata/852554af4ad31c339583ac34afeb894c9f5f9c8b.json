In addition, this new collection features online play, leaderboards, achievements and trophies. \n\n# New Video Display option &quot;Stretch&quot; that fills a HDTV. The screenshots in this article demonstrate this new feature.\n\n# Audio glitches like MK2's attract mode, Scorpion's Voice, etc now sound proper. Audio issues still remain, but many have been improved. For example Scorpion's Voice on UMK3 can be heard when throwing the spear.\n\n# Online has player names on each side of the screen in the selection, loading screens and during games.\n\n# Online is MUCH improved. So far only been able to play against European players due to it being released over there only so far and it is quite smooth despite the long distance. Immediately feels different, no more like you are playing in molasses. Here's a quick video showing how fast online is now, hope to get a longer video up soon but having technical difficulties.\n\n# Unpausing the game no longer leaves you unable to move for a few seconds\n\n# You can use UKKs in UMK3 online now.\n\n\n\n# The &quot;Arcade&quot; Filter has more even scanlines when in &quot;Stretched&quot; mode, but in other modes retains it's uneven scan line arrangement from previous release.\n\n# The video \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; level was reduced resulting in a less washed out colors.\n\nBEFORE:\n\n\n\nAFTER:\n\n\n\n# Unfortunately they didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t put in version restrictions on the matchmaking, so if you get matched against a 1.02 player from Europe or a 1.01 player in the US right now you get a nasty black screen. This problem should go away once 1.02 is sent out worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nTested and working Win7 x64 SP1\n\nInstall instructions\n\n1: Unpack\n2: Install\n3: Enjoy \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852554af4ad31c339583ac34afeb894c9f5f9c8b","amp;dn":"Mortal+Kombat+Arcade+Kollection+v1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852554af4ad31c339583ac34afeb894c9f5f9c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,37,84,175,74,211,28,51,149,131,172,52,175,235,137,76,159,95,156,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
