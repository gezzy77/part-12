This book shows Java programmers how to develop applications utilizing relational database technologies with examples using Oracle and MySQL and the GlassFish application development framework and deployment platform all based on Java EE.\n\nThe book explains in detail how you can organize your Java EE solution into a multilayer architecture, placing most emphasis on how to implement the persistence and database tiers of an application.\nThrough many examples, this book shows how you can efficiently use the Java Persistence features available in the Java EE platform. Find out how you can greatly simplify the task of building the persistence layer of your Java EE application by moving some application logic into the underlying database, utilizing database views, stored programs, and triggers.\nThe book also explains how to deploy Java EE applications to GlassFish, a free, open source Java EE 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“compliant application server.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b149dcdc43807959f1463fb8879bb36101cae5e9","amp;dn":"Beginning+Database-Driven+App+Development+in+Java+EE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b149dcdc43807959f1463fb8879bb36101cae5e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,73,220,220,67,128,121,89,241,70,63,184,135,155,179,97,1,202,229,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
