Until now, if one partition came up short on free space, the only option you had was to delete one of the partitions, adjust the partition size, and then reinstall the deleted OS. To solve this problem, Paragon Software developed CampTuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢.\n\n\nN.B.:\nThis thing works like a charm. No serial required provided you don\\'t register and don\\'t ask for support. Tested on Leopard and Snow Leopard.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTHIS RUNS ON THE MAC SIDE, and NOT ON THE WINDOWS (BOOTCAMP) SIDE !\n\n!!!! BEFORE YOU OPEN THE DMG and FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON IT, YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:\n\n1) Be absolutely sure to do a permissions AND any disk repairs on your Mac startup disk (for disk repair you\\'ll need your Mac OS install DVD).\n\n2) Restart in Windows and run CHKDSK. If you don\\'t know how to do this just type CHKDSK in the HELP field in any Windows version from XP on up.\n\n3) Once this is done, restart under Mac OS and open the Paragon Camp Tune 8 file (Paragon-158-PEE_MacInstall_10.0.99.10022_000.dmg) and follow the instructions. You will need a blank CD to complete the task.\n\n\nDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRY TO REPARTION YOU MAC STARTUP/BOOTCAMP PARTITION USING APPLE\\'S DISK UTILITY! IF YOU DO, YOU WILL DESTROY THE BOOT BLOCKS ON THE WINDOWS SIDE (sometimes repairable but believe me, you don\\'t want to go through it!)\n\nENYOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2477269a6f164ae1785c4d34281b54fc3b312e19","amp;dn":"Paragon+Camp+Tune+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2477269a6f164ae1785c4d34281b54fc3b312e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,119,38,154,111,22,74,225,120,92,77,52,40,27,84,252,59,49,46,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
