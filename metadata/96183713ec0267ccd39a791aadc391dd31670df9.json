The two-disc album is groundbreaking among soundtrack releases in that it includes separate discs for the film's songs and the score, whereas most films release the songs and the score as two single-disc albums.\n\nThe album's lead single was &quot;Sleeping Awake&quot; by P.O.D. The song's lyrics and video refer to elements of the film.\n\n( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded:_The_Album ) \n\n* Disc Information\n\nLabel: Maverick, Warner Sunset Records\nCatalog#: 9362-48411-2, 9362-48411-2\nFormat: 2 x CD, Compilation, Enhanced, Promo\nCountry: Europe\nReleased: 05 May 2003\nGenre: Electronic, Rock, Stage &amp; Screen\nStyle: Alternative Rock, Breakbeat, Modern Classical, Soundtrack \n\n* Tracklist\n\n\t* Disc 1\n\n01 - Linkin Park - Session - 2:23  \t\n\t* Mixed By - Andy Wallace\n  \t* Producer - Don Gilmore , Linkin Park\n  \t* Written-By - Linkin Park\n02 - Marilyn Manson - This Is The New Shit - 4:20 \t\n  \t* Co-producer, Mixed By - Ben Grosse\n  \t* Producer, Arranged By, Recorded By - Marilyn Manson , Tim Skold\n  \t* Written-By - John5 , Marilyn Manson , Tim Skold\n03 - Rob Zombie - Reload - 4:25 \t\n  \t* Engineer - Frank Gryner\n  \t* Remix - Charlie Clouser\n  \t* Written-By, Producer - Rob Zombie , Scott Humphrey\n04 - Rob Dougan - Furious Angels - 5:29 \t\n  \t* Mixed By, Producer [Additional] - Pete Craige\n  \t* Orchestrated By, Conductor - Nick Ingman\n  \t* Written-By, Producer - Rob Dougan\n05 - Deftones - Lucky You - 4:08 \t\n  \t* Producer - Deftones , Terry Date\n  \t* Written-By - Deftones\n06 - Team Sleep - The Passportal - 2:55 \t\n  \t* Producer - Terry Date\n  \t* Written-By - Chino Moreno\n07 - P.O.D. - Sleeping Awake - 3:23 \t\n  \t* Mixed By - Chris Lord-Alge\n  \t* Producer - Howard Benson\n  \t* Recorded By - Mike Plotnikoff\n  \t* Written-By - P.O.D.\n08 - ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“nloco - Bruises - 2:36 \t\n  \t* Producer, Mixed By - Mudrock\n \t* Written-By - ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“nloco\n09 - Rage Against The Machine - Calm Like A Bomb - 4:58 \t\n  \t* Written-By - Brad Wilk , Tim Commerford , Tom Morello , Zack de la Rocha\n10 - Oakenfold - Dread Rock - 4:40 \t\n  \t* Engineer, Programmed By - Ian Green\n  \t* Producer - Paul Oakenfold\n  \t* Written-By - Ian Green , Paul Oakenfold\n11 - Fluke - Zion - 4:33 \t\n  \t* Written-By, Producer - Fluke\n12 - Dave Matthews Band - When The World Ends (Oakenfold Remix) - 5:26 \t\n\t* Producer - Glen Ballard\n  \t* Remix - Paul Oakenfold\n  \t* Written-By - David J.
