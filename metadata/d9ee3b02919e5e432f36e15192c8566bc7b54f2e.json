It's a great book that seems to have become largely forgotten. It's likely that you actually have to concentrate, suspend a bit of disbelief and deal with a good deal of heavy, dark themes to really get into it. Not sure, but for me, I'm giving it a &quot;Recommended&quot;.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssues 1-4 of 'Crush'\n\nAeon, 1995-1996, 27-36 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Burpo\n\nI don't know exactly how to describe this book and I can't find a blurb. Dystopian surrealistic futurism? It's dark, genuinely disturbing in a few places, and if you let it, it will completely envelope you... then leave you feeling slightly confused and needing a shower.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ee3b02919e5e432f36e15192c8566bc7b54f2e","amp;dn":"Crush+%28Aeon%2C+1995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ee3b02919e5e432f36e15192c8566bc7b54f2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,238,59,2,145,158,94,67,47,54,225,81,146,200,86,107,199,181,79,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
