Born into a musical family, he is talented in piano and violin and once lived abroad in the music capitals of the world as a young boy (namely Prague), but is trapped in Japan because of his childhood phobia of airplanes and the ocean. In contrast, Megumi Noda, or &quot;Nodame&quot;, is a piano student at Momogaoka, notorious for messiness and eccentric behavior. Despite being very talented, Nodame prefers to play by ear rather than according to the musical score; thus, she is regarded as sloppy and playful.\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/jap\nQuality: Medium/High\nFormat: .mkv\nSize/ep: 80Mb +/-\nSubs: Eng\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7a3ca1988328f4b73c37e9102c24a8de4026b9","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DNodame+Cantabile+1-23+Complete+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7a3ca1988328f4b73c37e9102c24a8de4026b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,122,60,161,152,131,40,244,183,60,55,233,16,44,36,168,222,64,38,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
