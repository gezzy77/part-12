Through the script, the author, a young \nunknown named Abbas Karam Younis, seems to implicate himself in the \ndeath of his ailing wife and the disclosure to the police of his mother, \na prostitute, and his father, a gambler. Then Abbas mysteriously vanishes, \nleaving behind a suicide note but no corpse. Previously published here \nin a limited edition, this 1981 novel by the Egyptian Nobel laureate \nadopts the Faulkneresque device of employing a different character to \nnarrate each chapter. All four accounts are marked by a deft blend of \neveryday details of Cairo life and compelling, stream-of-consciousness \nmonologues. &quot;Abbas could never betray his mother,&quot; she muses at one \npoint. &quot;He may have scorned everything else, but not my love. Love is \nstronger than evil itself.&quot; Throughout, Mahfouz probes the nature of \nart: what is real, what is fantasy. &quot;A play is just a play. Nothing \nmore,&quot; one character says. &quot;Otherwise, the law would have the right \nto put ninety percent of our authors in the prisoner's dock.&quot; This transcendent \nbook is evidence of how well Mahfouz's penetrating stories travel across \ncultural borders.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca2a505836b84b2f375e5ee52c23b32a20d4563","amp;dn":"Wedding+Song+by+Naguib+Mahfouz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca2a505836b84b2f375e5ee52c23b32a20d4563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,162,165,5,131,107,132,178,243,117,229,238,82,194,59,50,162,13,69,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
