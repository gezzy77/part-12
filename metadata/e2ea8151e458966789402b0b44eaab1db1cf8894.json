That's a load of crap so I am eliminating that for you all and giving you a clean set of files.\n\nThis is a full working copy of Vector Magic that I have been using for several weeks and it's great, it's passed all scans on my system and has just been outstanding to date.\n\nHere it is with all the information you will need to install and use in the included short but sweet readme.txt\n\nI didn't include the 64bit files simply because not many people will ever use it so no sense in it. Just follow the instructions and you'll be golden.\n\n\nEnjoy,\nBone\n\n\nPS: This is my first torrent ever that I have uploaded.\n\nAlso I'm not sure how to add more trackers to this torrent file so if you know the tracker addresses please let me know so I can add them to this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ea8151e458966789402b0b44eaab1db1cf8894","amp;dn":"Vector+Magic+Desktop+Edition_Win+32bit+1.08.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ea8151e458966789402b0b44eaab1db1cf8894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,234,129,81,228,88,150,103,137,64,43,11,68,234,171,29,177,207,136,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
