Could this mean the end of his dirty magazine fetish? Trouble is, she&amp;#039;s only 19 and 19.5 years ago Del was pretty friendly with her mum June.\n\nStrained Relations:\n\nGrandads funeral brings relations from as far as North London, including Uncle Albert who&amp;#039;s intentions leave Del feeling &amp;#039;like a turkey who&amp;#039;s caught Bernard Matthews grinning at him&amp;#039;\n\nHole In One:\n\nRodney&amp;#039;s non-too-shrewd investment in suntan oil during &amp;#039;the worst winter in two million years&amp;#039; demands emergency measures and Uncle Albert decides its time to display his only talent - that of falling down holes without any real injury.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s Only Rock N Roll:\n\nInstead of the Albert &amp;#039;all, Rodneys pop group were heading for &amp;#039;sod all&amp;#039; until Del discovered their commercial potential. As usual, it doesn&amp;#039;t quite work out like they&amp;#039;d like.\n\nSleeping Dogs Lie:\n\nDel is onto a great new money making scheme - looking after Marlene and Boycies new puppy Duke for a steal at Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£60 a week should be a doddle.... a bit of the old pedigree chum and they should be away. Then Duke falls victum to salamonella poisoning.\n\nWatching The Girls Go By:\n\nRodders is desperate to find a woman for a party at the Nags Head. Nothing new? This time he&amp;#039;s got a bet on with Mickey and Del&amp;#039;s gonna make sure he wins..\n\nAs One Door Closes:\n\nWhen the bottom falls out of the louvre doors, times get hard for the Trotters. But nature will find a way as Del and Rodders go butterfly collecting.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447ddce8ba2a329f2cddd15b2438b150db65729a","amp;dn":"Only.Fools.And.Horses.Complete.Series4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447ddce8ba2a329f2cddd15b2438b150db65729a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,125,220,232,186,42,50,159,44,221,209,91,36,56,177,80,219,101,114,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
