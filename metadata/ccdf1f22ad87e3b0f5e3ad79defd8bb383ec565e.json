Noel Rosa is a funny guy with a twisted chin from the district of Vila Isabel. Middle-class and white, he writes poems and plays in a local band. He studies medicine but prefers the friendship of black guys from the favelas, factory girls and hookers. His friend Ismael Silva, a composer, introduces him to the world of samba and when challenged to compose he writes Com que roupa?, a parody of the Brazilian national anthem which becomes a magnificent success. He flies through the golden age of radio like a comet, changing the direction of Brazilian popular music. Between declarations of love and samba duels, the irreverent composer follows an intense rhythm until an overpowering illness complicates his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdf1f22ad87e3b0f5e3ad79defd8bb383ec565e","amp;dn":"Noel.Poeta.da.Vila.DVDRip.XviD-pedr1nho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdf1f22ad87e3b0f5e3ad79defd8bb383ec565e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,223,31,34,173,135,227,176,245,227,173,121,222,253,139,179,131,236,86,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
