But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Johnson) has been \n\ntracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command \n\nrevealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs \n\nasks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.\n\n[/size][/b]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/6k507pa80ph6mhtfmcak.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/6k507pa80ph6mhtfmcak.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/gvr2x0ri87vba8ana4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/gvr2x0ri87vba8ana4.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/wv6vrckp9n3hvvk9bwrk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/wv6vrckp9n3hvvk9bwrk.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/do61x9ks689hy0akkn3p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/do61x9ks689hy0akkn3p.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/tby3unmf6v5f9l8pe8h5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/tby3unmf6v5f9l8pe8h5.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/a3d3drvx0s5447guz7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/a3d3drvx0s5447guz7.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/bo05dg1tfpt9ajgwl3lo.pngg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/bo05dg1tfpt9ajgwl3lo.pngg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/pr4u7hdyzecf0khvke2e.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/pr4u7hdyzecf0khvke2e.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/np3ibxt2wd9fvrd6l7k3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/np3ibxt2wd9fvrd6l7k3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\n\n    Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto: A street racer and fugitive.\n\n    Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner: A former FBI agent turned criminal.
