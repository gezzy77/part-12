Not getting the best of reviews but here it is anyway.\n\n\nDescription: The fires are out, but the trouble's just beginning for the treecats \n\n    On pioneer planet Sphinx, ruined lands and the approach of winter force the now Landless Clan to seek new territory. They have one big problemÃ¢â‚¬â€there's nowhere to go. Worse, their efforts to find a new home awaken the enmity of the closest treecat clanÃ¢â‚¬â€a stronger group who's not giving up a single branch without a fight \n\n    Stephanie Harrington, the treecats' greatest advocate, is off to Manticore for extensive trainingÃ¢â‚¬â€and up to her ears in challenges there. That leaves only Stephanie's best friends, Jessica and Anders, to save the treecats from themselves. And now a group of xenoanthropologists is once again after the great secret of the treecatsÃ¢â‚¬â€that they are intelligent, empathic telepathsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their agenda will lead to nothing less that treecat exploitation. \n\n    Finally, Jessica and Anders face problems of their own, including their growing attraction to one another. It is an attraction that seems a betrayal of Stephanie Harrington, the best friend either of them have ever had.
