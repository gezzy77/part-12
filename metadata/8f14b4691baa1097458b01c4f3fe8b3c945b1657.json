Guitarist Eddie Van Halen redefined what the electric guitar could do, developing a blindingly fast technique with a variety of self-taught two-handed tapping, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and effects that mimicked the sounds of machines and animals. It was wildly inventive and over the top, equaled only by vocalist David Lee Roth, who brought the role of a metal singer to near-performance art standards. Roth wasn't blessed with great technique, unlike Eddie, but he had a flair for showmanship derived as much from lounge performers as Robert Plant. Together, they made Van Halen into the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the late '70s and early '80s, and in the process set the template for hard rock and heavy metal for the '80s.\n\n\nAll six original albums that Van Halen recorded with David Lee Roth are all remastered and included in this set: Van Halen, Van Halen II, Women &amp; Children First, Fair Warning, Diver Down and 1984.\n\nThe remastered CDs are a MUST-HAVE for all Van Halen fans! The sound quality is far superior to the original CDs. The remastered CDs contain ALL the original artwork that was contained in the 12&quot; vinyl releases, unlike the original CDs. Even the printing quality of the photos and the liner notes is far superior to the original CDs.\n\n\nVan Halen (1978)\n\n1. Runnin' With The Devil\n2. Eruption\n3. You Really Got Me\n4.
