Such a weird, scary sound as always. God I love this man. The cover is\n  also creepy as hell, and an homage to Abu Garib. Do yourself a favour and buy\n  this! Definite top 10 of 2013 material, he has really outdone himself here.\n  Think of me when you blaze to this &lt;3\n\n  &quot;While this album remains committed to a painterly form of musical\n  abstraction, it's also a record of restrained composition recorded live\n  primarily in intimate studio rooms, employing woodwinds, piano &amp; synthesizers\n  towards an effort at doing what digital music does not do naturally - making\n  music that is out of time, out of tune &amp; out of phase.&quot; &lt;- well written. very\n  true.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
