However he does not have any special power except for his broad knowledge, sharp insight, and impeccable instinct about &quot;MOE&quot; and its products, from manga to anime to games to light novel to figures. One day he found himself transported to a fantasy world where elves live and dragons fly. And he is given a taskÃ¢â‚¬â€not to fight monster or embark on a quest, but to enhance cultural exchange by becoming a &quot;moe missionary&quot; in this fantasy world! He meets a palace guard who has a bit of fujoshi taste, a half-elf maid, and the empress who is a little girl. He comes up with the idea of building a school. At first it runs as a comedy but later there are serious matters that Shinichi needs to face: ethnic discrimination, social problems, conflict with neighboring countries, sabotage by opposition elements including Japanese government, etc. Can he overcome the obstacles, successfully bring &quot;moe&quot; culture to the fantasy world, and help the people there as well?\n\nRead more at http://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company#VZLoGha2HtDpgyuw.99\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e1a96ba33967b8bc530b522e31da73a625983da","amp;dn":"%5BAnime-Koi%5D+Outbreak+Company+1-12+%5Bh264-720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e1a96ba33967b8bc530b522e31da73a625983da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,26,150,186,51,150,123,139,197,48,181,34,227,29,167,58,98,89,131,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
