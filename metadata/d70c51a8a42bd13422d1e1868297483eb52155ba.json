The track selection treads much of the same ground as \n\nthe 2004 release Ultimate Alabama, with that collection boasting four more tracks, including the essential hits ?Forty Hour Week (For a Livin?)? and ?Tennessee \n\nRiver.?   The big problem with cataloging Alabama using the ?hits? standard is that it ends up excluding their signature track ?My Home?s in Alabama?, which \n\nwasn?t a huge chart hit but remains one of their most beloved songs.    If those three tracks had been used in place of some of the lesser-quality hits here, \n\nyou?d have a collection that was a lot closer to indispensable.  As it is, this one is still a good value, but it isn?t the definitive single-disc set that the band \n\ndeserves.\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    Alabama\n? Title:     16 Biggest Hits\n?
