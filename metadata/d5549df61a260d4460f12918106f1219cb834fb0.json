Focused and clearly written, Medical Physiology: A Systems Approach details the major physiological processes involved in both health and disease. Each chapter begins with a list of Objectives, includes Key Concepts, and ends with Study Questions designed to test your knowledge of major concepts covered in that chapter. Most chapters also include Clinical Correlations that reinforce the major physiological principles covered and illustrate their importance to understanding disease states.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5549df61a260d4460f12918106f1219cb834fb0","amp;dn":"Medical+Physiology+-+A+Systems+Approach+by+Hershel+Raff%2C+Michael","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5549df61a260d4460f12918106f1219cb834fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,84,157,246,26,38,13,68,96,241,41,24,16,111,18,25,203,131,79,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
