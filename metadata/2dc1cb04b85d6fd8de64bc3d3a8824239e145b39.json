Miles Davis opened for Neil Young and Crazy Horse and The Steve Miller Blues Band for two nights at the Fillmore East, March 6 &amp; 7 (Friday &amp; Saturday). There were two shows each night. Columbia recorded both nights, but for some reason they decided to issue only the music from Saturday's show.\n\nLeaning heavily on the soon-to-be-released Bitches Brew, these 2 shows capture Miles heading in the direction of Jack Johnson, stopping to give the rock audience a glimpse of himself working at another peak. As Miles said, this was &quot;a mother of a band&quot; - amongst his best.\n\nThe music is as exciting, revelatory, and dangerous today as it was on March 7, 1970. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about that time.\n\n\nMiles Davis Ã¢â‚¬Å½\n\nLive At The Fillmore East (March 7, 1970)\nIt's About That Time\n\n2001\n\n\n CD / 2001 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 / First Set:\n\n1 Directions\n\t\n2 Spanish Key\n\t\n3 Masqualero\n\t\n4 It's About That Time The Theme\t\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 / Second Set:\n\n1 Directions\n\t\n2 Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\n\t\n3 Bitches Brew\n\t\n4 Spanish Key \n\n5 It's About That Time Willie Nelson \n\nRecorded on March 7, 1970, at the Fillmore East, NYC\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nMiles Davis: trumpet\n\nWayne Shorter: soprano and tenor saxophone\n\nChick Corea: Fender Rhodes electric piano\n\nDave Holland: acoustic and electric bass\n\nJack DeJohnette: drums\n\nAirto Moreira: percussion\n\n\nMiles Davis Ã¢â‚¬Å½\nLive At The Fillmore East (March 7, 1970)\nIt's About That Time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dc1cb04b85d6fd8de64bc3d3a8824239e145b39","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+Fillmore+East+%28March+7%2C+1970%29+It%27s+About+That+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dc1cb04b85d6fd8de64bc3d3a8824239e145b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,193,203,4,184,93,111,216,222,100,188,61,58,136,36,35,158,20,91,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
