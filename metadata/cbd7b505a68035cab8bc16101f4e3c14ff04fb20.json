The birth of a daughter, alienation and depression in Norway, and subsequent separation from his wife and new child gave him plenty to mull over, work out, and serve up on 2007's Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? At first glance, longtime Of Montreal followers might throw up their arms in dismay as Barnes moves well away from the usual slice-of-life character studies he's made such good use of over the past few years - no pop-challenged London cabbies or paranoid senior citizens on Hissing. No sir. In fact, it's all about him - every stitch of it. It's Kevin Barnes trying to woo himself out of a deep funk, lashing out, or taking a dip in the self-pity pool. At first, it's an alarming listening experience. Where's the self-assured, polished pop maestro who made such a fine showing on the past two albums? He took one hell of a beating, that's for sure. The Kevin Barnes heard here has a bone to pick, issues to work out, and a big chip on his shoulder. The music and production reflect this as much as the lyrical content.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd7b505a68035cab8bc16101f4e3c14ff04fb20","amp;dn":"of+Montreal+-+Hissing+Fauna%2C+Are+You+the+Destroyer%3F+%282007%29+%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd7b505a68035cab8bc16101f4e3c14ff04fb20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,215,181,5,166,128,53,202,184,188,22,16,31,78,60,20,255,4,251,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
