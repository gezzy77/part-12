With the help his partner Sanchez (and often against the wishes of his superior officers), Assy patrols the streets of Exeter, New Hampshire. Assy McGee is a walking, talking lower torso with exposed buttocks. Horribly violent and clinically depressed, Assy is a parody of the 1970s/1980s movie cops as seen in such films as Dirty Harry, Lethal Weapon and Cobra: trigger-happy, tough, at times hopelessly depressed, and in conflict with his fellow officers as often as he is in conflict with crime. Assy has a slurred style of speech similar to Sylvester Stallone, though it is far more muffled, possibly due to his anatomy or inebriation (or both). He also quotes and mimics some of Stallone's most memorable characters, shouting Judge Dredd's catch phrase &quot;I am the law!&quot; in episode five &quot;Mexican Rain&quot; and reenacts the Rocky training scene in episode seven &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Sometimes, when out of breath, or even just peeved, Assy will flatulate.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assy_mcgee\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795065/\n\nCreators: Carl W. Adams, H.

And now, I may as well upload the complete collection, seasons 1-2, plus the only extra I could find: a commercial that aired before the show premiered. There is no word of whether AdultSwim plans to continue this series, so this may be all that we get. Naturally, I deleted the old torrent of this (which had the same exact files for season 1), to make way for this one. Enjoy!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Three.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406894a3c1fb71da329ecf3005cffd9cadbeee3e","amp;dn":"Assy+McGee+-+Seasons+1-2+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406894a3c1fb71da329ecf3005cffd9cadbeee3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,104,148,163,193,251,113,218,50,158,207,48,5,207,253,156,173,190,238,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
