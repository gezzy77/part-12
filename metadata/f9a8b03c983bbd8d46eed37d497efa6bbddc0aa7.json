That&amp;#039;s the curious gambit behind Geffen&amp;#039;s &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of Whiskeytown&amp;#039;s 1997 major-label debut, Strangers Almanac; while the original release of the album clocked in at a bit under 52 minutes, this reissue has been expanded into a two-disc set that&amp;#039;s nearly 148 minutes long. Strangers Almanac caught Whiskeytown in an awkward moment in their history; while they&amp;#039;d gained a far higher profile as a new major-label act and were pegged as rising stars, tensions within the band were already starting to fracture the lineup, and Ryan Adams, Phil Wandscher, and Caitlin Cary had to replace their rhythm section a mere two weeks before they began recording, with session musicians filling out the lineup. While Strangers Almanac&amp;#039;s fallow stretches hamper its pacing, the best material ranks alongside Whiskeytown&amp;#039;s finest moments, and the album sounds powerfully cohesive, with a real chemistry between Adams, Cary, and Wandscher that was absent from the group&amp;#039;s posthumous swan song Pneumonia. However, this new version of the LP seems to reflect one of the guiding credos of Adams&amp;#039; solo career, namely that Quantity Is Quality. Disc one of the Deluxe Strangers Almanac features the original 13-song album along with a five-song radio broadcast from the fall of 1997, with the band meandering through a sloppy live set that does feature two otherwise unreleased songs and a few inspired moments, but sounds as if Adams had awakened from a deep sleep two minutes before air time. Disc two features two rare tunes that popped up on film soundtracks (&quot;Wither, I&amp;#039;m a Flower&quot; from Hope Floats and &quot;Theme for a Trucker&quot; from The End of Violence) along with 19 alternate takes and demos that have circulated among fans under the title &quot;The Barn&amp;#039;s on Fire.&quot; Most of the disc two material is the sort of stuff that gets bootlegged but not given an authorized release for a reason ÃƒÂ¢?? they&amp;#039;re covers and alternate versions (usually acoustic) that obsessive fans will dote on, but few if any objective listeners would peg as being as interesting as the group&amp;#039;s authorized recordings. Sadly, this adequate but hardly compelling music has been included when some more interesting stuff didn&amp;#039;t make the cut ÃƒÂ¢?? the four-track promo EP In Your Wildest Dreams (where &quot;Wither I&amp;#039;m a Flower&quot; made its first appearance), and several compilation appearances and single sides (especially the group&amp;#039;s potent version on Moon Mullican&amp;#039;s &quot;Bottom of the Glass&quot; on the Bloodshot collection Straight Outta Boone County). Ultimately, this edition tends to dilute Strangers Almanac&amp;#039;s strengths rather than reinforcing them, which is a shame, as its one of the best and least acknowledged albums in Ryan Adams&amp;#039; pantheon. \n\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n                     Whiskeytown - Strangers Almanac\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n   Artist  : Whiskeytown\n   Album   : Strangers Almanac\n\n   Genre   : Rock\n   Label   : Geffen\n\n   Source  : CDDA\n   Size    : 192,4 MB\n\n   Quality : VBRkbps\n           : 44.1kHz\n           : Joint\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n   Tracklist:\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n         cd1\n\n   01    Inn Town                                                 05:51\n   02    Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight             03:16\n   03    Yesterday&amp;#039;s News                                         02:50\n   04    16 Days                                                  03:54\n   05    Everything I Do                                          04:32\n   06    Houses On The Hill                                       02:39\n   07    Turn Around                                              05:17\n   08    Dancing With The Women At The Bar                        04:38\n   09    Waiting To Derail                                        03:55\n   10    Avenues                                                  02:31\n   11    Losering                                                 04:01\n   12    Somebody Remembers The Rose                              02:30\n   13    Not Home Anymore                                         05:59\n   14    Houses On The Hill (Live)                                03:43\n   15    Nurse With The Pills (Live)                              04:41\n   16    I Don&amp;#039;t Care What You Think About Me (Live)              03:19\n   17    Somebody Remembers The Rose (Live)                       02:34\n   18    Turn Around (Live)                                       04:26\n\n         cd2\n\n   01    Indian Gown                                              04:46\n   02    16 Days (Acoustic)                                       03:13\n   03    Somebody Remembers The Rose (Acoustic)                   02:45\n   04    Avenues (Acoustic)                                       03:35\n   05    Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight (Acoustic)  02:43\n   06    Houses On The Hill (Early Version)                       02:26\n   07    My Heart Is Broken                                       03:05\n   08    I Still Miss Someone (Acoustic)                          02:24\n   09    Kiss &amp; Make-Up                                           03:31\n   10    Barn&amp;#039;s On Fire                                           01:43\n   11    Dancing With The Women At The Bar (Early Version)        04:28\n   12    Dreams                                                   05:50\n   13    Breathe                                                  04:08\n   14    Wither, I&amp;#039;m A Flower (From Hope Floats Soundtrack)       04:54\n   15    Luxury Liner                                             02:40\n   16    Theme For A Trucker (From The End Of Violence Soundtrack 04:29\n   17    Streets Of Sirens                                        03:45\n   18    Turn Around (Alternate Version)                          04:03\n   19    10 Seconds                                               04:15\n   20    Ticket Time (Early Version)                              03:54\n   21    The Rain Won&amp;#039;t Help You When It&amp;#039;s Over (Early Version)   04:34\n\n                                                   \n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n   Release Notes:\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n    STRANGERS ALMANAC was Whiskeytown&amp;#039;s penultimate album. The band \n    is still steeped in the sounds of country and Gram \n    Parsons-inspired country-rock here, but one can hear the music \n    moving toward the pop of their final effort PNEUMONIA. Everything \n    still centers around the voice and excellent songwriting of Ryan \n    Adams (who was still only 22 at the time of this album&amp;#039;s release).\n\n    The song &quot;16 Days,&quot; for example, with its breezy, open-road, \n    country vibe and the lovely interlocking harmonies between \n    Adams and violinist Caitlin Cary, was released as a single, \n    and rightfully so. There is also the beautiful, melancholic \n    weeper &quot;Dancing With the Women at the Bar,&quot; and a \n    revisitiation of &quot;Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart \n    Tonight,&quot; which appeared on the band&amp;#039;s debut. Adams&amp;#039;s talent \n    shines so brightly here, in fact, that it is little wonder he \n    would soon be pursuing a solo career (the internal tensions \n    in the band would hasten its dissolution as well), but \n    STRANGERS ALMANAC captures this fine, short-lived, \n    alt-country band in full effect.\n\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a8b03c983bbd8d46eed37d497efa6bbddc0aa7","amp;dn":"Whiskeytown-Strangers+Almanac+%28Deluxe+2CD-2008-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a8b03c983bbd8d46eed37d497efa6bbddc0aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,168,176,60,152,59,189,141,70,238,211,125,73,126,250,107,189,220,10,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
