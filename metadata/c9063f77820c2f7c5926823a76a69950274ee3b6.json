Meta tags that also play important role can be autogenerated (where supported) or entered manually (for all Joomla! URLs). JoomSEF fully supports UTF-8 and will work with non-latin URLs also. In cooperation with JoomFish, it supports URL translations and localization at multilingual sites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9063f77820c2f7c5926823a76a69950274ee3b6","amp;dn":"Artio+Joomsef+4.4.1+with+working+sitemap+generator+plus+Joomesf+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9063f77820c2f7c5926823a76a69950274ee3b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,6,63,119,130,12,47,124,89,38,130,58,118,166,153,80,39,78,227,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
