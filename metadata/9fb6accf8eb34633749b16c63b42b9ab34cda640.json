In a book that will encourage scholarly discussion for some time, David M. Schaps addresses a range of important coinage topics, among them money, exchange, and economic organization in the Near East and in Greece before the introduction of coinage; the invention of coinage and the reasons for its adoption; and the developing use of money to make more money.\n\nDavid M. Schaps is Professor of Classics at Bar-Ilan University in Israel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fb6accf8eb34633749b16c63b42b9ab34cda640","amp;dn":"The+Invention+of+Coinage+and+the+Monetization+of+Ancient+Greece","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fb6accf8eb34633749b16c63b42b9ab34cda640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,182,172,207,142,179,70,51,116,155,22,198,59,66,185,171,52,205,166,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
