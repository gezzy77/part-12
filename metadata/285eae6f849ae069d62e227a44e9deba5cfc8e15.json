Lead Raider Mark Lindsay still dominates this album like those that came before and after it, but the style is different than the rest.  \nIt combines hard rock with R &amp; B, soul, and even funk. It's also the first time female backup singers appeared on a Raiders album on some of the tracks...and that's a good thing, baby.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285eae6f849ae069d62e227a44e9deba5cfc8e15","amp;dn":"PAUL+REVERE+and+the+RAIDERS+--+Goin%27+to+Memphis+%28+1968+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285eae6f849ae069d62e227a44e9deba5cfc8e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,94,174,111,132,154,224,105,214,46,34,122,68,233,222,186,92,252,142,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
