During that time, two men served as the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal security team: Bill Whitfield, a former cop and veteran of the security profession, and Javon Beard, a brash, untested rookie, both single fathers themselves.\n\nStationed at his side nearly 24/7, their job was to see and hear everything that transpired, and to keep everyone else out, making them the only two men who know what 60 million fans around the world still want to know: What really happened to the King of Pop?\n\nDriven by a desire to show the world who Michael Jackson truly was, Whitfield and Beard have produced the only definitive, first-person account of Michael JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last years: the extreme measures necessary to protect Jackson and his family, the simple moments of happiness they managed to share in a time of great stress, the special relationship Jackson shared with his fans, and the tragic events that culminated in the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ill-fated comeback, This Is It. The truth is far more compelling than anything youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve yet heard.\n\nAn indispensable piece of pop-culture history, Remember the Time is the story of a man struggling to live a normal life under extraordinary circumstances, the story of a father fighting to protect and provide for his children. Remember the Time is the book that dismantles the tabloid myths once and for all to give Michael Jackson back his humanity.\n\nPublisher: Weinstein Books (June 3, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1602862508\nISBN-13: 978-1602862500","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be3f926d75401e51bcb9262f09b104ff5450eb5","amp;dn":"Remember+the+Time+Protecting+Michael+Jackson+in+His+Final+Days+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be3f926d75401e51bcb9262f09b104ff5450eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,227,249,38,215,84,1,229,27,203,146,98,240,155,16,79,245,69,14,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
