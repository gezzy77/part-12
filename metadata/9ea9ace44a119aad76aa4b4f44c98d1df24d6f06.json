Long past the years of diapers, homework, and recitals, Roger and GinnyÃ¢â‚¬â€Boppo and Mimi to the kidsÃ¢â‚¬â€quickly reaccustom themselves to the world of small children: bedtime stories, talking toys, playdates, nonstop questions, and nonsequential thought. Though reeling from Amy's death they carry on, reconstructing a family, sustaining one another, and guiding three lively, alert, and tender-hearted children through the pains and confusions of grief. As he marvels at the strength of his son-in-law, a surgeon, and the tenacity and skill of his wife, a former kindergarten teacher, Roger attends each day to &quot;the one household duty I have mastered&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€preparing the morning toast perfectly to each child's liking.\n\nWith the wit, heart, precision, and depth of understanding that has characterized his work, Roger Rosenblatt peels back the layers on this most personal of losses to create both a tribute to his late daughter and a testament to familial love. The day Amy died, Harris told Ginny and Roger, &quot;It's impossible.&quot; Roger's story tells how a family makes the possible of the impossible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea9ace44a119aad76aa4b4f44c98d1df24d6f06","amp;dn":"Making+Toast+by+Roger+Rosenblatt+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea9ace44a119aad76aa4b4f44c98d1df24d6f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,169,172,228,74,17,154,173,118,170,75,79,68,201,141,29,242,77,111,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
