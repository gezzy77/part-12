Sellers wrote the bestselling Detective Jackson mystery/thriller seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€a Readers Favorite award winnerÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as the Agent Dallas series and provocative standalone thrillers. Her novels have been highly praised by crime fiction magazines, and is one of the highest ranked crime fiction authors on Amazon.\n\nThe Sex Club - When a bomb explodes at a birth-control clinic and a young client turns up dead, Detective Jackson is assigned both cases. But are they connected? Kera, the clinic nurse who discovers that the girl's Bible group is really a sexual free-for-all, thinks they are. But confidentiality keeps her from telling the police, so she digs for the truth on her own and becomes the bomber's new target. Soon another girl is murdered. Can Jackson uncover the killer's shocking identity in time to stop the slaughter?\n\nSecrets to Die For - When young social worker Raina Hughes arrives at a ramshackle trailer outside of town, she's on a mission to protect a small boy from abusive parents. But when Detective Wade Jackson arrives at the same location hours later, his mission is far grimmer: investigating Raina's murder. The victim's vicious death is a shocking event for laid-back Eugene, Oregon ? and even more chilling when one of Jackson's fellow officers suspects an elusive rapist whose appetite is turning murderous. Jackson thinks he's got a tight case against the meth-head dad who menaced Raina, but the evidence seems to leave his suspect in the clear ? and a homicidal sex offender still on the loose. What Jackson fears is that his new love affair with nurse Kera Kollmorgan may be knocking him off his game. And what he never expects is to find an ally in savvy reporter Sophie Speranza, who may have stumbled on the killer's shocking motive. But even as Jackson and Sophie team up to tighten the noose, their quarry zeroes in on his next victim ? ready to take his twisted game to the next level.\n\nThrilled to Death - Detective Wade Jackson, of Eugene Oregon's Violent Crimes Division, has more than a professional interest in the disappearance of Danette Blake. In addition to being the mother of an infant, the missing young woman is also the widowed daughter-in-law of Kera Kollmorgan ? the woman Jackson loves. But the politics surrounding the mysterious death of Courtney Durham, a notorious party girl with rich, powerful parents, trumps Jackson's personal concern. While all signs indicate Danette has fled the pressures of single motherhood, it appears Courtney's reputation for walking on the wild side led to her homicide. But without evidence of foul play, Jackson may be probing ?crimes? that never happened. As headquarters turns up the heat, he follows a trail of twists and turns to a secretive psychiatrist, a sleazy strip-club owner, a benevolent organization for needy mothers, and a bizarre service for edgy thrill-seekers. The deeper he descends into Courtney's wanton world, the more suspects, motives, and disturbing facts he uncovers. And though it's hardly the first time a case has led Jackson into dark territory, he winds up face-to-face with the last person he expects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc248c92dfa00f6ee05be904b26b8443e6db707b","amp;dn":"Detective+Jackson+Mystery+Series+-+L.J.+Sellers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc248c92dfa00f6ee05be904b26b8443e6db707b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,36,140,146,223,160,15,110,224,91,233,4,178,107,132,67,230,219,112,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
