Unfortunately, since we only began offering these live shows in 2003, and Jimmy toured with the band in 2000, we have had to say no.\n\nUntil now, that is!  It may have been unexpected, due to a transportation snafu that delayed Warren Haynes' flight, but the Jimmy/Derek lineup was back in full flight for this completely unique, one-of-a-kind show.  Besides Jimmy sitting in for Warren, due to a back injury Gregg only played guitar at this show, with keyboard duties handled by Danny Louis from Gov't Mule.\n\nThe result is a show unlike any other you've heard, with plenty of highlights.  The opening 30 minute &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; was unprecedented, and showed the special chemistry that Derek and Jimmy have together.  &quot;Don't Keep Me Wonderin'&quot; and &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; showed that Gregg was in fine voice, injured back or not.\n\nOne of the most singular moments in this unique show was an expanded 15 minute version of &quot;Anyday&quot; that featured a full-blown &quot;Blue Sky&quot; jam.  Derek is really hittin' the note on this one!  A magical &quot;Elizabeth Reed&quot; and an explosive &quot;One Way Out&quot; encore cap off an extraordinary night, with the ABB rising above adverse circumstances to deliver an excellent show.\n\nDisc One\n\n1.

Gregg Allman's back also felt better at this show, and Gregg played most of the keyboards, only needing occasional help from Danny Louis and Kofi Burbridge on keys.\n\nEnough of the personnel report, let's move on to the show!  The opening combo of &quot;Don't Want You No More&quot; and &quot;Cross To Bear&quot; announced that the ABB was back at full force and taking no prisoners.  &quot;Revival&quot; was nothing less than spectacular, an amazing version worthy of &quot;Best Ever&quot; consideration.  Check out the ringing guitar harmony between Warren and Derek in the middle of the jam--talk about hittin' the note!\n\nThe extended, revamped &quot;Rockin' Horse&quot; continues to change and grow into a jam masterpiece, and this version was incredible, with Derek slaying the new intro section with his wicked slide riffs.  Susan Tedeschi added guitar and vocals to a bluesy &quot;Little By Little,&quot; and a punishing &quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; set the stage perfectly for a tender version of &quot;Melissa.&quot;\n\nKofi Burbridge of Derek's band joined the ABB on B-3 for a smokin' hot &quot;Les Brers in A Minor,&quot; with the whole band jamming as one.  Danny Louis sat in for the rowdy &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; encore, which ended the show on an up note and proved that the ABB were ready for another action-packed tour!\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
