In this short course, you'll create a simple registration system that allows users to log in and out of your applications. By taking advantage of Google's Firebase authentication service, you can manage registrations easily and securely. In the process, you'll explore working with the AngularJS application structure (including routes and controllers), storing user information into the Firebase NoSQL database, and creating services to manage registration information throughout different controllers. This will help you create a great registration template that you can use as a starting point in a variety of web applications.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding a basic MVC structure\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing routes\r\n\tâ€¢\tProcessing form input\r\n\tâ€¢\tIntegrating Firebase\r\n\tâ€¢\tStoring registration information in the database\r\n\tâ€¢\tLogging users in and out of an app\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2bcf0adbbfc84fe1b159e7f0b07647a24a6c0d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+AngularJS%3A+Adding+Registration+to+Your+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2bcf0adbbfc84fe1b159e7f0b07647a24a6c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,43,207,10,219,191,200,79,225,177,89,231,240,176,118,71,162,74,108,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
