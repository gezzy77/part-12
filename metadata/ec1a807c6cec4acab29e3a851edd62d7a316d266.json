Suddenly, a macabre nun is seen lurking about, with an entourage of lewd and gibbering homeless women who seem to KNOW what evil secret lurks in the bowels of the old house. As the couples' dreams turn to lust-stained nightmares, and the bodies of missing persons are found impaled, the basement's secret is revealed at last: the remnants of Dracula himself...\n\nIncubi\nHe promises them his love, then kills without mercy. Each seduction ends in death--each victim, murdered in bed. Detective Jack Cordesman has vowed to unravel the demented mystery, to enter the heart of a maniacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s temptation...where desire demands the ultimate price.\nThe stranger beckons--the man of her dreams...or of her worst nightmares. Veronica Polk longs for love, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love that awaits in the strange, moonlit manse. Something evil broods, leading her blindly into a mire of erotic obsessions and savage desires. An unspeakable secret awaits--ancient, unholy--that thirsts for her spirit and hungers for her fleshÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nOperator B\nScience fiction, Lee-style. This critically acclaimed novella involves a U.S. Air Force test pilot recruited for a very special mission: to fly an operational recovered UFO. Any test pilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream, right? Wrong. Special disfiguring surgery is required for anyone human who wants to fly the craft. This expertly plotted novella proves to detractors that Lee can write in many arenas, not just horror, and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to rely on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“gross-outÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to keep readers enthralled. \n\nRoom 415\nJack Flood has a problem that he's long-since given up trying to solve. He's a success in business but a failure as a man. He doesn't even care anymore...until he sees the open window in the hotel room below. The open window...and the woman... The door looks unassuming -- Room 415 -- but Flood knows what horrors rage behind it. Soon the sweat of his desire will be besmirched with butcher's blood, and the moans of passion will grind down to throat-ripping screams. Flood is about to walk hand in hand with the woman of his dreams, into the wide-open jaws of the lewdest nightmare, where love, longing, and desire collide with the unspeakable -- all in the middle of a night that bids the question: JUST HOW SICK CAN YOU BE? Knock on the door, and turn the knob, and step across the threshold of... ROOM 415\n\nThe Golem\nFrom the bones of the dead, and from a long buried secret...they rise to kill. The original Golem was molded from riverbed clay centuries ago, enchanted by spells to protect the innocent. But now a diabolical design has perverted the ancient, mystical rites to forge new Golems that stalk the night. Into the twilight deeps of the quiet Maryland coast, they come forth, to rape, mangle, and murder, and to bring horror and atrocity to all in their demonic path. Only a young couple can stop them but little do they know, an even worse secret is buried in their own midst...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1a807c6cec4acab29e3a851edd62d7a316d266","amp;dn":"Five+Books+by+Edward+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1a807c6cec4acab29e3a851edd62d7a316d266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,26,128,124,108,236,74,202,178,158,58,133,30,221,98,215,163,22,210,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
