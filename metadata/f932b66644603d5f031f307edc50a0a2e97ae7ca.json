Meanwhile, Stewie finds a turtle at the park and brings him home as his new pet, unaware that the turtle is evil and determined to destroy StewieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in the all-new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lois Comes Out Of Her ShellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ episode of FAMILY GUY airing Sunday, Nov. 25 (9:00-9:30 PM ET/PT) on FOX.\n\nShow Summary: The show follows the adventures of an endearingly ignorant dad, PETER GRIFFIN (Seth MacFarlane), and his hilariously odd family of middle-class New Englanders in Quahog, RI. LOIS (Alex Borstein) is PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, a stay at home mom with no patience for her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s antics.\n\nThen there are their kids: 17-year-old MEG (Mila Kunis) is a social outcast and the Griffin family punching bag; 13-year-old CHRIS (Seth Green) is a socially awkward teen who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a clue about the opposite sex; and 1-year-old STEWIE (MacFarlane) is a diabolically clever baby whose burgeoning sexuality is very much a work in progress. Rounding out the Griffin household is BRIAN (MacFarlane), the family dog, a member of Mensa with a penchant for dry martinis and dumb blondes.\n\nEnjoy, and remember: SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f932b66644603d5f031f307edc50a0a2e97ae7ca","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+S11E07+Lois+Comes+Out+of+Her+Shell+720p+HuluRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f932b66644603d5f031f307edc50a0a2e97ae7ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,50,182,102,68,96,61,95,3,31,48,126,220,80,160,162,233,122,231,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
