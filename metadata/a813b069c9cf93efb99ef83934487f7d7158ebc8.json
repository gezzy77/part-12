They are famous for their experiments, mixing pipes and fiddle with guitar, piano, whistle and cittern (the medieval mandolin), for their adventurous blend of traditional and contemporary songs, and for their ever-changing lineup. The band has included many of the celebrities of Scottish folk, from Karine Polwart and John McCusker, to songwriter Alan Reid, who left last year after contributing the best song yet about the banking crisis, the quietly furious Robber Barons, to their last \nalbum. This new set lacks Reid's anger but continues the experiments, with the multi-instrumental four-piece concentrating on slinky, attacking pieces, featuring the pipe playing of Mike Katz, or duelling fiddles from Alasdair White and newcomer Ewen Henderson. The songs are mostly slower than the tunes, and include an exquisite, whistle-backed Scottish Gaelic ballad Mo Ghleannan Taobh Loch Liobhainn, and an \nunexpected Celtic Soul treatment of the Otis Redding favourite, That's How Strong My Love Is. Like England's Fairport Convention, they are impressive survivors\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a813b069c9cf93efb99ef83934487f7d7158ebc8","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Band...Line+Up%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a813b069c9cf93efb99ef83934487f7d7158ebc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,19,176,105,201,207,147,239,185,158,248,57,52,72,127,125,113,88,235,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
