Wanted to share his wonderful music-making with all of you. This torrent includes all 3 volumes (2 CDs each) of Emil Gilels on the Great Pianists of the 20th Century series on the Philips label. \n\nGilels is regarded by many as one of the most significant pianists of the twentieth century and is universally admired for his superb technical control and burnished tone. This collection here features almost 8 hours of classical music written for the piano, including works by Mozart, Beethoven, bach, Chopin, Brahms, Schumann, Prokofiev and others. Just click on the &quot;Files&quot; to see each set&amp;#039;s tracklist.\n\nI adore the rendition of Weber&amp;#039;s 2nd Sonata here. Such a beautiful, lyrical piece that is often forgotten nowadays. Gilels totally masters it in this live performance. \n\nHope you enjoy and please seed so we can spread this wonderful music all over the world!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9aa90e9de182d828a8feecf6b006e17fd02e50","amp;dn":"Great+Pianists+of+the+20th+Century+-+Emil+Gilels+%5Bcomplete+-+6CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9aa90e9de182d828a8feecf6b006e17fd02e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,154,169,14,157,225,130,216,40,168,254,236,246,176,6,225,127,208,46,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
