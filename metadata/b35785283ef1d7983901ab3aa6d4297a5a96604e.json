Among the standouts are Brendan DuBoisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Ride-Along,&quot; in which a veteran cop and a freelance reporter get involved in a robbery, and Beth Ann Fennelly and Tom FranklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;What His Hands Had Been Waiting For,&quot; in which the struggle for survival in the Mississippi Delta during the terrible 1927 flood takes a strange turn. In Ed GormanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memorable &quot;Flying Solo,&quot; two old men dying of cancer make the most of their last days. As in previous volumes, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to find lighter fare, but S.J. RozanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clever &quot;Chin Yong-Yun Takes a Case&quot; is a beautifully crafted and satisfying tale of amateur detection. Other contributors include such pros as Lawrence Block, Loren D. Estleman, and Mickey Spillane and Max Collins.\n \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35785283ef1d7983901ab3aa6d4297a5a96604e","amp;dn":"Harlan+Coben-The+Best+American+Mystery+Stories+2011-Epub%2C+Mobi%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35785283ef1d7983901ab3aa6d4297a5a96604e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,87,133,40,62,241,215,152,57,1,171,58,166,212,41,122,90,150,96,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
