Anyway, it has the original four Dark Horse story arcs, all together in this relatively low-quality 300+ page .CBR file.\n\nPlease seed and share with our friends on TPB!\n\n------\n\nFrom thething.wikia.com:\n\nThe Thing from Another World is a four-part comic miniseries published by Dark Horse Comics, it served as sequels to the film (The Thing From Another World, The Thing From Another World: Climate of Fear, The Thing From Another World: Eternal Vows, The Thing From Another World: Questionable Research), featuring the character of MacReady as the lone human survivor of Outpost #31 and depicting Childs as infected (The Thing From Another World: Climate of Fear Issue 3 of 4). Questionable Research explores a parallel reality where MacReady is not around to stop the Thing and a suspicious scientist must prevent its spread, after it has wreaked destruction on Outpost 31.
