Their niche may be folk and country melodies, but throughout their upcoming Every Child a Daughter, Every Moon a Sun you can hear subtle nods to other genres hidden underneath the twangy guitars.\n\nThe album is a journey through the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s search for different ways to express their music and the outcome is a solid effort that the Toronto-based band recorded in the same Montreal studio that the Arcade Fire recorded Funeral.\n\nThroughout the 13 songs The Wooden SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s energy is stretched over a wide array of emotions, but their talents are never thin.
