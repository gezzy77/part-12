They are best known for the song &quot;Better Days&quot; as well as their cover of Cameo's &quot;Word Up!&quot;.\n\n Originally called Blind Allez, then for a short time 'Phobia', GUN were formed in 1987 by Giuliano Gizzi (guitar) and Cami Morlotti (bass), with Mark Rankin (vocals), Alan Thornton (drums) and David Aitken (guitar). Signed in 1988 by A&amp;M Records the band line-up changed after Thornton, Morlotti and Aitken parted company with them and new recruits Dante Gizzi, Scott Shields and Baby Stafford joined. In the studio, Jim McDermott (Kevin McDermott Orchestra, Simple Minds and The Silencers), provided drums on the albums Taking On the World and Gallus. Debut album Taking On the World was also released this year. Rankin's cousin Sharleen Spiteri, of fellow Scottish band Texas and ex drummer Thornton contributed backing vocals to several songs on the album. The single &quot;Better Days&quot; from the album made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Gun toured the US and supported The Rolling Stones on their European Urban Jungle Tour of 1990. Tours with Bon Jovi and Def Leppard followed shortly after.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand:\n\nGiuliano 'Jools' Gizzi\n\nDante Gizzi\n\nPaul McManus\n\nJohnny McGlynn\n\nAndy Carr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eec9b57438a1fa098cdaba0d96630e56b4ad44b","amp;dn":"Gun+-+Frantic+%5B2015%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eec9b57438a1fa098cdaba0d96630e56b4ad44b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,236,155,87,67,138,31,160,152,205,171,160,217,102,48,229,107,74,212,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
