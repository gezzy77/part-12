In 2008, lead singer Kirstin Gundred (aka Dee Dee) began making solo recordings as Dum Dum Girls, deriving the name both from the VaselinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album Dum-Dum and from the Iggy Pop song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dum Dum Boys.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Over the course of the next year, Dee Dee released a couple singles (a 7&quot; single on Hozac, a four-way split single on Art Fag), a 12&quot; EP (Yours Alone, released via Captured Tracks), and a compilation disc appearance (on Art FagÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blissed Out cassette comp). Thanks to the high level of buzz surrounding Dee Dee (and, of course, the quality of the records), Sub Pop signed Dum Dum Girls in 2009. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tArt Fag Recordings\nCatalog:\t\tAF006 \n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n01.Ship Of Love\n02.Hey Sis\n03.Throw Aggi\n04.Catholicked\n05.Let It Be Me\n06.Mercury Mary\n07.Brite Futures\n08.Put A Sock In It\n09.M.Y.O.B.\n10.Longhair\n11.Dream Away Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ab44d8375b036c50088f015df733cb1c86331c4","amp;dn":"Dum+Dum+Girls+-+Blissed+Out+%5B16-48+Cassette%5D+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ab44d8375b036c50088f015df733cb1c86331c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,180,77,131,117,176,54,197,0,136,240,21,223,115,60,177,200,99,49,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
