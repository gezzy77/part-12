Swordfishtrombones marks the beginning of an obvious trilogy that saw the emergence of Waits as a designer of soundscapes (this was the first of his albums Waits produced himself), with an overall tone that blends equal parts German cabaret, the patina of old 78s, and the sentimental power of a John McCormack ballad. Waits began using his voice in extraordinary ways here, from the sideshow bark of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUndergroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the cough-syrup strain of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSwordfishtrombone,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the instrumentation changed with him, with a new clang of Harry Partch-inspired percussion and Salvation Army brass arrangements. In hindsight, there were hints of this sound on Heartattack and Vine, but nothing prepared fans for this full-blown masterpiece. \n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTom Waits - Vocal, Chair, Hammond B-3 Organ, Piano, Harmonium, Synthesizer, Freedom Bell \nVictor Feldman - Bass Marimba, Marimba, Shaker, Bass Drum with Rice, Bass Boo Bams, Brake Drum, Bell Plate, Snare, Hammond B-3 Organ, Snare Drum, Bells, Conga, Bass Drum, Dabuki Drum, Tambourine, African Talking Drum \nLarry Taylor - Acoustic Bass, Electric Bass \nRandy Aldcroft - Baritone Horn, Trombone \nStephen Taylor Arvizu Hodges - Drums, Parade Drum, Cymbals, Parade Bass Drum , Glass Harmonica\nFred Tackett - Electric Guitar, Banjo Guitar \nFrancis Thumm - Metal Aunglongs, Glass Harmonica \nGreg Cohen - Bass, Acoustic Bass \nJoe Romano - Trombone, Trumpet \nAnthony Clark Stewart - Bagpipes \nClark Spangler - Synthesizer Program \nBill Reichenbach - Trombone \nDick (Slyde) Hyde - Trombone \nRonnie Barron - Hammond Organ \nEric Bikales - Organ \nCarlos Guitarlos - Electric Guitar \nRichard Gibbs - Glass Harmonica \n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.  &quot;Underground&quot;   1:58 \n2.  &quot;Shore Leave&quot;   4:12 \n3.  &quot;Dave the Butcher&quot; (Instrumental) 2:15 \n4.  &quot;Johnsburg, Illinois&quot;   1:30 \n5.  &quot;16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six&quot;   4:30 \n6.  &quot;Town with No Cheer&quot;   4:22 \n7.  &quot;In the Neighborhood&quot;   3:04 \n8.  &quot;Just Another Sucker on the Vine&quot; (Instrumental) 1:42 \n9.  &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot;   1:50 \n10. &quot;Swordfishtrombone&quot;   3:00 \n11. &quot;Down, Down, Down&quot;   2:10 \n12. &quot;Soldier's Things&quot;   3:15 \n13. &quot;Gin Soaked Boy&quot;   2:20 \n14. &quot;Trouble's Braids&quot;   1:18 \n15. &quot;Rainbirds&quot; (Instrumental) 3:05 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d8ccfb591a8af3508d9574e02fcd4d589fb74e","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Swordfishtrombones++%5B1983%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d8ccfb591a8af3508d9574e02fcd4d589fb74e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,216,204,251,89,26,138,243,80,141,149,116,224,47,205,77,88,159,183,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
