Yet many women find detox plans difficult to follow and are disappointed with the results. In her ten years of working privately with celebrity clients at leading Manhattan spas, Natalia Rose has discovered that traditional detox plans don't work for adult women because their microbial balance is completely out of whack. In fact, doing the wrong kind of detox can make their symptoms even worse!\n\nHere is the solution. Rose has formulated a very specific detox prescription for women that is easy to follow and gentle on the system, yet yields fantastic results that are both immediate and lasting. In Detox for Women, she brings you her powerful step-by-step plan that will help you shed weight, look years younger, and radiate energy in only 28 days.\n\nLike Rose's celebrity clients, you will love this plan! Rose steers readers away from traditional detox fare like fruit and nuts and cautions against eating too much raw food too soon. And while many detox programs do not allow you to eat at all, during the next 28 days you will enjoy\n\n* Cooked foods that are easy to digest\n* Treats like dark chocolate and wine\n* Recipes that hark back to favorite foods like pumpkin pie and guacamole\n* Sunshine for Breakfast! Rose's own elixir for health and beauty\n* Great restaurantsÃ¢â‚¬â€this plan can even be tailored for eating out!\n\nYou will also luxuriate in relaxing baths, get plenty of fresh air, and enjoy meals that are simple to prepare, beautiful to look at, and delicious to eat. Like Rose's clients, you will probably also find that this way of living is so easy and rewarding that you will even want to make permanent changes after the 28 days are over.\n\nWith inspiring stories from real women, Natalia Rose doesn't just give you a detox prescription but also real hope for the kind of transformation you have always wanted.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/8634/f58ea188.png[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2de01286ea934c8eda8634d4177ec0ce155a13","amp;dn":"Detox+for+Women%3A+An+All+New+Approach+for+a+Sleek+Body+and+Radian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2de01286ea934c8eda8634d4177ec0ce155a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,45,224,18,134,234,147,76,142,218,134,52,212,23,126,192,206,21,90,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
