Despite worrying signs early on that their third album was going to be riddled with clichÃƒÂ©s (&quot;We are the Voice of the Youth&quot; *shudder*), the frustrated, pent-up fury of frontman Robert Ljung's lyrics on &quot;Means To An End (The Greatest Betrayer)&quot; sees the Swedes put some distance between themselves and the rest of the hit nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ miss post-hardcore scene.\n\nSeething with aggression, Silence The World is an album littered with quality moments and will certainly find a welcome home in those of you out there who like your metalcore to hit you like train. On the other hand, if you're a fan of the more recent Bring Me The Horizon material, you'll certainly appreciate tracks like &quot;Aftermath&quot;, which may be built around a spine of bruising metalcore, but are given some depth with layers of atmospherics.\n\nOn the downside the inclusion of those '80s &quot;woah-ooah-ooahs&quot; here and there along with the occasional clichÃƒÂ© or two in the lyrical department result in the loss of a mark or two, but they do guarantee that the likes of &quot;Friends That Used To Be&quot; will be rattling round your head for weeks. Thankfully, while some bands go overkill with the melody stuff there is no such problem with Adept with the brutal Emmure style beatdowns of &quot;The Toughest Kids&quot; quickly ensuring the band and the album are soon back on the right track.\n\nQuality stuff, Silence The World benefits from a top notch production job from Fredrik Nordstrom (and we all know the beast that was created when he got his hands on the There Is a Hell... album). However, NordstromÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic touch or not, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to argue against a band who smash you in the face with anthemic behemoths like &quot;The Toughest Kids&quot;, songs that show a group who are now starting to show how potent they can be.\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 93 MiB\nDuration                                 : 39mn 55s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Silence the World\nAlbum/Performer                          : Adept\nPart/Total                               : 1\nTrack name/Total                         : 11\nPerformer                                : Adept\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nGenre                                    : Post-Hardcore\nRecorded date                            : 2013\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98r\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nDuration                                 : 39mn 55s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n1.
