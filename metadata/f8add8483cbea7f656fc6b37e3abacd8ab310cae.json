TriOptimum Corporation: we give you the stars!\r\nThe second--and best!--game in the series stands all on its own as a masterpiece of gaming history. The starship Von Braun took a giant leap for mankind as it made its first interstellar journey. The mission was going as planned until a lone distress call from the Tau Ceti V sector was picked up. An away team was sent on a rescue mission, but once it arrived at its destination, there was no sign of any humans and the source of the signal remained unclear. They didn't realize something crucial, though: they brought something back with them when they returned. Now, you--a member of the ship's security team--awake from cryostasis to the sounds of screams of pain and horror as everything falls apart. The state-of-the-art spaceship becomes a deathtrap, and the only hope you have is the contemptuous whisper of a voice guiding you through the dark corridors, leading you towards the ominous secrets that lurk in the shadows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8add8483cbea7f656fc6b37e3abacd8ab310cae","amp;dn":"System+Shock+2+%28v2.3.0.11%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8add8483cbea7f656fc6b37e3abacd8ab310cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,173,216,72,60,190,167,246,86,252,107,55,227,171,172,216,171,49,12,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
