As our relationship with technology becomes ever closer and more complex, so too grows the likelihood of it being exploited. Terrible news, perhaps, for the luddite wondering how his new microwave has just given away his credit card details. But for the developer of a game about a white-hat hacker using their skills to defame the establishment and return power to the people, itâ€™s a dream come true. Watch Dogs 2 is bigger, prettier and boasts a suite of new features and improvements. More importantly, it reflects the connected worldâ€™s relentless, exponential expansion. Simply, Watch Dogs 2â€™s hacking is, like its subject matter, broader, deeper, and more persistent. \r\n\r\nInside issue 295: we talk to the creators of Watch Dogs 2 about Ubisoft's most ambitious open world to date; the story behind the Dark Souls board game Kickstarter smash; and reviews of games including Doom, Overwatch and Dangerous Golf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71afb848d85cb340547300cde6d9cdc26c82403a","amp;dn":"Edge+August+2016+Issue+295+pdf+Gamers+Magazine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71afb848d85cb340547300cde6d9cdc26c82403a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,175,184,72,216,92,179,64,84,115,0,205,230,217,205,194,108,130,64,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
