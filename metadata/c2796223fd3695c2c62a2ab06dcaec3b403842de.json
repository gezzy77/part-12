The band played a style of new wave music similar to New York electronica duo Suicide and Swiss techno-rock duo Yello, by layering vocals, yelps, guitar riffs, electronic sound effects and short samples over pulsating synthesizer bass lines. Their use of video montage, as well as their music, is similar to that of the American New Wave act Devo. The band achieved moderate fame in the mid- to late 1980s, when the song &quot;Love Missile F1-11&quot; hit the pop charts around the world, helped by its use in the cult-hit movie Ferris Bueller&amp;#039;s Day Off.\n\nThe themes and imagery in the band&amp;#039;s songs were often influenced by futuristic, dystopian or post-apocalyptic films such as A Clockwork Orange, The Terminator, Blade Runner and the Mad Max trilogy. The band&amp;#039;s music and image also mashed together a range of other pop culture influences, including the electronica/Krautrock influences of Kraftwerk, Marc Bolan&amp;#039;s T-Rex, and the swagger and sex appeal of Eddie Cochran, Elvis Presley and glam rock.\nTRACKLISTING:\n\n (01)Video Trailer Mix.mp3\n (02)Love Missile F1-11.mp3\n (03)Hack Attack.mp3\n (04)21st Century Boy.mp3\n (05)Buy EMI.mp3\n (06)Rockit Miss USA (Death Wish IV Mix).mp3\n (07)Teenage Thunder (Sputstyle).mp3\n (08)Suicide (Live in London Sept&amp;#039; 86).mp3\n (09)Massive Retaliation (The Massive Edit).mp3\n (10)Sex Bomb Boogie (Magic Flute).mp3\n (11)Success.mp3\n (12)Frankenstein Cha Cha Cha.mp3\n (13)Dancerama (7 Mix).mp3\n (14)Barbarandroid.mp3\n (15)Albinoni Vs Star Wars (Part 1).mp3\n (16)Albinoni Vs Star Wars (Part 1 &amp;&amp; 2).mp3\n(17)Rio Rocks (7).mp3\n(18)Aliens.mp3\n (19)Love Missile F1-11 (Westbam Remix Short Version).mp3\n (20)Sputnik advert.mp3 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/aff08110337048&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/aff08110337048&lt;/a&gt;\nVIDEOS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST AT SHAREGO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2796223fd3695c2c62a2ab06dcaec3b403842de","amp;dn":"-SHAREGO+PRESENTS+Sigue+Sigue+Sputnik+-+21+Century+Boys%28The+Best","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2796223fd3695c2c62a2ab06dcaec3b403842de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,121,98,35,253,54,149,194,198,42,42,176,109,202,236,59,64,56,66,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
