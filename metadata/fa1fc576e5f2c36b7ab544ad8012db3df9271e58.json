But all is not as it seems, and this landmark event propels Ed Brubaker's epic to its greatest heights. Brubaker uses this device to examine Steve Rogers' impact to his friends and closest confidants and also build up the character of Bucky Barnes, recently reformed from his days as The Winter Soldier, and turn him into a credible and serious contender for the shield and costume. Steve Epting's detailed art is astonishing and the best of his career. Even read as a stand-along, this is a can't miss TPB. \n\nThis is the digital HD copy by Tyrant Lizard King-Empire, and there is also a copy by Ubersoldier-DCP available but I went with this one instead. Thanks to them for their efforts, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1fc576e5f2c36b7ab544ad8012db3df9271e58","amp;dn":"Captain+America+-+Death+Of+A+Dream+%282008%7CDigital%7CTLK-EMP-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1fc576e5f2c36b7ab544ad8012db3df9271e58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,31,197,118,229,242,195,107,122,181,68,173,128,18,219,61,249,39,30,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
