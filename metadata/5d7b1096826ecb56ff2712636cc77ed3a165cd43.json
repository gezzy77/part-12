Perfect for war (an efficient killer) but socially unhuman, the main interest of the play is the hero himself, an almost superhuman presence charged with pride, contempt and martial virtue to the point of self-destruction and psychic disintegration.\n\nThe political context is the disappearance of the heroic ethic as the State becomes increasingly enmeshed in class conflict, a money economy and political extremism. Both the Roman Republic and 17C Stuart England were headed for political failure, civil war and social upheaval.\n\nLeft and Right have claimed the play. (Shakespeare notoriously being a black hole of interpretation) And very curiously the French Republic banned it in the 1930s as a 'fascist' work.
