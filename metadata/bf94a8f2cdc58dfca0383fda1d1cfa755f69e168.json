Tonight\n\nScreamFree Parenting is not just about lowering your voice. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about learning to calm your emotional reactions and learning to focus on your own behavior more than your kidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavior . . . for their benefit. Our biggest enemy as parents is not the TV, the Internet, or even drugs. Our biggest enemy is our own emotional reactivity. When we say we ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlost itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with our kids, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in that sentence is our own adulthood. And then we wonder why our kids have so little respect for us, why our kids seem to have all the power in the family.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to do it differently. And you can. You can start to create and enjoy the types of calm, mutually respectful, and loving relationships with your kids that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always craved. You can begin to revolutionize your family, starting tonight.\n\nParenting is not about kids, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about parents.\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not in control, then you cannot be in charge.\nWhat every kid really needs are parents who are able to keep their cool no matter what.\n\nEasier said than done? Not anymore, thanks to ScreamFree Parenting, the principle-based approach thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inspiring parents everywhere to truly revolutionize their family dynamics. Moving beyond the child-centered, technique-based approaches that ultimately fail, the ScreamFree way compels you to:\n\nfocus on yourself\ncalm yourself down, and\ngrow yourself up\n\nBy staying calm and connected with your kids, you begin to operate less out of your deepest fears and more out of your highest principles, revolutionizing your relationships in the process.\n\nScreamFree Parenting is not just another parenting book. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the first parenting\nbook that maintainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from beginning to endÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that parenting is NOT about kids . . . itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about parents. As parents pay more attention to controlling their own behavior instead of their kidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavior, the result is stronger, more rewarding, and more fulfilling family relationships.\n\nFor those of you reading who are parents, know parents, or have had parents, the notion that the greatest thing you can do for your children is to learn to focus on yourself may sound strange, even heretical. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why: we are the only ones we can control. We cannot control our kidsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½we cannot control the behavior of any other human being. And yet, so many ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexpertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ keep giving us more tools (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtechniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to help us try to do just that. And, of course, the more we try to control, the more out of control our children become.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make me come up there.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make me pull this car over.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow many times do I have to tell you?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Even our language suggests that our kids have control over us.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no wonder that we end up screaming. Or shutting down. Or simply giving up. And the charts, refrigerator magnets, family meetings, and other techniques in most typical parenting books just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work. They end up making us feel more frustrated and more powerless in this whole parenting thing.\n96kbs\n-----------\nThis practical, effective guide for parents of all ages with kids of all ages introduces proven principles for overcoming the anxieties and stresses of parenting and setting new patterns of connection and cooperation.
