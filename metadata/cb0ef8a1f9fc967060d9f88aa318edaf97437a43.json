Which is a grandiose way of saying that, no matter how partisans may complain, there are many listeners out there that don't want to delve into the deliriously rich catalog of Prince and would rather spend time with a single disc of all the hits -- especially since the first singles compilation was botched, spread too thin over two discs and sequenced as if it were on shuffle play. That doesn't mean that 2001's The Very Best of Prince is perfect, even if it is a better hits overview than its predecessor. First of all, Prince had so many hits, and so many of them were so good, that 17 tracks couldn't possibly summarize everything great. After all, this doesn't have Top Ten hits like &quot;Delirious,&quot; &quot;Pop Life,&quot; &quot;I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man,&quot; or &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; (or the number one &quot;Batdance,&quot; for that matter, continuing Batman being unofficially written out of his discography), nor does it have such great second-tier hits as &quot;Take Me With U&quot; and &quot;Mountains,&quot; or B-sides like &quot;Irresistible Bitch&quot; and &quot;Erotic City,&quot; let alone album tracks. What is here are the big songs -- &quot;1999,&quot; &quot;Little Red Corvette,&quot; &quot;When Doves Cry,&quot; &quot;Kiss,&quot; and so on -- all presented in their single edits. And, frankly, that's enough to make this a dynamite collection, perfect for those that just want one Prince disc, and a good, solid listen of some of his best. Besides, this trumps both Hits discs by including &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night,&quot; his best single never to reach the Top 10 - Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine  \n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] I Wanna Be Your Lover\n[02] 1999\n[03] Little Red Corvette\n[04] When Doves Cry\n[05] Let's Go Crazy\n[06] Purple Rain\n[07] I Would Die 4 U\n[08] Raspberry Beret\n[09] Kiss\n[10] Sign O' The Times\n[11] U Got The Look\n[12] Alphabet St.\n[13] Thieves In The Temple\n[14] Gett Off\n[15] Cream\n[16] Diamonds And Pearls\n[17] Money Don't Matter 2 Night\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 01h:13m:12s\nTotal File Size....................... 474mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
