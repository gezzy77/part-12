The album was released on the Dunhill record label on June 11, 1969 and was the first of two albums released by the band that year (see 1969 in music).\n\nThe album contains the top 20 hit singles &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;, &quot;Eli's Coming&quot;, and &quot;Celebrate&quot;; the latter of which (along with the album's opening track &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot;) featured the Chicago horn section. It is also notable for being the first album by Three Dog Night to include songs written by band members, and for its inclusion of the Elton John song &quot;Lady Samantha,&quot; as John would not become widely known in the United States for another year\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:030147b409143d585ff81fdadf903b63963ae588","amp;dn":"Three+Dog+Night+-+Suitable+For+Framing+%282013%29+Japan+SHM-CD+FLAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"030147b409143d585ff81fdadf903b63963ae588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,1,71,180,9,20,61,88,95,248,31,218,223,144,59,99,150,58,229,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
