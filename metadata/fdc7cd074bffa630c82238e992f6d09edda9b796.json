I. Epstein, University of Connecticut This new edition (3rd ed., CH, Apr'95) of this handbook is divided into seven sections covering the fields of civil, architectural, mechanical, electrical, chemical and process plant, water and wastewater, and environmental engineering. Within each section there are several major topics, further divided into numerous subtopics... Choice 20050201 A previous edition of this work is cited in Books for College Libraries, 3e This resource for practicing engineers presents more than 5000 calculation procedures for solving common engineering problems. The volume is divided into sections corresponding to seven engineering disciplines: civil, architectural, mechanical, electrical, sanitary, environmental, and chemical. Utilizing a &quot;cookbook&quot; format, the handbook describes the problem to be solved; provides numbered calculation procedures to be followed; works out an example problem; and (in most instances) presents related calculations.
