Often stylistically compared to The Human League, the group released only a single self-titled album in 1986. \n\nAlthough they had minor hit in the U.K. with the song &quot;No More 'I Love You's'&quot; (later covered by Annie Lennox), a second album, The Big Lie, was recorded but never released. The duo broke up in 1988.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62605941c7d3744734c6d18a6311e55ef5a476c5","amp;dn":"The+Lover+Speaks+-+The+Big+Lie+%5B1987%5D+%5BUnreleased%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62605941c7d3744734c6d18a6311e55ef5a476c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,96,89,65,199,211,116,71,52,198,209,138,99,17,229,94,245,164,118,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
