These skills are essential to effective\nwritten communication because they make the readerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s job easier. Students who do\nnot master these skills will never write a winning essay, a reader-friendly letter, or a strong business memo. It will not matter that the writers have brilliant ideas or outstanding stories to share: Their ideas will never be conveyed effectively. On the other hand, students who do master punctuation, capitalization, and spelling will\nhave some of the tools they need to execute clear and effective writing in any arena.\nIn the second and third grades, your students have probably already begun to\nsense how much fun writing can be. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s important to keep that excitement alive\nby including a variety of enjoyable writing projects in your curriculum. Invite\nstudents to write adventure stories, lists, recipes, jokes, reports, book reviews,\nand more. In some cases, you may decide that students need not punctuate and\nspell correctly on a first draft of a story or in a journal entry that only they will\nread. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perfectly appropriate. However, it is very important to emphasize\nthat proper punctuation, capitalization, and spelling must be used when\npublishing or sharing oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing. Whether the final draft will be printed in\nthe school newspaper, displayed on the bulletin board, or handed in to you, it\nshould be polished and grammatically correct.\nIn this book youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find dozens of activities to help you teach punctuation,\ncapitalization, and spelling. The activities are interactive and age-appropriateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nnot the endless drill sheets you may remember from your own school days.\nFrom The Comma-Cupboard Game to the Homophone-Hunt Crossword\nPuzzle, the lessons are sure to please both you and your students.\nYou can use the activities and mini-lessons in any order you like. Check the\nlabel at the top of each lesson to see which major concepts are being explored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12aaaf15a07169ebb984f17dcedd43d1bf4d637a","amp;dn":"Capitalization%2C+Punctuation+and+Spelling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12aaaf15a07169ebb984f17dcedd43d1bf4d637a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,170,175,21,160,113,105,235,185,132,241,125,206,221,67,209,191,77,99,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
