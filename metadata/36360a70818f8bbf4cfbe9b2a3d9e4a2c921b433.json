Their job was to try to block the Vietcong&amp;#039;s supply route.\n\n\nKnown as the &quot;Ho Chi Minh trail&quot;, it ran through Laos, along the border with Vietnam. More than 40,000 Hmong were killed in the fighting that followed.\n\nWhen the US fled Saigon in 1975, Communists also seized control of Laos.\n\nThe Hmong, abandoned by the US, allegedly became the target of retaliation and persecution.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the mass exodus of Hmong refugees into Thailand, which eventually swelled to more than 300,000.\n\nHmong fighters in the jungles of Laos\nSome of them were eventually resettled in the US, but many continue to languish in Thai detention camps. And at least 7,000 Hmong are still hiding in the mountains and jungles of Laos, including some former CIA fighters.\n\nUnder constant threat of attack by the army ? they are a lost tribe ? forgotten by the world for more than three decades.\n\nOur correspondent Tony Birtley trekked for two days from the town of Phon Savan to reach their jungle hideout ? the first television journalist ever to do so.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/52F9367F-54F9-42E3-BCBF-90CDB449969A.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/52F9367F-54F9-42E3-BCBF-90CDB449969A.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCap~ shunster x-YouTube-\n\n\nSoS = http://www.sonofshun.com/forums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36360a70818f8bbf4cfbe9b2a3d9e4a2c921b433","amp;dn":"The+CIA%3Fs+Lost+Tribe%7E+The++Hmong++of+Laos+2008+03+10+%28Al-Jazeera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36360a70818f8bbf4cfbe9b2a3d9e4a2c921b433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,54,10,112,129,143,139,191,76,251,233,178,163,217,228,162,201,33,180,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
