This lighthearted moment aside, Suzy, adapted from a novel by Herbert Gorman is a standard-issue love triangle, set against the tapestry of World War I. Harlow plays a London showgirl, married to Irish engineer Franchot Tone. When foreign spy Benita Hume shoots Tone, mistaking him as a threat against her mission, the terrified Harlow flees into the night, certain that she will be accused of her husband's murder. After the war breaks out, Harlow, believing herself a widow, falls in love with handsome aviator Cary Grant. She marries the well-bred but irresponsible young ace, only to discover that Tone has not been killed after all! This being an idealized World War I film, somebody is going to end up sacrificing his/her life on behalf of somebody else, but we're not about to reveal any more. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028330/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028330/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:29:25\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x528 4/3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1041 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,11 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fe69e7793528c695aadd87ab2bff83ab842c734","amp;dn":"Suzy+%281936%29++Jean+Harlow%2C+Cary+Grant+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fe69e7793528c695aadd87ab2bff83ab842c734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,230,158,119,147,82,140,105,90,173,216,122,178,191,248,58,184,66,199,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
