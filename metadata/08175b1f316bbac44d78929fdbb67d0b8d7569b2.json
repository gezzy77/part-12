This Pakistani singer, who sadly passed away a few years back, had the power to touch the soul with his singing. Though I can't understand a word he said, Night Music's feelings are well received. I like to think of Nusrat's music as mesmerizing and hypnotic as well as emotionally raw. Michael Brook just enhances Nusrat's ideas, making this recording a haunting, painfully sweet listen. This is a must have for any rock collector. Thank you to Peter Gabriel for creating his RealWorld label in which we get to hear such fine musicians from other countries of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08175b1f316bbac44d78929fdbb67d0b8d7569b2","amp;dn":"Night+Song+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1995+New+Age+Ambient+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08175b1f316bbac44d78929fdbb67d0b8d7569b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,23,91,31,49,107,186,196,77,120,146,159,219,182,125,11,141,117,105,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
