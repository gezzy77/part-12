But working from notes and partials left by Jordan, established fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson stepped in to complete the masterwork. With The Gathering Storm (Book 12) and Towers of Midnight (Book 13) behind him, both of which were # 1 New York Times hardcover bestsellers, Sanderson now re-creates the vision that Robert Jordan left behind.\n\nEdited by JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, who edited all of JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books, A Memory of Light will delight, enthrall, and deeply satisfy all of JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legions of readers.\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass.\nWhat was, what will be, and what is,\nmay yet fall under the Shadow.\nLet the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94482ef21fecdd1b6f8593aaadf955636f34fd2","amp;dn":"A+Memory+of+Light+-+Robert+Jordan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94482ef21fecdd1b6f8593aaadf955636f34fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,68,130,239,33,254,205,209,182,248,89,58,170,223,149,86,54,243,79,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
