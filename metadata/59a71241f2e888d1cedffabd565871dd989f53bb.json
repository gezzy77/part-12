Formed in Topeka in 1970, the founding members of the group -- guitarist Kerry Livgren, bassist Dave Hope, and drummer Phil Ehart -- first played together while in high school; with the 1971 addition of classically trained violinist Robbie Steinhardt, they changed their name to White Clover, reverting back to the Kansas moniker for good upon the 1972 arrivals of vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh and guitarist Richard Williams. The group spent the early part of the decade touring relentlessly and struggling for recognition; initially, their mix of boogie and prog rock baffled club patrons, but in due time they established a strong enough following to win a record deal with the Kirshner label.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic/Legacy\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Can I Tell You\n02.Journey From Mariabronn\n03.Song For America\n04.Lamplight Symphony\n05.Icarus (Borne On Wings Of Steel)\n06.The Pinnacle\n07.Child Of Innocence\n08.Carry On Wayward Son\n09.Cheyenne Anthem\n10.Miracles Out Of Nowhere\n11.What's On My Mind\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Point Of Know Return\n02.Portrait (He Knew)\n03.Dust In The Wind\n04.Lightning's Hand\n05.Sparks Of The Tempest\n06.Paradox (Live)\n07.People Of The South Wind\n08.Hold On\n09.Get To Rock On\n10.Play The Game Tonight\n11.Fight Fire With Fire\n12.All I Wanted\n13.Rainmaker\n14.Desperate Times\n15.Eleanor Rigby\n16.Icarus II\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a71241f2e888d1cedffabd565871dd989f53bb","amp;dn":"Kansas+-+Sail+On+30th+Anniversary+Collection+%282004%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a71241f2e888d1cedffabd565871dd989f53bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,167,18,65,242,232,136,209,206,223,250,189,86,88,113,221,152,159,83,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
