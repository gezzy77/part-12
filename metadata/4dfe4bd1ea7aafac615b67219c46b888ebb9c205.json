Between 1455 and 1487, the royal coffers were bankrupted and the conflict resulted in the downfall of the House of Lancaster and the House of York, and the emergence of the illustrious Tudor dynasty.\nAlison WeirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lucid and gripping account focuses on the human side of history, on the people and personalities involved in the conflict. At the centre of the book stands Henry VI, the pious king whose mental instability led to political chaos; Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York and HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rival; and most important of all, Margaret of Anjou, HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife who took up arms in her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cause and battled for many years in a violent manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dfe4bd1ea7aafac615b67219c46b888ebb9c205","amp;dn":"Lancaster+And+York+The+Wars+of+the+Roses+by+Alison+Weir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dfe4bd1ea7aafac615b67219c46b888ebb9c205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,254,75,209,234,122,175,172,97,91,103,33,156,70,184,136,235,185,194,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
