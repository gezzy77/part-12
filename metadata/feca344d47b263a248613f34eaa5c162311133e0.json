Comics Versus Art examines the relationship between comics and the most important institutions of the art world including museums, auction houses, and the art press. Bart Beaty s analysis centres around two questions: why were comics excluded from the history of art for most of the twentieth century, and what does it mean that comics production is now more closely aligned with the art world?
