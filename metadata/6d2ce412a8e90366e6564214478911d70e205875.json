He endowed them with unprecedented and unparalleled powerÃ¢â‚¬â€power to change lives, save souls, and share GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very life. The sacraments are the ordinary means by which God directs the course of each human life and all of world history. The Church celebrates seven sacraments: baptism, Eucharist, confirmation, matrimony, holy orders, confession, and anointing of the sick. Each was established by Jesus for the sake of salvation. When Jesus spoke of the sacraments, He made clear that they were essential: Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God (Jn 3:5) . . . unless you eat of the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you have no life in you (Jn 6: 53).\n\nIn Swear to God, Dr. Scott Hahn explores the richness of ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacramentsÃ¢â‚¬â€their doctrine, history, symbols, and rituals. Drawing upon the Bible and the ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tradition, he shows how GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s covenantsÃ¢â‚¬â€with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and DavidÃ¢â‚¬â€became the driving forces in history. When Jesus came to fulfill all these covenants, He established a new covenant, with greater power than ever before. Christians are GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children now. Joined to Christ by baptism, we can already share in the eternal life of the Trinity, a life we hope to know fully in heaven. But heaven is with us, even now, in the sacraments.\n\nBest-selling author Scott Hahn is a greatly admired Catholic theologian and lecturer as well as the director of the Institute for Applied Biblical Studies. His modern classic, Lamb's Supper, has sold more than 100,000 copies. Written in an accessible style, Swear to God is a testament to the seven sacraments, which Hahn sees not as boring rituals, but as powerful reminders of our covenants with God.\n\n----\n\nHahn, a convert to Catholicism who is professor of biblical theology at Franciscan University in Steubenville, Ohio, continues his popular expositions on various aspects of the Catholic faith in this treatise on the church's seven sacraments. Written in the easy style that has opened the depths of Catholic theology to scores of laypeople, Hahn shares how he once regarded sacraments as &quot;boring,&quot; but reconsidered that view after a challenge from his wife, Kimberly, while both were still Protestants. In reading the works of the church fathers, Hahn came to see the sacraments as signs of God's covenant with humanity and thus more than mere rituals. When Catholics receive them, he writes, they make a covenant with God that has weighty implications. He explains how in ancient times, parties to covenants would swear a sacred oath, offer a sacrifice and share a meal, all elements contained in the sacraments today. Hahn insists sacraments are based in scripture and makes a convincing case that they were not late additions to Christianity, but were practiced by the early church. He offers personal testimony as well, crediting grace from the sacrament of matrimony with sustaining him and his wife through the difficult period in which he left the Protestant ministry and converted to Catholicism. Catholics in search of a fresh look at their faith will find Hahn's enthusiasm inviting. His frequent references to the Catechism also should make this a helpful resource.\n\n----\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book, easy to read but profound in its implications, draws on the Bible, on Catholic teaching, patristic wisdom, and rabbinical learning to explain the meaning and importance of sacraments. What the author tells of his own discovery and experience of sacramental life is illuminating and heartwarming. It will help Catholics grasp better the wonder and necessity of sacraments in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan of salvation and allow other Christians to see their significance for the following of Christ.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Francis Cardinal George, OMI, Archbishop of Chicago\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As one who has lived with a lifelong realistic understanding of the sacraments, especially of the Holy Eucharist, I found Scott HahnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey from CalvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devout but symbolic understanding to the traditional realism of the Church Fathers most enlightening. This book will be a big help to Catholics confronted by careless and inaccurate teaching about the sacraments. It will also aid Protestants, who have often lost even the sacramental piety of the Reformation and who are beginning to rediscover the sacraments instituted by Christ.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Father Benedict J. Groeschel, C.F.R., author of In the Presence of Our Lord\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dr. Hahn has done it once again: he has given us a crisp, clear and compelling look at the very essence of Catholic life, the sacraments. Simply put, Scott believes the sacraments really do work. And he believes that the sacraments are GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wok for us, not our work for God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Most Reverend Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of Milwaukee \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In Swear to God, Dr. Scott Hahn provides his readers with a fresh, enthusiastic introduction to the theology of Sacraments. His readers will be rewarded not only with clear theological information but also with authentically Catholic inspiration. His pen continues to be a blessing for all who seek a deeper understanding of what the Lord has revealed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Edward Cardinal Egan, Archbishop of New York\n\n\n\nMore from Dr. Scott Hahn:\n\n--The Lamb's Supper (Unabridged Audiobook + book)\n   &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10645369&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10645369&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--A Father Who Keeps His Promises (Unabridged Audiobook + book)\n   &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10548781&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10548781&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n--Hail, Holy Queen (13-part audio series + book)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10217917&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10217917&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n--Answering Common Objections (6 CD SET)\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10211970&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10211970&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPlease seed!\n\nMore: https://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic/\n\nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d2ce412a8e90366e6564214478911d70e205875","amp;dn":"Scott+Hahn+-+Swear+to+God+%28Unabridged+Audiobook+%2B+epub%2Fmobi%2Fpdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d2ce412a8e90366e6564214478911d70e205875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,44,228,18,168,233,3,102,230,86,66,20,71,137,17,215,14,32,88,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
