On one level, that perception is true since he is undoubtedly a gifted pop songwriter, but at his core, Rundgren is a rock &amp; roll maverick. Once he had a taste of success with his 1972 masterwork Something/Anything?, Rundgren chose to abandon stardom and, with it, conventional pop music. He began a course through uncharted musical territory, becoming a pioneer not only in electronic music and prog rock, but in music video, computer software, and Internet music delivery as well. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.94% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 72811\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.We Gotta Get You A Woman\n02.Be Nice To Me\n03.I Saw The Light\n04.Hello, It's Me\n05.Couldn't I Just Tell You\n06.Just One Victory\n07.A Dream Goes On Forever\n08.Real Man\n09.Love Of The Common Man\n10.Love Is The Answer\n11.Love In Action\n12.Can We Still Be Friends\n13.The Very Last Time\n14.Bang The Drum All Day\n15.Something To Fall Back On\n16.The Want Of A Nail (With Bobby Womack)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ba58a26047b0fd8d7b589f38e1d603b941d2fde","amp;dn":"The+Very+Best+Of+Todd+Rundgren+%281997%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ba58a26047b0fd8d7b589f38e1d603b941d2fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,165,138,38,4,123,15,216,215,181,137,243,142,29,96,59,148,29,47,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
