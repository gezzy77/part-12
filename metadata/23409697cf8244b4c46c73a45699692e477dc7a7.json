Speaking for myself, I hold on to the ToCs for archival purposes and to the other bits for their own sake, without having several GBs of extraneous content lying around that's already been re-released in more convenient formats. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23409697cf8244b4c46c73a45699692e477dc7a7","amp;dn":"Dark+Horse+Presents+1-25+%28Cvrs%2BMisc+Only%7C2011-%26gt%3B%7CDgtl%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23409697cf8244b4c46c73a45699692e477dc7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,64,150,151,207,130,68,180,196,108,115,164,86,153,105,46,71,125,199,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
