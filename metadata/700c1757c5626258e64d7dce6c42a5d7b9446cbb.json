Now, in a landmark series, he completes his journey by going back in time to the very roots of the tree of life, in search of the very first animals. Attenborough's journey continues in Canada's Rocky Mountains, where fossils document an explosion in animal diversity never seen before or since. Travelling from there to North Africa, the rainforests of Australia and the east coast of Scotland, Attenborough discovers how animals evolved to conquer not only the oceans but also the land and air. These remote and fascinating creatures are brought to life as never before with the help of cutting-edge scientific technology and photorealistic visual effects. From the first large predators to the first legs on land, these were creatures that evolved the traits and tools that allow all animals, including ourselves, to survive to this day.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 5000 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1440x810\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 2.13 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n\nXvid also available from MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700c1757c5626258e64d7dce6c42a5d7b9446cbb","amp;dn":"BBC+First+Life+2of2+Conquest+810p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700c1757c5626258e64d7dce6c42a5d7b9446cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,12,23,87,197,98,98,88,230,77,125,206,108,66,165,215,185,68,108,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
