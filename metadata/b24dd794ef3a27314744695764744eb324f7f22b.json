This is the series that takes place directly after the Battle of Yavin (or following the events of &quot;A New Hope&quot;). This is NOT &quot;The Star Wars&quot; which is an alternate retelling of the SW Trilogy using Lucas' old scripts. Just to avoid any confusion! I also included the FCBD edition since it was in the original torrent that I've supplemented here. I will also post Star Wars Legacy 1-10 soon, for those interested, since issues 8 and 9 of that series are not on TPB. All credit to Cypher Empire for the scans. Enjoy and please seed, thanks! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b24dd794ef3a27314744695764744eb324f7f22b","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+01-12+%2B+FCBD+%282013%29+%28Digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b24dd794ef3a27314744695764744eb324f7f22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,77,215,148,239,58,39,49,71,68,105,87,100,116,78,179,36,247,242,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
