He definitely lacks the qualities of a good soldier, and he is so afraid of loud noise that he would not last a day in the service, let alone cope with hearing a single gunshot when he is on set shooting a war film at the studio. Colonel Peter Fairbanks (Clarence Kolb) visits the studio set as a consultant for the war film, and with him he has brought his beautiful daughter Antoinett 'Tony' (Dorothy Lamour). Don is smitten by Tony, and also realizes that his ticket out of the Army is to marry the colonelÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter to avoid the draft. But Don manages to insult the colonel gravely when he first mistakes him for an actor and treats him disrespectfully.\n\nEven so, Don manages to go on a date with Tony, and he also proposes to her, before realizing that the drafting age is raised to thirty-five. Since the proposal wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help him stay away from the draft long enough, he retracts his proposal, and Tony is disgusted with him because of his poor intentions and cowardly behavior.\n\nDowned by TonyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bad opinion of him, Don wants to impress her, and decides to pretend to join the Army, using an actor as a fake enlistment officer. But when he is at the drafting office the actor is replaced by a real officer and he, and his assistant Bert (Eddie Bracken) and manager Steve (Lynne Overman), all get enlisted for real. The are forced to a training camp, where Fairbanks is in charge. Fairbanks tells Don that if he can make it up to corporal rank, he gets to marry Tony. This proves to be more than Don and his unfortunate brothers in arms can handle. As punishment for their shortcomings, they are constantly on kitchen patrol. Tony eventually falls in love with Don. When Don and his two companions are left at camp during a camp war game, they come up with the idea to help their team by altering the signposts in the field. The result is disastrous, as the men, and Tony, are led into an artillery range. Don is forced to overcome his fear of noise and rescue Tony. He walks through the lines of fire and takes a shot to the arm. After rescuing Tony, Don and his men are promoted to corporal rank and Don gets permission to marry Tony.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 82 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 82 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c43413817bf1e29a501b270d3f43660ed033c5","amp;dn":"Bob+Hope+Tribute+Collection+-+Caught+in+the+Draft+%281941%29+Xvid+1c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c43413817bf1e29a501b270d3f43660ed033c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,196,52,19,129,123,241,226,154,80,27,39,13,63,67,102,14,208,51,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
