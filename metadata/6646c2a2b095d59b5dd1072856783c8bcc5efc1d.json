Up to now, the duo of Betty (Isabelle Huppert) and Victor (Michel Serrault) have contented themselves to small scams at hotel conventions, such as spiking the drink of a gambler, then rolling him for his winnings after he follows the flirtatious Betty back to his room and passes out. It then develops that, for the past year, without \ntelling Victor, Betty has been plotting an enormous score involving Maurice (FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Cluzet), the treasurer of an international corporation, who&amp;#039;s planning to abscond with a briefcase containing five million Swiss francs in syndicate money. Betty&amp;#039;s plan is for Victor to swap an identical briefcase with Maurice&amp;#039;s and walk away with the jackpot, but Victor becomes suspicious of Betty&amp;#039;s solo venture. Is his once-loyal partner betraying him? What about Maurice, who&amp;#039;s no fool, and his gangster bosses, who will surely want their money returned? A dizzying array of potential double-crosses muddles the question of who&amp;#039;s grifting who in the Betty-Victor-Maurice triangle. Rien Ne Va Plus (1997) screened at several film festivals under the English-language title The Swindle.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Rien ne va plus.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 689 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 947 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 9.33 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 13870/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 3 Low\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 814 Kbps\n      Width : 512 pixels\n      Height : 296 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.213\n      StreamSize : 588 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 91.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.92 \n      Encoding settings : CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6646c2a2b095d59b5dd1072856783c8bcc5efc1d","amp;dn":"Rien+ne+va+plus+-+Chabrol+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6646c2a2b095d59b5dd1072856783c8bcc5efc1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,70,194,162,176,149,213,155,93,209,7,40,86,120,60,139,204,94,252,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
