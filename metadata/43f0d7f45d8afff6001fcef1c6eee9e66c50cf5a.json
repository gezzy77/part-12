But despite dramatic economic progress, ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prospects remain uncertain. In a book sure to provoke debate, Minxin Pei examines the sustainability of the Chinese Communist PartyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reform strategyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½pursuing pro-market economic policies under one-party rule.\n\nPei casts doubt on three central explanations for why ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strategy works: sustained economic development will lead to political liberalization and democratization; gradualist economic transition is a strategy superior to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshock therapyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ prescribed for the former Soviet Union; and a neo-authoritarian developmental state is essential to economic take-off. Pei argues that because the Communist Party must retain significant economic control to ensure its political survival, gradualism will ultimately fail.\n\nThe lack of democratic reforms in China has led to pervasive corruption and a breakdown in political accountability. What has emerged is a decentralized predatory state in which local party bosses have effectively privatized the stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s authority. Collusive corruption is widespread and governance is deteriorating. Instead of evolving toward a full market economy, China is trapped in partial economic and political reforms.\n\nCombining powerful insights with empirical research, ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trapped Transition offers a provocative assessment of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future as a great power.\n\nJanuary 2008\nPublisher: Harvard University Press\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f0d7f45d8afff6001fcef1c6eee9e66c50cf5a","amp;dn":"China%5C%27s+Trapped+Transition+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f0d7f45d8afff6001fcef1c6eee9e66c50cf5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,240,215,244,93,138,255,246,0,31,206,241,198,238,233,230,108,80,207,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
