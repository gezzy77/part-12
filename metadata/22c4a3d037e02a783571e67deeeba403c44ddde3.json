The America we are accustomed to is no more. Practically overnight the stock market has plum-meted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as Ã‚â€œthe CrunchÃ‚â€ has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive.\n    ISBN13: 9781439172810\n    ISBN10: 1439172811\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c4a3d037e02a783571e67deeeba403c44ddde3","amp;dn":"Survivors+-+James+Wesley+Rawles+epub+%28steelballz%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c4a3d037e02a783571e67deeeba403c44ddde3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,196,163,208,55,224,42,120,53,113,230,125,238,235,164,3,196,77,221,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
