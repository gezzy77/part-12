ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay; the idea of testing JavaScript is a relatively new thing. And unfortunately, there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too many Ã¢â‚¬Å“hold your handÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ resources for getting up and running. Well, that all changes with this course. We start from scratch, and slowly work our way up the testing chain.\nAlong the way, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take advantage of the fantastic Jasmine BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework to make our tests as readable as possible. Upon completion of the course, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only have a robust test suite at your fingertips, but your tests will also make for fantastic documentation!\n\nInfo: https://tutsplus.com/course/javascript-testing-with-jasmine-2/\n\nPlease SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.
