When his all-too-human lover is found murdered on the eve of the coven's annual Four Hundred Ball--a celebration meant to usher in a new era in vampire society, and to mark the re-unification of the Coven after decades of unrest and decay--Oliver is devastated.\n\nNow, not only is he trying to create a new world order for the immortal elite, he's the prime suspect and is stalked by the newly installed head of the vampire secret police. Because according to the new rules, vampires who take human life can now be executed. Burned.\n\nHow can an immortal sentenced to die fight back? He has to find the killer--and the answers lie deep in vampire lore.\n\n- - -\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF\nASIN#: B00HQ2N1LU\nISBN#: 1401330819\nISBN13#: 9781401330811\nPublished: September 9th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7016a27f5361cb909f1ee7ab259f0c96dce42d4","amp;dn":"The+Vampires+of+Manhattan+%28Vampires+of+Manhattan+%231%29+-+Melissa+d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7016a27f5361cb909f1ee7ab259f0c96dce42d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,1,106,39,245,54,28,185,9,241,238,122,178,89,240,201,109,206,66,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
