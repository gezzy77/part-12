And get ready for a thrilling, true story that will make you rethink who the good guys and bad guys have been since 9/11. \nNo company in our time has been as mysterious or as controversial as Blackwater. Founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince in 1997, it recruited special forces veterans and others with the skills and courage to take on the riskiest security jobs in the world. As its reputation grew, government demand for its services escalated, and BlackwaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men eventually completed nearly one hundred thousand missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both the Bush and Obama administrations found the company indispensible. \nIt sounds like a classic startup success story, except for one problem: Blackwater has been demonized around the world. From uninformed news coverage to grossly distorted fictional portrayals, Blackwater employees have been smeared as mercenaries, profiteers, jackbooted thugs, and worse. \nBecause of the secrecy requirements of BlackwaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contracts with the Pentagon, the State Department, and the CIA, Prince was unable to speak out when his companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opponents spread false information. But now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s able to tell the full and often shocking story of BlackwaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise and fall. \nIn Civilian Warriors, Prince pulls no punches and spares no details. He explains his original goal of building an elite center for military and law enforcement training. He recounts how the company shifted gears after 9/11. He honors our troops while challenging the PentagonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top leadership. And he reveals why highly efficient private military contractors have been essential to running our armed forces, since long before Blackwater came along.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a34972e4a7c1027c52f459743eb722ec9e179ec","amp;dn":"Civilian+Warriors+The+Inside+Story+of+Blackwater+and+the+Unsung+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a34972e4a7c1027c52f459743eb722ec9e179ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,52,151,46,74,124,16,39,197,47,69,151,67,235,114,46,201,225,121,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
