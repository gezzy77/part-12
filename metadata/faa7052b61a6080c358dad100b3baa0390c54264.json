The band's hits include covers of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot;. After forming in 1971 and despite a short hiatus in the late 80s/early 90s, the Earth Band has continued to perform and tour through the present.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Roaring Silence is an album released in 1976 by Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Like other Earth Band albums, this includes material by other composers. &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;, which reached number one in Billboard's Hot 100, is a cover version of a song by Bruce Springsteen; &quot;Questions&quot; is based on the main theme of Franz Schubert's Impromptu in G flat Major; &quot;Starbird&quot; takes its theme from Igor Stravinsky's ballet The Firebird. This album also marked the arrival of vocalist/guitarist Chris Hamlet Thompson.\n\nThe main riff of &quot;Waiter, There's a Yawn in My Ear&quot; is taken from the Manfred Mann Chapter Three track &quot;Fish&quot; which was recorded for their abandoned third album. It was ultimately released in 2005 on the Odds &amp; Sods Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mis-takes &amp; Out-takes box set.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBand:\n\nManfred Mann: keyboards, backing vocals\nColin Pattenden: bass\nDave Flett: lead guitar\nChris Hamlet Thompson: vocals, guitar\nChris Slade: drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nWith:\n\nDoreen Chanter: backing vocals\nIrene Chanter: backing vocals\nSusanne Lynch: backing vocals\nMick Rogers: backing vocals\nBarbara Thompson: saxophone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa7052b61a6080c358dad100b3baa0390c54264","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann%27s%2FThe+Roaring+Silence%5B1976%2F2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BLE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa7052b61a6080c358dad100b3baa0390c54264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,167,5,43,97,166,8,12,53,141,173,16,11,59,170,3,144,197,66,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
