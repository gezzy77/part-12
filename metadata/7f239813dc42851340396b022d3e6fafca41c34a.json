JLG muses about in his home in Rolle, Switzerland in the dead of winter. He suffers the rude interruption of critics and the cheeky services of a pretty maid while contemplating the end of western culture, cinema, and himself. A busy day... but still with time for tragedy, tennis and television.\n\nVideo Codec:XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1253 Kbps\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224\nResolution: 640 x 480\nFrame Rate: 25.000 FPS\n\nPLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f239813dc42851340396b022d3e6fafca41c34a","amp;dn":"JLG%2FJLG+-+autoportrait+de+d%C3%83%C2%A9cembre+-+Jean-Luc+Godard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f239813dc42851340396b022d3e6fafca41c34a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,35,152,19,220,66,133,19,64,57,107,2,45,62,111,175,202,65,195,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
