The best one-volume treatment of the subject now in existence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Historian\nThe Roman army was one of the most successful fighting forces in history. Its organization and tactics were highly advanced and were unequaled until the modern era. Spectacular monuments to its perseverance and engineering skill are still visible today, most notably HadrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wall and the siegeworks around the fortress of Masada.\n\nThis book is the first to examine in detail not just the early imperial army but also the citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ militia of the Republic and the army of the later Empire. The unprecedented scope and longevity of Roman military success is placed in the context of ordinary soldiersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ daily lives, whether spent in the quiet routine of a peaceful garrison or in arduous campaign and violent combat. Key battles and tactics are described, and there are brief biographies of the great commanders.\n\nDrawing on archaeology, ancient art, and original documentary sources, this book presents the most convincing history ever published of the Roman army. 107 full-color and 147 black-and-white illustrations\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Roman-Army-Series/dp/0500288992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371576266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+roman+army&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Roman-Army-Series/dp/0500288992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371576266&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+complete+roman+army&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cea7d3996c8176277ebfd0369e93473b318ac168","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Roman+Army+-+Goldsworthy.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cea7d3996c8176277ebfd0369e93473b318ac168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,167,211,153,108,129,118,39,126,191,208,54,158,147,71,59,49,138,193,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
