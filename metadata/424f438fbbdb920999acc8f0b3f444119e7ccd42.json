It is a piece of film history and is important for a number of reasons.  It was featured in Thom Andersen's film called &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself.&quot;\n\n   Available only on sources such as these file shares,  &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself&quot; is considered a masterpiece.  It tells how the City of Los Angeles plays a role in film developement and content.\n\n   What I've tried to do is find all of the films referred to in &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself&quot; for personal viewing to get a better understanding of the Thom Andersen film.  In most file share versions of the Andersen film,  &quot;The Exiles&quot; begins the second cd rip.  The digitizing of &quot;Los Angeles Plays Itself&quot; originates with a VHS only edition.  It cannot be distributed due to the vast amount of licensing that studios demand for clips of their product.\n\n  From Andersen's film I requested that my local library buy &quot;The Exiles.&quot;   It is a rich DVD set which features commentary, shorts and features by Kent MacKenzie and a separate documentary about Bunker Hill.\n\n   &quot;The Exiles&quot; takes place in the early 60's and shows how displaced of Native Americans live in the city of Los Angeles.  It has both documentary and dramatic elements and has been preserved by Milestone Productions through the work of the UCLA Film and Television archive. \n\n   The Milestone release has two discs.  Please encourage your libraries to acquire the full release.\n\n IMDb entry for The Exiles: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054861/\n Wiki entry for The Exiles: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exiles_%281961_film%29\n\nNew Torrent January 7th, 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:424f438fbbdb920999acc8f0b3f444119e7ccd42","amp;dn":"The+Exiles+%281961%29+by+Kent+MacKenzie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"424f438fbbdb920999acc8f0b3f444119e7ccd42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,79,67,143,187,219,146,9,153,172,200,240,179,244,68,17,158,124,205,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
