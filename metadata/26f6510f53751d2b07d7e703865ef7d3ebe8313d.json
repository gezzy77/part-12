There are countless compilations of Hooker material on the market, issued by a variety of labels under assorted different titles, but you really can't go wrong with this guy -- he always delivered what he was supposed to deliver with no frills and no fuss.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f6510f53751d2b07d7e703865ef7d3ebe8313d","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+Blues+From+The+Motor+City+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f6510f53751d2b07d7e703865ef7d3ebe8313d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,246,81,15,83,117,29,43,7,215,231,3,134,94,247,211,235,232,49,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
