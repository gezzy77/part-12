The Banshees' post-1982 singles (documented in entirety on Twice Upon a Time) have a lush and expansive sound that directly influenced the goth sound. \nFrom the opening of &quot;Fireworks&quot; it is immediately apparent that Siouxsie and the Banshees were growing up. By the time of &quot;Peek-a-Boo,&quot; the band had learned how to incorporate its early dissonance with its majestic, late-'80s sound. \nThe Twice Upon a Time collection is one great step after another, with the only drawback being a poor remix of 1991's &quot;Fear of the Unknown.&quot; A solid introduction for the unknowing.
