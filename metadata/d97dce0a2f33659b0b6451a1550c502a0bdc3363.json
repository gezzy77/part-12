From politicians to hedge-fund managers to middle-class IRA holders, everyone must pay attention to how and why the global economy works the way it does.\n\n Enter Financial Times columnist and bestselling author Tim Harford. In this new book that demystifies macroeconomics, Harford strips away the spin, the hype, and the jargon to reveal the truth about how the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy actually works. With the wit of a raconteur and the clear grasp of an expert, Harford explains whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really happening beyond todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headlines, why all of us should care, and what we can do about it to understand it better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97dce0a2f33659b0b6451a1550c502a0bdc3363","amp;dn":"The+Undercover+Economist+Strikes+Back+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97dce0a2f33659b0b6451a1550c502a0bdc3363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,125,206,10,47,51,101,155,11,100,81,161,85,12,80,42,11,220,51,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
