Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed &quot;Lynchian&quot;, and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous sound design. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they &quot;disturb, offend or mystify&quot; their audiences.\n\nThis Filmography contains\n\n2010:   Lady Blue Shanghai\n2007: \tBoat \n2007: \tAbsurda \n2007:   Lynch One\n2007: \tMore Things That Happened \n2007: \tDynamic:01: The Best of DavidLynch.com \n2007: \tChacun son cinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ma ou Ce petit coup au coeur quand la lumiere \n2006: \tInland Empire \n2002: \tPrzyciemniony pokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³j (Darkened Room) \n2002: \tShort Films of David Lynch, The \n2002: \tDumbland \n2002: \tRabbits\n2001: \tMulholland Dr.\n1999: \tStraight Story\n1997: \tLost Highway \n1995: \tLumiere et compagnie\n1993: \tHotel Room \n1992: \tTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\n1990: \tWild at Heart\n1990: \tTwin Peaks\n1990: \tIndustrial Symphony No. 1: The Dream of the Broken Hearted\n1990: \tTwin Peaks\n1989: \tCowboy and the frenchman\n1986: \tBlue Velvet \n1984: \tDune\n1980: \tElephant Man\n1977: \tEraserhead\n1974: \tAmputee\n1970: \tGrandmother\n1968: \tAlphabet\n1966: \tSix Figures Getting Sick\n\n\nThe Elephant Man,Eraserhead,Dune,Wild At Heart,Inland Empire,Lost Highway,Blue velvet has dual version SD (DVDRip) and Highres though the source used is UNCONFIRMED.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a920d31e817c9bddac6739f832e505a8f35428f","amp;dn":"David+Lynch+Complete+Filmography+1967+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a920d31e817c9bddac6739f832e505a8f35428f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,146,13,49,232,23,201,189,218,198,115,159,131,46,80,90,143,53,66,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
