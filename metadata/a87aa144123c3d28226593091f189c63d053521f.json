After Donovan, the Incredible String Band, the Pentangle and a few more, came this Glaswegian trio called String Driven Thing in 67, composed of Chris Adams and his wife and guitarist John Mannion. While they stayed rather unsuccessful for a long while, with their debut album completely unnoticed on a independent label. By 71, the group had seen Mannion leaving, but he was replaced with violinist Grahame Smith and bassist Colin Wilson. Soon they got signed to the Charisma label and with Shel Talmy producing two excellent albums, encountering a certain kind of success in Continental Europe, but staying close to unknown in the Isles. After health-related problems in a tour founder Chris Adams quit with his wife leaving Grahame Smith reforming the group from scratch for two further albums. Neither of these albums will have the charm or adventure of the two earlier albums, developing a more AOR rock that had no real distinction except for a violin sound and the group folded in the mis-70's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87aa144123c3d28226593091f189c63d053521f","amp;dn":"String+Driven+Thing+-+String+Driven+Thing++%281972%2F1995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87aa144123c3d28226593091f189c63d053521f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,122,161,68,18,60,61,40,34,101,147,9,31,24,156,99,208,83,82,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
