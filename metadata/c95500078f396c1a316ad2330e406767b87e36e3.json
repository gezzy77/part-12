Born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox began playing music as child, learning how to play both the piano and flute. In her late teens, she won a scholarship to London's Royal Academy of Music, but she dropped out of the school before she took her finals. For the next several years, she worked around London, performing various jobs during the day and singing at night. In the late '70s, she met guitarist Dave Stewart through a friend. Stewart, who had previously played with Longdancer, asked Lennox to join a new band he was forming with a songwriter named Peet Coombes. The band was named the Tourists, and they released three albums between 1979 and 1980 and scored a number four U.K. hit with a cover of Dusty Springfield's &quot;I Only Want to Be with You.&quot; \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tArista\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.No More I Love You's\n02.Take Me To The River\n03.A Whiter Shade Of Pale\n04.Don't Let It Bring You Down\n05.Train In Vain\n06.I Can't Get Next To You\n07.Downtown Lights\n08.Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n09.Waiting In Vain\n10.Something So Right\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c95500078f396c1a316ad2330e406767b87e36e3","amp;dn":"Annie+Lennox+-+Medusa+%281995%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c95500078f396c1a316ad2330e406767b87e36e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,85,0,7,143,57,108,26,49,106,210,51,14,64,103,103,184,126,54,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
