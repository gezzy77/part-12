I don't usually care for the newer episodes, but I love the classic 1970s version.\n\nHere's a rare episode from the show's very first season (1969-70). The show got a lot more polished in its second and third season, but first season is my favorite...messed up scary Jim Henson Muppet monsters everywhere, including early versions of the monsters that would evolve into Cookie and Grover. This probably won't scare your kids unless they are under 3 or so...every kid I've shown this episode to has loved it.\n\n\nA list of all the songs and sketches in this episode can be found here: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_0043\n\nIf you's like to see more classic Sesame Street episodes from the show's early years, let me know in the comments, and show your support by continuing to seed for as long as possible!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e98f2d1a7b42a3a5899ef6cfefd89ca546d1d5","amp;dn":"Sesame+Street+-+Episode+0043+%28Jan+07+1970%29+VHSrip+XviD+%5BNanto%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e98f2d1a7b42a3a5899ef6cfefd89ca546d1d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,233,143,45,26,123,66,163,165,137,158,246,207,239,216,156,165,70,209,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
