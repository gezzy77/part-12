Now, for the first time, developers have a comprehensive and authoritative guide to applying LINQ to Objects in real-world software. Microsoft MVP Troy Magennis introduces state-of-the-art techniques for working with in-memory collections more elegantly and efficientlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and writing code that is exceptionally powerful, robust, and flexible. \n\n Drawing on his unsurpassed experience coding software using LINQ and hosting the popular HookedOnLINQ.com site, Magennis presents timely, realistic solutions to a wide spectrum of development challenges, such as combining data from multiple sources, and achieving optimal performance with extremely large sets of data. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll begin with brief quick-starts that walk you through LINQ to ObjectsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ key features and query syntax. Next, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll drill down to detailed techniques for applying and extending these features with C# 4.0 and C# 3.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including code examples that reflect the realities of production development.\n\n Coverage includes \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Writing basic LINQ queries with C#: filtering, projecting, and sorting data from in-memory collections\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mastering advanced techniques for grouping and joining data and understanding the performance implications of each technique\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Taking full advantage of LINQÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standard query operators \n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Creating custom query operators that follow best practices for coding patterns and error handling\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Writing more fluent, readable LINQ queries with C# 4.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s language enhancements, including the new dynamic features\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Combining LINQ with COM-Interop to access data sources such as Microsoft Excel\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Using Parallel LINQ to Objects (PLINQ) to optimize queries for multi-core processors, and how to build custom parallel query operators\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Integrating the best LINQ to Objects patterns into your day-to-day coding \n\n About the Author\n Troy Magennis is a Microsoft C# MVP and a keen traveler who currently works for Travelocity, which manages the travel and leisure websites travelocity.com, lastminute.com, and zuji. As Vice President of Architecture, he leads a talented team of architects spread across four continents, committed to being the travelerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s champion. Technology has always been a passion. After cutting his teeth on early 8-bit personal computers, Troy moved into electronic engineering (assembly language coding), which later led to positions in software application development and architecture for some of the most prominent corporations in automotive, banking, and online commerce. TroyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first exposure to LINQ was in 2006 when he took a sabbatical to learn it and became hooked, ultimately leading him to publish the popular HookedOnLINQ website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28a2234ea81fcbbc7c4824211f34204abdc25c9","amp;dn":"LINQ+to+Objects+Using+C%23+4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28a2234ea81fcbbc7c4824211f34204abdc25c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,138,34,52,234,129,252,187,199,196,130,66,17,243,66,4,171,220,37,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
