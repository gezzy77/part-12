Included are two sessions originally cut for Prestige's subsidiary Moodsville (Nice an' Cool and The Soulful Mood of Gene Ammons), which are purposely relaxed and strictly at ballad tempos. Fortunately, Ammons (who had a distinctive, huge tone) was long a master at interpreting ballads, and although these performances do not quite reach the heights of his greatest recordings, the lyrical music is quite enjoyable. Accompanied by either Richard Wyands or Patti Bown on piano, Doug Watkins or George Duvivier on bass, and J.C. Heard or Ed Shaughnessy on drums, Ammons is tasteful and creative in a subtle way throughout these successful dates. (AllMusic)\nA compilation of two previously released albums, the 1961 &quot;Nice an' cool&quot; (A and B) and the 1962 &quot;The soulful mood of Gene Ammons&quot; (C and D).\n\nTrack list:\nA\n01 - Till There Was You\n02 - Answer Me, My Love\n03 - Willow Weep for Me\n04 - Little Girl Blue\nB\n05 - Something I Dreamed Last Night\n06 - Something Wonderful\n07 - I Remember You\n08 - Someone to Watch over Me\nC\n09 - Two Different Worlds\n10 - But Beautiful\n11 - Skylark\n12 - Three Little Words\nD\n13 - Street of Dreams\n14 - You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To\n15 - Under a Blanket of Blue\n16 - I'm Glad There Is You\n\nPersonnel:\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Doug Watkins (tracks: A1 to B4), George Duvivier (tracks: C1 to D4)\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ed Shaughnessy (tracks: C1 to D4), J.C.
