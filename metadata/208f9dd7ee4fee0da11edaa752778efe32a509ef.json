In their quest, their paths will cross with the original cast of Tales of Symphonia including Lloyd and Colette, as well as a summon spirit known as Ratatosk who claims to be the lord of all monsters. \n\nDawn of the New World introduces a new monster recruitment feature in which players can capture more than 200 unique enemies and train them to actively participate in battle. Players can then feed these monsters to make them more effective, and even evolve them into several new fearsome forms. The game also features an updated real-time battle system that lets players move freely in all directions around the battlefield, execute powerful unison attacks and take advantage of a new elemental alignment system for even more strategic depth. \nESRB Rating: T for Alcohol Reference, Fantasy Violence, Mild Language, Suggestive Themes \nGenre: RPG \nExclusively on Wii \nRelease Date: November 11, 2008 \nMSRP: $39.99 \nUnreleased \nDecember 31, 2008 \nFeatures \nEditions \n\nGeneral Features \n\n* Classic Tales ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Return to the world of Tales of Symphonia and discover the aftermath of the merging of the two worlds \n* Over 200 unique monsters ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Capture, collect, and feed monsters as they grow, gain experience and even evolve into completely new, more powerful beasts \n* Enhanced for the Wii ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Environments, characters and effects look better than ever \n* Evolved Battle System ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The Tales RPG trademark real-time battle system returns with an all-new free run system, dynamic unison attacks and a strategic elemental system \n* It's your Party ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Customize the party with unlimited combinations of monsters and characters throughout the adventure \n* A decade of Tales ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Celebrating the Tales 10 year anniversary in North America","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:208f9dd7ee4fee0da11edaa752778efe32a509ef","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Symphonia+-+Dawn+of+the+New+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"208f9dd7ee4fee0da11edaa752778efe32a509ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,143,157,215,238,79,238,13,161,30,218,167,82,119,142,254,50,165,9,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
