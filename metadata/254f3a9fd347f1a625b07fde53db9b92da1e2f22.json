The Roman Empire is at the height of its power, under the \nrule of the cruel Emperor Nero. The isle of Britannia is wracked by \nrebellion against its Roman masters, as the Celtic \ntribes ransack city after city.\nIn the depths of the wilderness, the village of Nethergate, forgotten and \nignored, is hatching a conspiracy. They will conspire with the faery \nkingdoms, the dark, secret, wild powers, to destroy their Roman conquerors. \nMagic is dying, but there is enough of it left to put an end the the Empire. \nYour job is to help them.\nOr, your job is to stop them.\nIn Nethergate, the newest role-playing game from Spiderweb Software, the \nmakers of the award-winning Exile series, you can play as either the Romans \nor the Celts, seeing both sides of this epic battle. The quests, puzzles, \nand the way the characters react to you will be completely different. It's \nlike two games in one!\nNo matter which side you play, Nethergate has beautiful 3-D graphics, an \nelegant interface, a huge world, based on historical research, and dozens of \ncunning towns, fortresses, and dungeons. Nethergate has dozens of characters \nand over 150,000 words of plotting and dialogue, designed to immerse you in \na strange, magical, lost world.\n\nNethergate requires a PC running Windows 95/98/NT/2000 or a PowerPC \nMacintosh (minimum 80Mhz, 8 MB free RAM, 16 bit color). This game is not \ncompatible with Intel-based Macintoshes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:254f3a9fd347f1a625b07fde53db9b92da1e2f22","amp;dn":"Nethergate_Classic_Full-FFF.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"254f3a9fd347f1a625b07fde53db9b92da1e2f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,79,58,159,211,71,241,166,37,176,127,222,83,219,155,146,218,30,47,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
