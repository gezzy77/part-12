While James soaked up the Delta during his sessions at Sun (and was nominated for a Grammy for that record), his stop at Electric Lady Studios in New York, is filled with urban, postwar classics played with a sharp edge.\n\nNo Escape from the Blues features Ulmer in a unique role, that of the blues singer and shouter. Never has he sounded so expressive, emotionally compelling, or convincing vocally; and his guitar playing, while less present here than on his other recordings, is still there, snaking its way through this weird yet wonderful set. \n\nIt only takes one listen to prove that there is No Escape from the\nBlues. Whether taking a spin on a blues standard or weaving a tale of his own, Ulmer's fret work and thick vocals are nothing short of classic. Ulmer mayhave left the blues behind when he moved north decades ago, but his journey reaffirms the title of this album with ease. Ulmer couldn't run from the blues because he has lived them.\n\nHighly recommended. This recording is indeed &quot;future blues.&quot;\n\n\n\nJAMES BLOOD ULMER\n\nNo Escape from the Blues\nThe Electric Lady Sessions\n\n\n- CD\n- 2003\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nJames Blood Ulmer, guitar, vocals\nwith\nVernon Reid, guitar, electric sitar, banjo\nLeon Gruenbaum, piano, Hammond B-3, Wurlitzer, Fender Rhodes, melodica\nCharlie Burnham, electric fiddle, mandolin\nDavid Barnes, harmonica\nMark Peterson, acoustic, electric bass\nAubrey Dale, drums\nQueen Esther, vocals\nOlu Dara, pocket trumpet\nMaya Smullyan Jenkins, tap dancing\nJohn Kruth, tamboura\n\n\nRecorded on April 23, 24, 25,  2003 at Electric Lady Studios, NYC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f35dd279776a13d8641748d851cdc11226efe0a","amp;dn":"James+%27Blood%27+Ulmer+-+No+Escape+from+the+Blues+The+Electric+Lady","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f35dd279776a13d8641748d851cdc11226efe0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,53,221,39,151,118,161,61,134,65,116,141,133,28,220,17,34,110,254,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
