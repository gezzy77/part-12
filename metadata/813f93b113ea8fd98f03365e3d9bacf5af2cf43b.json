Actually, he was much more than &quot;fatha fo stride,&quot; as he was known. He was an innovator and teacher. Duke Ellington was one of many famous pupils. It's a shame that while everybody has heard of Rhapsody In Blue, not many people know of Johnson's piece, Yamekraw - A Negro Rhapsody. Enjoy. &quot;...it was me, or maybe Fats, who sat down to warm up the piano. After that, James took over. Then you got real invention - magic, sheer magic,&quot; Duke Ellington - back cover of &quot;the original james p. johnson: 1942-1945 solos (one of the cds in this torrent). The title of this torrent is not from a CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:813f93b113ea8fd98f03365e3d9bacf5af2cf43b","amp;dn":"James+P+Johnson+Jazz+Piano+Innovator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"813f93b113ea8fd98f03365e3d9bacf5af2cf43b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,63,147,177,19,234,143,217,143,3,54,94,61,155,172,245,175,44,244,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
