The real star of the show, though, is the production: sparkling, convoluted, designed to sound deeply oh-wow under the influence--and pretty great sober too--with David Gilmour getting lots of space for his most lyrical guitar playing ever. And, though the album is big and ambitious, even bombastic, it somehow dodges being pretentious--the Barrett tributes are honest and heartfelt, beneath all the grand gestures and stereophonic trickery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfa61a55b43e22584751d421d28d4733f18b656","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Wish+you+were+here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfa61a55b43e22584751d421d28d4733f18b656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,250,97,165,91,67,226,37,132,117,29,66,29,40,212,115,63,24,182,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
