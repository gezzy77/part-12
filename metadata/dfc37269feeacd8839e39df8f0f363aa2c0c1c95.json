Their craftsmanship was not limited to the frame, but included hand-made derailleurs, brakes, stems, racks and other components. The entire bicycle was carefully designed and crafted as a unit, combining function and beauty.\nWith lavish color photography, 'The Golden Age of Handbuilt Bicycles' charts the development of theses machines from the early 1900Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s through the present day. Additional historic photos show the bikes in competition and with their original owners. Insightful descriptiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ns set the scene for each bicycle and explain its details. Here you find machines with a level of craftsmanship that never has been surpassed.\n\nJan Heine is editor of 'Bicycle Quarterly', a magazine about the history and technology of cyling.\nJean-Pierre PradÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨resÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´ photography has been published in many magazines and books, including the Guggenheim MuseumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s 'The Art of the Motorcycle'.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· &quot;The most wonderful, fascinating, fabulous bicycle book ever published!&quot;\nOregon Cycling\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· &quot;Simply the most beautiful bike book ever!&quot;\nOut Your Backdoor\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· &quot; Exceptional photography, a pleasure to read and view&quot;\ncyclingnews.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc37269feeacd8839e39df8f0f363aa2c0c1c95","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Age+of+Handbuilt+Bicycles+%5BEN%5D+%2F+%2F+bicicleta+bicycle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc37269feeacd8839e39df8f0f363aa2c0c1c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,195,114,105,254,234,205,136,57,227,157,248,240,243,99,170,44,12,28,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
