New chapters, examples, and insights; all infused with the timeless concepts and theories that have helped RF engineers for the past 25 years!\n\nRF circuit design is now more important than ever as we find ourselves in an increasingly wireless world. Radio is the backbone of today's wireless industry with protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMax, and ZigBee. Most, if not all, mobile devices have an RF component and this book tells the reader how to design and integrate that component in a very practical fashion. This book has been updated to include today's integrated circuit (IC) and system-level design issues as well as keeping its classic &quot;wire lead&quot; material.\n\nDesign Concepts and Tools Include\n\n.The Basics: Wires, Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors\n.Resonant Circuits: Resonance, Insertion Loss\n.Filter Design: High-pass, Bandpass, Band-rejection\n.Impedance Matching: The L Network, Smith Charts, Software Design Tools\n.Transistors: Materials, Y Parameters, S Parameters\n.Small Signal RF Amplifier: Transistor Biasing, Y Parameters, S Parameters\n.RF Power Amplifiers: Automatic Shutdown Circuitry , Broadband Transformers, Practical Winding Hints\n.RF Front-End: Architectures, Software-Defined Radios, ADC's Effects\n.RF Design Tools: Languages, Flow, Modeling\n\n\nCheck out this book's companion Web site at: http://books.elsevier.com/9780750685184 for full-color Smith Charts and extra content!\n\n*Completely updated but still contains its classic timeless information\n*Two NEW chapters on RF Front-End Design and RF Design Tools\n*Not overly math intensive, perfect for the working RF and digital professional that need to build analog-RF-Wireless circuits\nFrom the Publisher\nRF Circuit Design is essential reading for experts in the field of RF circuit design and engineers needing a good reference. This book provides complete design procedures for multiple-pole Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel filters. It also covers capacitors, inductors, and other components with their behavior at RF frequencies discussed in detail. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Newnes; 2 edition (November 2, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0750685182\n# ISBN-13: 978-0750685184","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b13ad87ff283839aa349025816d9c0f011c1beb","amp;dn":"Radio+Frequency+Circuit+Design+2nd+Edition%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b13ad87ff283839aa349025816d9c0f011c1beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,19,173,135,255,40,56,57,170,52,144,37,129,109,156,15,1,28,27,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
