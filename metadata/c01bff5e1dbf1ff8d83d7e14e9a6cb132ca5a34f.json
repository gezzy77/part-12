It will give students a good grasp of what the atmosphere and oceans look like on the large-scale and why they look that way. The role of the oceans in climate and paleoclimate is also discussed. The combination of observations, theory and accompanying illustrative laboratory experiments sets this text apart by making it accessible to students with no prior training in meteorology or oceanography.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01bff5e1dbf1ff8d83d7e14e9a6cb132ca5a34f","amp;dn":"Physics+of+The+Earth%5C%27s+Interior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01bff5e1dbf1ff8d83d7e14e9a6cb132ca5a34f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,27,255,94,29,191,31,248,216,61,126,20,233,166,203,19,44,165,163,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
