But the beautiful entertainer accused of the crime enlists the help of Father Mateo, the Portuguese Jesuit Hiro is sworn to protect, leaving the master shinobi with just three days to find the killer in order to save the girl and the priest from execution.\n\nThe investigation plunges Hiro and Father Mateo into the dangerous waters of KyotoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s floating world, where they learn that everyone from the elusive teahouse owner to the dead manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dishonored brother has a motive to keep the samuraiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death a mystery. \n\nA rare murder weapon favored by ninja assassins, a female samurai warrior, and a hidden affair leave Hiro with too many suspects and far too little time. Worse, the ninjaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation uncovers a host of secrets that threaten not only Father Mateo and the teahouse, but the very future of Japan.\n\nDebut author Susan Spann delivers a riveting mystery filled with rich period detail and a fine sense of Japanese culture. Claws of the Cat boasts a detective like no other and a world never seen before in crime fiction.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bf1ba2471f6bfb50ae10b411477ed5c99eb8dd","amp;dn":"Claws+of+the+Cat+by+Susan+Spann+%28Shinobi+Mystery+%231%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bf1ba2471f6bfb50ae10b411477ed5c99eb8dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,191,27,162,71,31,107,251,80,174,16,180,17,71,126,213,201,158,184,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
