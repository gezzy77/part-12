L. Krasnov, G. I. Makarenko, A. I. Kiselev . \n\nThe calculus of variations is one of the most important divisions of\nclassical mathematical analysis as regards applications.The authors'\naim was to supply the reader with a certain minimum of problems\ncovering the basic divisions of the classical calculus of variations,\nand they deliberately avoided questions pertaining to the theory of\noptimal control. \n\n\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The book\n  was published by first Mir Publishers in 1975. \n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 3.1 MB | Pages: 221 | Bookmarked | OCR\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 6\nPreliminary Remarks 7\n\nCHAPTER I. \nTHE EXTREMUM OF A FUNCTION OF MANY VARIABLES\n\n1.
