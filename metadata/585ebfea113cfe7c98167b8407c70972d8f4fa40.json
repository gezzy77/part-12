It covers transformations of sugars into green chemicals in pharmaceuticals, biodegradable polymers and surfactants. A special chapter is dedicated to the conversion of biomass into sugars, which is a crucial step in the sustainable utilization of sugars. The book is a valuable resource for chemists and chemical engineers working to develop greener synthetic routes to chemicals and pharmaceuticals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585ebfea113cfe7c98167b8407c70972d8f4fa40","amp;dn":"Biomass+Sugars+for+Non-Fuel+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585ebfea113cfe7c98167b8407c70972d8f4fa40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,94,191,234,17,60,254,124,152,22,123,132,7,199,9,114,216,244,250,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
