It is arguably the least\nsimilar to other tracks on the album [except for Satan], which for the\nmost part carry folk rock or progressive rock moods. This version of\n&quot;Monkey&quot; also may be the first Gothic Rock track Robert Plant has ever\nrecorded, and although it is not a staple at Plant's live performances\nthere have been instances where he has performed it.\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - Angel Dance [03:19]\n  02 - House of Cards [04:01]\n  03 - Central Two-O-Nine [03:09]\n  04 - Silver Rider [03:50]\n  05 - You Can't Buy My Love [05:08]\n  06 - Falling in Love Again [06:52]\n  07 - The Only Sound That Matters [03:34]\n  08 - Monkey [03:23]\n  09 - Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday [03:13]\n  10 - Harm's Swift Way [03:21]\n  11 - Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down [04:03]\n  12 - Even This Shall Pass Away [04:39]\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Robert Plant\nGenre: Folk rock, roots rock, country rock\nAlbum Release Year: 2010\nLabel: Universal Music\nBarcode: 602527483313\nNumber of Tracks: 12\nTotal Duration: 47:39.867 (126 120 120 samples)\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 904 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 310 MB (325,506,372 bytes)\n\nPosted Image\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50455ec212df0a8ba49b9b2b512054ff0a1c1814","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Band+Of+Joy+2010+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50455ec212df0a8ba49b9b2b512054ff0a1c1814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,69,94,194,18,223,10,139,164,155,155,43,81,32,84,255,10,28,24,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
