The recording was the band's highest landmark in terms of album sales, and was the closest they would come to ever achieving mainstream success. Sweet Oblivion managed to sell in excess of 300,000+ copies on the strength of &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot;. The band's biggest hit, it benefitted from an appearance on the Singles soundtrack, a Top Ten, platinum-selling hit album which featured many other popular Seattle-based music acts from the time period.\nPersonnel changes around the time of the album also led to the replacing of original drummer Mark Pickerel, who left to pursue other musical interests, with Barrett Martin. Four years would pass in between Sweet Oblivion and the band's follow-up album, Dust, a move that arguably hurt much of the Trees' commercial momentum.\n\n01 Shadow of the Season\t4:34\n02 Nearly Lost You\t4:07\n03 Dollar Bill\t4:35\n04 More or Less 3:11\n05 Butterfly\t3:22\n06 For Celebrations Past\t4:09\n07 The Secret Kind\t3:08\n08 Winter Song\t3:43\n09 Troubled Times\t5:20\n10 No One Knows\t5:13\n11 Julie Paradise\t5:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1306e6f12f7aafc80016d25226059275862814","amp;dn":"Screaming+Trees-+%281992%29+Sweet+Oblivion++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1306e6f12f7aafc80016d25226059275862814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,19,6,230,241,47,122,175,200,0,22,210,82,38,5,146,117,134,40,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
