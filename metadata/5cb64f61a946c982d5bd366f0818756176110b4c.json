It sounds like a needledrop. It is listenable, but the sound could be better. I usually listen to this one.\n\nSOUNDS OF THE INNER CITY has better sound quality, but Teddy Charles vibraphone solos are all edited out. Also, the twelve minute suite TAKE THREE PART JAZZ and EMBRACEABLE YOU, neither of which contain any playing by the two Bookers, are left out. In their place is a track called WITCH FIRE, with an entirely different lineup, taken from an album which I believe was originally relased by Warwick Records called &quot;The Soul Of Jazz Percussion&quot;.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nBooker Little &amp; Teddy Charles Group - LIVE - THE COMPLETE CONCERT\n\n1.
