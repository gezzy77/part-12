Tested on Snow Leopard (10.6). \n\nRemember though, this is the FREE version of ArmA 2, not the paid version... :3. \n\nThis is the 1.0.1 Version, which fixes the no startup error. So do NOT download the old version! Ah well, i might have the old version deleted anyways so, uhm, yeah, but download this version!  \n\nYes, i did take the base port from Dan but then modify it a bit :). So i'm still gonna give Dan some credit! :D. Also, Dan had nothing to do with this actual torrent, only me, XxLAZERZWillxX :3. \n\nI also made the icon etc. :). \n\nAnd by the way, decided to add a little Wallpaper if you want one ;). \n\nRemember though! This is 1.0, and has lotsa, lotsa lag, and other issuesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nMy comment on Dan's port if you wanna know about the performance etc.: \n\n&quot;Works with the free version now after clearing out ALL the other DLC files etc.!\n\nPlaying the game on these settings:\n\nTextures: Normal\n\nAF: Very High\n\nAA: Are you kidding me? Of course not! Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaags...\n\nTerrain Detail: Very Low\n\nObject Detail: Very Low\n\nShadows: Disabled\n\nPost Processing Effects: Very High\n\nAnd i think those are all the settings? :3.\n\nAnd all of this is APPARENTLY Very High? I guess because of the amounts of &quot;Very High&quot;'s i put in there .Ã‚Â Ã‚Â \n\nBut, the resolution, oh god...\n\nI have to play on 640x480, to get &quot;better than horrible&quot; FPS! \n\nBut ah well, my specs suck after all so, i did expect that.\n\nHave a few issues though that you did mention, like weird Shadows etc. But i also have a weird issue sometimes when changing resolutions, that everything just all of a sudden is zoomed in? \n\nOh yeah, right, my specs... :3.\n\nMy System Specs:\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.6.8\n- CPU: 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\n- RAM: 2 GB\n- Video:Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  Nvidia GeForce 9400 256 MBÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\nGet about 5-15 FPS :l. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨But nevertheless, you did something others couldn't achieve... Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨You ported ArmA 2... Great work bro .&quot; \n\nIf you wanna see more of me and/or my ports, then check out these links below: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://portingteam.com/user/21567-xxlazerzwillxx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://portingteam.com/user/21567-xxlazerzwillxx/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamertag=xxlazerzwillxx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamertag=xxlazerzwillxx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd my Skype is: Williamnumpru \n\nSo, hope you enjoy ArmA 2 Free! :D.
