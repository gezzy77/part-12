It marked Marvel's second attempt at entering the comics-magazine field dominated by Warren Publishing (Creepy, Eerie, Vampirella), following the two-issue superhero entry The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1968.  Starring in the first issue were Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery pulp-fiction character Conan the Barbarian, adapted by writer Roy Thomas and artist Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith); the futuristic, Amazon-like Femizons, by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist John Romita; the swamp creature Man-Thing, plotted by Lee and Thomas, scripted by Gerry Conway and drawn by Gray Morrow; the African-American inner-city defender Joshua, in the feature &quot;Black Brother&quot; by Dennis O'Neil (under the pseudonym Sergius O'Shaughnessy) and penciler Gene Colan; and, after Conan had been spun off into his own Savage Sword of Conan, the jungle lord Ka-Zar, by Lee and artist John Buscema.\n\nWhen the magazine eventually began publishing again years later in the wake of a Conan-inspired sword-and-sorcery trend in comics, it starred the likes of Conan, fellow Robert E. Howard hero Kull of Atlantis and John Jakes' barbarian creation, Brak. As of issue #6, the magazine cover-featured Ka-Zar.\n\nThe series featured painted covers by notable comics artists incouding John Buscema (#1-2), Pablo Marcos &amp; John Romita (#3), Neal Adams (#4-6), Boris Vallejo (#7, #10), and Michael Kaluta (#9). A 1975 annual, consisting entirely of reprints, mostly from Ka-Zar's four-color line series, sported a new cover by Ken Barr.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e3dcb28c41c5158c2a3dc969be7eca13ad5ee18","amp;dn":"Savage+Tales+v1+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e3dcb28c41c5158c2a3dc969be7eca13ad5ee18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,61,203,40,196,28,81,88,194,163,220,150,155,231,236,161,58,213,238,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
