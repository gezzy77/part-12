Pat Solatano has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother and father after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet - and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f10cd4c6cdcc00c98a23c247d992bfe956ec82","amp;dn":"Silver.Linings.Playbook.2012.DVDScr.XviD-MAGNAT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f10cd4c6cdcc00c98a23c247d992bfe956ec82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,241,12,212,198,205,204,0,201,138,35,194,71,217,146,191,233,86,236,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
