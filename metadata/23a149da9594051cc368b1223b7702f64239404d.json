In every event you have the option to ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£play it your wayÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad theyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll be down on you like several tons of cold pork!\n\nFEATURES\n- 28 dangerously deranged Opponents\n- 11 wildly exhilarating Environments\n- Career Mode featuring 36 satisfyingly violent Levels\n- Race and Wreck opponents to unlock 30 playable cars!\n- Multiple control methods: digital, analogue (mix ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿nÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ match), tilt\n- Edit your control layout in game to your preferences\n- Comprehensive Action Replay System\n- Environment maps and other special effects\n- Enhanced pre-lit environments\n- Buckets of gibs\n- Tons of laughs\n\nCarmageddon requires Android 2.3.4 or later.\n\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITION FOR THE ORIGINAL GAME\nCarmageddon won the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Game of the YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ trophy in the 1997 PC Zone Reader awards.
