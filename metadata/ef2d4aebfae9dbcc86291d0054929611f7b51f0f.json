Got it.\nNot exactly the Springer version, its the university copy but the content is same, only the cover and bookmarks are missing...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMichele Audin, &quot;Geometry&quot;\nSp,,ger | 2003 | ISBN: 3540434984 | 357 pages | PDF | 2,2 MB\n\nGeometry, this very ancient field of study of mathematics, frequently remains too little familiar to students. MichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le Audin, professor at the university of Strasbourg has written a book allowing them to remedy this situation and, and starting from linear algebra extend their knowledge of affine, euclidian and projective geometry, conic and quadric sections, curves and surfaces. It includes many nice theorems like the nine-point circle, Feuerbach's theorem, and so on. Everything is presented clearly and rigourously. Each property is proved, examples and exercises illustrate the course content perfectly. Precise hints for each exercise are provided at the end of the book. This very comprehensive text is addressed to students at upper undergraduate and Master's level to discover geometry and deepen their knowledge and understanding.
