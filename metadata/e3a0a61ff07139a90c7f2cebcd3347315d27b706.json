Talese (April 13, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385526423\nASIN: B007K4OTEW\nFormat: EPUB\n\n\n\nThe gripping international bestseller that fuses an ingenious detective tale with stunning, cinematic storytellingÃ¢â‚¬â€and a provocative riff on quantum physicsÃ¢â‚¬â€from GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost young literary talent.\n\nA child is kidnapped but does not know it. One man dies, two physicists fight, and a senior constable falls in love. In the end, everything is different . . . yet exactly the same.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Prologue \n\nA rising star who has garnered some of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important literary prizes, Juli Zeh has established herself as the new master of the philosophical thriller. With In Free Fall, she now takes us on a fast-paced ride through deadly rivalry and loveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infinite configurations. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of Germany and Switzerland, two physicists begin a dangerous dance of distrust. Friends since their university days, when they were aspiring Nobel Prize candidates, they now interact in an atmosphere of tension, stoked by OskarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belief that Sebastian fell into mediocrity by having a family. When SebastianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, Liam, is apparently kidnapped, their fragile friendship is further tested. Entrusted with uncovering the truth, Detective Superintendent Schilf discerns a web of blackmail, while at the same time the reality of his personal life falls into doubt. Unfolding in a series of razor-sharp scenes, In Free Fall is a riveting novel of ideas from a major new literary voice. With the recent success of works in translation, such as Stieg LarssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire, Zeh is poised to take off.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a0a61ff07139a90c7f2cebcd3347315d27b706","amp;dn":"In+Free+Fall+-+A+Novel+-+Juli+Zeh+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a0a61ff07139a90c7f2cebcd3347315d27b706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,160,166,31,240,113,57,169,12,127,44,235,205,51,71,49,93,39,183,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
