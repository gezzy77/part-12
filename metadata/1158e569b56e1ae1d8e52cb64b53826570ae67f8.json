Their brave, imaginative story has gone untold - until now. In The Age of Atheists, acclaimed historian Peter Watson offers a sweeping narrative of the secular philosophers and poets, psychologists and scientists, painters and playwrights, novelists and even choreographers who have forged a thrilling, bold path in the absence of religious belief.\n\nSynthesizing nearly a century and a half of recent history, The Age of Atheists is a stunning, magisterial celebration of life without recourse to the supernatural. From Paul ValÃƒÂ©ry and George Santayana to Richard Rorty and Ronald Dworkin, from Georges-Pierre Seurat and Constantin BrÃƒÂ¢ncuÃ…Å¸i to Jackson Pollock and Robert Rauschenberg, from AndrÃƒÂ© Gide to Philip Roth, from Rudolf Laban to Merce Cunningham, from Henrik Ibsen to Samuel Beckett, from Wallace Stevens and Rainer Maria Rilke to Elizabeth Bishop and CzesÃ…â€šaw MiÃ…â€šosz, from Sigmund Freud and Benjamin Spock to E. O. Wilson and Sam Harris, The Age of Atheists brilliantly explores how atheism has evolved, deepened and matured, and gained unprecedented resonance and popularity as it has sought to replace an unknowable god in the afterlife with the voluptuous detail and warmth of this life, to be found in art, philosophy and science, all woven into a rational, secular morality.\n\nFrom Nietzsche and his nihilism to Dawkins and Dennett, Nagel and Habermas, WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stimuÃ‚Â­lating intellectual narrative explores the revolutionary ideas and big questions provoked by these great minds and movements. A sparkling and ultimately triumÃ‚Â­phant history, The Age of Atheists is the first full story of our efforts to live without God.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Philosophy | History ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1158e569b56e1ae1d8e52cb64b53826570ae67f8","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Atheists+by+Peter+Watson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1158e569b56e1ae1d8e52cb64b53826570ae67f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,88,229,105,181,110,26,225,216,229,44,182,75,83,130,101,112,174,103,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
