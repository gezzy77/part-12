This is the most muscular he's ever been in any of his movies...right off a cycle of Anadrol-50 I tell you.  I can't believe his liver works still.\n\nI looked long and hard for this version of the DVD.  The version most people have seen, has Arnold Schwarzenegger DUBBED, even though he is speaking English in the movie.  THIS VERSION, is his NATURAL VOICE...hahaha.\n\nThis is also the movie that the Jerky Boys used for inspiration for their character SOL ROSENBERG...the annoying little jewish man...you'll notice him instantly...look and sound familiar?  Yeah, no shit, right off of the Jerky Boys CD.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nThe divine Hercules is bored by his life on mount Olympus and asks father Zeus for a vacation on Earth. His request is denied, but by an accident with one of Zeus' lightning bolts he's thrown into New York. His inexperience with civilization and his arrogance lead into problems - until a college professor's daughter helps him to acclimatize. He starts to like living on earth and wants to stay for longer, even when father Zeus sends Nemesis to punish him.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.0.2\nBitrate: 916 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x480 = 1.33:1 = 4:3\nAudio: English, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 01:32:41\nFPS: 23.976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac89dcf6b5c1a6de44662306d0676fac56a27932","amp;dn":"Hercules+In+New+York+%28xvid102-sickboy88%29+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac89dcf6b5c1a6de44662306d0676fac56a27932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,137,220,246,181,193,166,222,68,102,35,6,208,103,111,172,86,162,121,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
