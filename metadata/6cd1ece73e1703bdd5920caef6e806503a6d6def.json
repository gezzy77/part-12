Bethel, in Sullivan County, is 43 miles \n(69 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock, New York, in adjoining Ulster County.\n\nDuring the sometimes rainy weekend, thirty-two acts performed outdoors in front of 500,000 concert-goers.\nIt is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history. Rolling Stone called it one of the 50 \nMoments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll.\n\nThe event was captured in the 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying soundtrack album, and \nJoni Mitchell's song &quot;Woodstock&quot; which commemorated the event and became a major hit for \nCrosby, Stills, Nash n Young.\n\n\n\n\n   1 - John Sebastian / I Had a Dream                           [02:54]\n   2 - Canned Heat / Going Up the Country                       [03:34]\n   3 - Stage Announcements                                      [02:17]\n   4 - Richie Havens / Freedom                                  [05:26]\n   5 - Country Joe and the Fish / Rock &amp; Soul Music             [02:09]\n   6 - Arlo Guthrie / Coming into Los Angeles                   [02:45]\n   7 - Sha-Na-Na / At the Hop                                   [02:03]\n   8 - Country Joe MacDonald / I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag[03:55]\n   9 - Joan Baez / Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man                 [02:46]\n  10 - Joan Baez / Joe Hill                                     [03:15]\n  11 - Stage Announcements                                      [02:03]\n  12 - Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash / Suite: Judy Blue Eyes            [08:49]\n  13 - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young / Sea of Madness            [04:37]\n  14 - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young / Wooden Ships              [05:57]\n  15 - The Who / We're Not Gonna Take It                        [05:05]\n  16 - Stage Announcements                                      [01:28]\n  17 - Joe Cocker / With a Little Help from My Friends          [08:31]\n  18 - Rainstorm Chants                                         [01:52]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:09:33\nTotal Size...........: 347.83 MB\n\n\n   1 - Rain Chant                                        [02:47]\n   2 - Santana / Soul Sacrifice                          [08:30]\n   3 - Stage Announcements                               [02:28]\n   4 - Ten Years After / I'm Going Home                  [09:49]\n   5 - Jefferson Airplane / Volunteers                   [03:01]\n   6 - Max Yasgur                                        [00:43]\n   7 - Sly &amp; the Family Stone / Dance to the Music       [02:23]\n   8 - Sly &amp; the Family Stone / Music Lover              [07:12]\n   9 - Sly &amp; the Family Stone / I Want to Take You Higher[04:27]\n  10 - John Sebastian / Rainbows All Over Your Blues     [03:57]\n  11 - Butterfield Blues Band / Love March               [10:19]\n  12 - Jimi Hendrix / Star Spangled Banner - Purple Solo [13:47]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:09:27\nTotal Size...........: 356.47 MB\n\n\n   1 - Jimi Hendrix / Jam Back at the House                  [06:56]\n   2 - Jimi Hendrix / Izabella                               [05:36]\n   3 - Jimi Hendrix / Get My Heart Back Together             [08:22]\n   4 - Jefferson Airplane / Saturday Afternoon/Won't You Try [05:12]\n   5 - Jefferson Airplane / Eskimo Blue Day                  [06:38]\n   6 - Butterfield Blues Band / Everything's Gonna Be Alright[09:00]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 41:47\nTotal Size...........: 222.77 MB\n\n\n   1 - Joan Baez / Sweet Sir Galahad                         [03:57]\n   2 - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young / Guinnevere             [05:20]\n   3 - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young / 4 + 20                 [02:20]\n   4 - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young / Marrakesh Express      [02:32]\n   5 - Melanie / My Beautiful People                         [04:06]\n   6 - Melanie / Birthday Of The Sun                         [03:37]\n   7 - Mountain / Blood Of The Sun                           [03:33]\n   8 - Mountain / Theme For An Imaginary Western             [05:01]\n   9 - Canned Heat / Woodstock Boogie                        [13:48]\n  10 - Audience During Sunday Rainstorm / Let The Sunshine In[00:58]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 45:14\nTotal Size...........: 227.07 MB\n\n\nartwork included .JPEG format\n\n\nThanks to the original Riper / Poster\n\n\nEAC [Secure mode] | Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit | VorbisComment | Lossless Audio Codec | [avg. compression: variable]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd1ece73e1703bdd5920caef6e806503a6d6def","amp;dn":"Woodstock+One+and+Two+1970-71+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29+MFSL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd1ece73e1703bdd5920caef6e806503a6d6def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,209,236,231,62,23,3,189,213,146,12,174,246,232,6,80,58,109,109,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
