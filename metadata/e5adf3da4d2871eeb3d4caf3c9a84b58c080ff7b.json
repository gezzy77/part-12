It was released as a 3-CD\n\nSingles Collection: The London Years was released by former manager Allen Klein's ABKCO Records (who usurped control of the band's Decca/London material in 1970) after the band's departure from Decca and Klein.\n\nThe set is a triple album of every Rolling Stones singleÃ¢â‚¬â€and their B-SidesÃ¢â‚¬â€mostly in their original mono mixes (at least as of the 2002 reissue), in both the UK and US encompassing their entire era with Decca Records in the United Kingdom and London Records in the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€hence the album's title.\n\nThe original collection was produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, and digitally compiled and prepared under his supervision by P. D. Rain and Jody Klein.\n\nWith a range from 1963 to 1971, the set begins with their very first UK single, Chuck Berry's &quot;Come On&quot;, and runs to Sticky Fingers' &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (which Allen Klein shares release rights with The Rolling Stones).\n\nThe only omissions are four B-sides from 1970 and 1971. &quot;Bitch&quot; and &quot;Let It Rock&quot; (released in the UK on the &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; single) and &quot;Sway&quot; (B-side to &quot;Wild Horses&quot;). Allen Klein did not have release rights to this material when this compilation was released. Also not included was &quot;Natural Magic&quot;, a Ry Cooder instrumental, released as the B-side to the 1970 Mick Jagger single &quot;Memo from Turner&quot;. These are available on the box set Singles 1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971 except &quot;Let It Rock&quot; which is available on the box set Singles 1971Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006 and the Rarities 1971Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003 album.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;Come On&quot; (Chuck Berry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:48\n    &quot;I Want to Be Loved&quot; (Willie Dixon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:52\n    &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; (John Lennon/Paul McCartney) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:43\n    &quot;Stoned&quot; (Nanker Phelge) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:09\n    &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; (Charles Hardin/Norman Petty) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:47\n    &quot;Little by Little&quot; (Nanker Phelge/Phil Spector) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n    &quot;It's All Over Now&quot; (Bobby Womack/Shirley Jean Womack) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:27\n    &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:31\n    &quot;Tell Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n    &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; (Willie Dixon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:17\n    &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot; (Norman Meade) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59\n    &quot;Congratulations&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:28\n    &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; (Willie Dixon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n    &quot;Off the Hook&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34\n    &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n    &quot;What a Shame&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n    &quot;The Last Time&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n    &quot;Play With Fire&quot; (Nanker Phelge) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:14\n    &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:43\n    &quot;The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man&quot; (Nanker Phelge) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n    &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:54\n    &quot;I'm Free&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:24\n    &quot;The Singer Not the Song&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:22\n    &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards/Andrew Loog Oldham) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:07\n    &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n    &quot;Sad Day&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Paint It, Black&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n    &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n    &quot;Long Long While&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:45\n    &quot;Lady Jane&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n    &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34\n    &quot;Who's Driving Your Plane?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n    &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:26\n    &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n    &quot;We Love You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:36\n    &quot;Dandelion&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n    &quot;She's a Rainbow&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n    &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n    &quot;In Another Land&quot; (Bill Wyman) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53\n    &quot;The Lantern&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26\n    &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n    &quot;Child of the Moon&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n\nDisc 3\n\n    &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n    &quot;No Expectations&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n    &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n    &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:49\n    &quot;Memo from Turner&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:06\n        Released as a Mick Jagger solo single in November 1970\n    &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Wild Horses&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:42\n    &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot; (Stevie Wonder/Paul Riser/Don Hunter/Lula Hardaway) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Try a Little Harder&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:17\n    &quot;Out of Time&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n    &quot;Jiving Sister Fanny&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:17\n\nBONUS\n\n    &quot;Bitch&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n    &quot;Let It Rock&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n    &quot;Sway&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n    &quot;Natural Magic&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:39\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5adf3da4d2871eeb3d4caf3c9a84b58c080ff7b","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Singles+Collection%3A+The+London+Years+%5B320k+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5adf3da4d2871eeb3d4caf3c9a84b58c080ff7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,173,243,218,77,40,113,238,179,212,202,243,201,168,75,88,192,128,255,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
