Fittingly for veterans of the arena rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s, FoghatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blues are heavily steeped in the British InvasionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of the blues -- theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re long on amplification and extended jams, as should be expected for a band who is an outgrowth of Savoy Brown -- but their roots dig deeper, as evidenced by two good cuts with Eddie Kirkland at the end of the record. Foghat donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reinvent these songs, but they do play with a considerable amount of energy and a precision that only a veteran touring band could have, making this a nice little surprise for hardcore fans. ~Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\n1.
