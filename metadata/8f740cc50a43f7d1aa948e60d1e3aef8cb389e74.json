Trifonov\nMir Publishers | 1982 | English | PDF | 264 pages | 16.2 mb\nscanned to PDF by me\nThis is another of my old Mir books that I had bought 25 years back!\nAll chemical compounds that constitute living and inorganic matter are diverse combinations of eighty-odd elements. The remaining known elements are practically not found in nature. Scientists created them artificially by means of nuclear reactions. More new elements can be obtained in this manner and we do not know how many of them. But it is quite clear that the chemical alphabet is not complete yet.\nThis book describes how the alphabet of chemistry has been designed and how the inquisitive mind of the researchers discovered new chemical elements, one after another.\n\nCONYENTS\nNotice to the reader 9 \nIntroduction 11\nPart One - Elements Discovered in Nature\nChapter 1 Elements Known in Antiquity\nChapter 2 Elements Discovered in the Middle Ages \nChapter 3 Elements of Air and Water.\nChapter 4 Elements Discovered by Chemical Analysis\nChapter 5 Elements Discovered by the Electrochemical Method\nChapter 6 Elements Discovered by the Spectroscopic Method\nChapter 7 Rare Earths\nChapter 8 Helium and Other Inert Gases\nChapter 9 Elements Predicted from the Periodic System\nChapter 10 Two Stable Elements Which Were the Last to Be Discovered\nChapter 11 Radioactive Elements\nPart Two - Synthesized Elements\nChapter 12 Discoveries of Synthesized Elements Within the Old Boundaries of the Periodic System\nChapter 13 Transuranium Elements\nConclusion 252\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f740cc50a43f7d1aa948e60d1e3aef8cb389e74","amp;dn":"Chemical+Elements+-+How+They+Were+Discovered+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f740cc50a43f7d1aa948e60d1e3aef8cb389e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,116,12,197,10,67,247,209,170,148,142,96,209,227,174,248,203,56,158,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
