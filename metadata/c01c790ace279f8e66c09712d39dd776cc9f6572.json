Their debut album is My Wish is Your Command and if you want to hear female vocals that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t competing for a role on phantom of the Opera or mimicing Angela GossowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gutteral snarl, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to hear this girl sing Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ or screech, or shout, or gurgle, or whatever the hell it is sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Chris Slade could be in any band, but he joined MIWA because he likes SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar playing and MiwaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful vocals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MIWAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bio proudly states. Smart move, Chris.\n\nThe first time I listened to this album, I was impressed. The second time, I fucking loved it.\n\nThis style of heavy metal requires a strong lead vocal to pull it off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got excellent riffage like this release Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, while Miwa lacks the range of other hard rock/heavy metal vocalists, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely not short of power or charisma. MiwaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinct style often reminds me of the punk rock group Civet, especially on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Playing with FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nYou already know that if Chris Slade is hanging around, the drums are going to be awesome. The man knows how to augment a song in just the right places to propel it forward or bring it back. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the riffs and solos lift this album from amongst its peers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I am a guitar girl, first and foremost, and My Wish is Your Command will restore your faith in classic, guitar driven hard rock. The songs work Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they flow with a natural ease that can only come from four talented musicians who just click. This is the kind of music that compels you to jump around, pump your arms, and make a jackass of yourself.\n\nÃÂ¡ategory:\tMusic\nYear:\t2011\nStyle:\tHeavy Metal\nAdditional:\tHard Rock\nCountry:\tUSA\nFormat:\t320 mp3\nSize:\t98.18 MB\n\n\t\nAdded:\t2015-04-05 16:55:36\nFiles:\t11\n\nDescription:\t\nLength: 00:42:49\n\nTracks\n\n\n01.
