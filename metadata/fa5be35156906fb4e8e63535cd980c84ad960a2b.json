Due to the \nchanges in storyline and engine, it's required to start a new game after you \ninstalled this update.\nYour previous saves will not work. This patch is cumulative, so you will not \nneed to install the previous (1.30013) patch at all.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnpack the zip somewhere, and run the setup. It will wipe the previous patch \ncontent, as well as gamedata, and bins directory from the game. So if you had \nmodded files, make sure you back them up before you run the patch.\n\nBeware, mods for 1st patch will not work with this 2nd patch until mod makers \nmake them compatible. We can not give support in this case.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Changes Log\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFixes:\n- fixed vibrating (constant open and close) doors on Great Metal Factory level\n- fixed inaccessible &quot;ashes to ashes&quot;
