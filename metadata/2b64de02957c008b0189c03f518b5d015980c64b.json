This class continues right where we left off in Maya 101 and is the ideal next step for those who either participated in 101, or already possess a basic understanding of Maya. This class will demonstrate the creation of many different projects from the ground up - but with a focus on camera systems, rigid bodies, soft bodies, nCloth, particles and fluids.\n\nThe Maya Dynamics class will have a single, 2 hour, live session per week for 6 weeks. For students who can't attend live, each session will be recorded and made available for streaming on 3D Buzz.\n\nThose who can make it to the live sessions, however, will awarded a certification of completion. The signed, digital, certificate will be provided for all students who attend at least 50% of the live sessions and turn in each homework assignment by the deadline.\n\n\nWeek 1 - Cameras\n\nCreate cinematic cameras\nCreate hand held cameras\nCamera on a path\nTurntables\nConstrain your camera\nHomework\n________________________________\n\nWeek 2 - Rigid Body\n\nCover basics\nCoin spin\nDominoes\nDMM or other\nCrack script\nFracture tool\nHomework\n_______________________________\n\nWeek 3 - Soft bodies and nCloth\n\nFootprints in snow\nCollisions\nnCloth setup\nConstrain nCloth\nTear nCloth\nHomework\n_______________________________\n\nWeek 4 - nCloth\n\nnCloth for fluid\nProblems nCloth can solve\nSlag scene talk through\nHomework\n________________________________\n\nWeek 5 - Particles\n\nParticles\nEmit on collide\nSprites\nSoftware renderer\nPixie dust\nHomework\n________________________________\n\nWeek 6 - Fluids\n\nFire\nWater\nSoup plugin for Maya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b64de02957c008b0189c03f518b5d015980c64b","amp;dn":"Maya+Dynamics+Tutorials+-+3D+Buzz+-+6-Lesson+Training+Class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b64de02957c008b0189c03f518b5d015980c64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,100,222,2,149,124,0,139,1,137,192,63,81,139,93,1,89,128,198,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
