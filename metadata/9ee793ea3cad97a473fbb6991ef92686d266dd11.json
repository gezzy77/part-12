Of that group, only Charlie Rouse remains on tenor sax Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Rouse is more than enough to make things great, and the interplay between his tenor and Monk's piano is completely sublime Ã¢â‚¬â€œ full of angular movements, underscored with plenty of soul Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and given support from Nate Hygelund on bass and either Paris Wright or Philly Joe Jones on drums. There's a rough edge to the music that's really great Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that sharper, more sinister vibe that Monk could have in a live setting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include &quot;Light Blue&quot;, &quot;Bright Mississippi&quot;, &quot;I Mean You&quot;, &quot;Ruby My Dear&quot;, &quot;I Love You Sweetheart Of All My Dreams&quot;, &quot;Crepuscule With Nellie&quot;, and &quot;Nutty&quot;. \n\nSpecial package comes with a bonus DVD of the performance!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - I Mean You\n02 - Ruby My Dear\n03 - Straight, No Chaser\n04 - Bright Mississippi\n05 - Light Blue\n06 - Epistrophy\n07 - Don't Blame Me\n08 - I Love You Sweetheart Of All My Dreams\n09 - Crepuscule With Nellie\n10 - Bright Mississippi (Reprise)\n11 - Nutty\n12 - Blue Monk\n\n*2013 Blue Note / Laser Swing Pro. | B001882000\n\nPersonnel:\nThelonious Monk - piano\nCharlie Rouse - tenor saxophone\nNate Hygelund - bass\nParis Wright - drums\nwith special guest\nPhilly Joe Jones - drums\n\n\n\nThelonious Monk - Paris 1969 [DVD] (2013): \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9810287/Thelonious_Monk_-_Paris_1969_[DVD]_(2013)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9810287/Thelonious_Monk_-_Paris_1969_[DVD]_(2013)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
