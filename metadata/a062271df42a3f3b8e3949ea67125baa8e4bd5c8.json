Which should be all the description needed, right?!\n\nAs to specs, these are last year's Digital Lo-Res versions by Empire. The 6 TPBs are the original releases, except in one case in which I apparently repacked the archive. I don't actually recall the reason now, but as there are no additional bookends from a different source, my guess is that a missing page or page ordering flaw was fixed. The 11 shorts are the yield from disassembling the remaining TPB release, with cover and pinup artwork suitably redistributed.\n\nTherefore, if you already have any or all of the &quot;Frank Miller's Sin City v1-7 (2010) (Digital) (Empire)&quot; releases from blackcanary's upload or the Hitlists or wherever, you can rename those and incorporate them into the download beforehand.\n\nTarget chronological naming scheme:\n\nv1 - &quot;1991-04 - Sin City (aka ''The Hard Goodbye'') (Digital-1280) (Empire).cbr&quot;\nv2 - &quot;1993-11 - A Dame to Kill For (Digital-1280) (Empire).cbr&quot;\nv3 - &quot;1994-11 - The Big Fat Kill (Digital-1280) (Son of Ultron-Empire).cbr&quot;\nv4 - &quot;1996-02 - That Yellow Bastard (Digital-1280) (Son of Ultron-Empire).cbr&quot;\nv5 - &quot;1997-10 - Family Values (Digital-1280) (Son of Ultron-Empire).cbr&quot;\nv6 -  N/A, that's the anthology volume\nv7 - &quot;1999-07 - Hell and Back (Digital-1280) (Son of Ultron-Empire).cbr&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a062271df42a3f3b8e3949ea67125baa8e4bd5c8","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Sin+City+%28Dark+Horse%7C1991-99%7CDigital-1280%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a062271df42a3f3b8e3949ea67125baa8e4bd5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,98,39,29,244,42,63,59,142,57,73,234,103,18,91,170,142,75,213,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
