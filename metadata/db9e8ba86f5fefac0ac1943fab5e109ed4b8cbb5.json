Their current line-up includes pianist and vocalist Andrew McMahon, guitarist Josh Partington, bassist Kevin Page and drummer Brian Ireland.\n\nFollowing their formation, Something Corporate recorded demos that were eventually released as an independent, minor studio album entitled Ready... Break. Soon after, they were signed to MCA Records but were released under the Drive-Thru Records banner for their debut EP Audioboxer. Their first single, &quot;If You C Jordan&quot;, was their most successful, peaking at number 29 on the Alternative Songs chart. Their first album released through the major label was Leaving Through the Window (2002) which premiered at Number 1/Hot Shot Debut on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart on June 8, 2002 and eventually peaked at number 101 on the Billboard 200.\n\nSomething Corporate went on hiatus in 2004 and no longer had any recording contracts with their record labels. During the hiatus, McMahon found success in his side-project Jack's Mannequin. Something Corporate briefly reunited in October 2006 (at a Jack's Mannequin show) to play a short set. In December 2009, Something Corporate officially announced their reunion to tour in 2010 and released a greatest hits album. McMahon announced during an August 3, 2010 visit to Milwaukee that the band had collectively sold over 1 million total records in the band's ten years of existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayed In Space 2010\n\n\nPlayed in Space: The Best of Something Corporate is a compilation album by Something Corporate released April 27, 2010.[2] It is made up of two discs: one, a greatest hits album, and the other with previously unreleased tracks and newly mixed songs. An exclusive iTunes edition contains the bonus track &quot;Letters to Noelle&quot;.[3] The title &quot;Played in Space&quot; is a reference to the fact that NASA control on Earth played the song &quot;The Astronaut&quot; as a morning &quot;wake-up call&quot; to space shuttle astronauts in 2006.[4] The compilation debuted at 155 on the Billboard 200.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Space&quot; \n2.\t&quot;I Woke Up In A Car&quot; \n3.\t&quot;She Paints Me Blue&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Hurricane&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Me and the Moon&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Fall&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Ruthless&quot; \n8.\t&quot;I Want To Save You&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Cavanaugh Park&quot; \n10.\t&quot;If You C Jordan&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Down&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Walking By&quot; \n14.\t&quot;The Astronaut&quot; \n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Konstantine&quot; \tAndrew McMahon\t9:37\n2.\t&quot;Watch The Sky (Previously Unreleased)&quot; \tAndrew McMahon\t2:56\n3.\t&quot;Forget December (New Exclusive Mix)&quot; \tJosh Partington\t3:12\n4.\t&quot;I Woke Up In A Car (Adam Young Mix)&quot; \nAndrew McMahon\t4:08\n5.\t&quot;Wait (New Recording)&quot; \t\t\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9e8ba86f5fefac0ac1943fab5e109ed4b8cbb5","amp;dn":"Something+Corporate+-+Greatest+Hits+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9e8ba86f5fefac0ac1943fab5e109ed4b8cbb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,158,139,168,111,95,239,172,10,193,148,63,171,94,16,158,212,184,203,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
