But no matter how adventurous we might be in our personal lives, most of us are wary of allowing risk into our careers. With an economy in constant flux and a job market in which uncertainty is the only constant, stepping outside oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfort zone can feel dangerous. But as the findings of this eye-opening and urgent book attest, the avoidance of risk might pose the greatest danger of all to our career prospects.\n\nIn Risk/Reward, trend-spotter and career guru Anne Kreamer makes the compelling case that embracing risk is essential to managing a twenty-first-century career. Risk-taking isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just for entrepreneurs, nor does it require working on a figurative tightrope. Rather, Kreamer says, conscious, consistent, and modest risk-taking can help us become more able to recognize opportunity when it appears, and more likely to seize the chance to make the right change at the right moment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0defcc309e844c01786f8a9665bcb0d4a3818022","amp;dn":"Risk%2FReward%3A+Why+Intelligent+Leaps+and+Daring+Choices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0defcc309e844c01786f8a9665bcb0d4a3818022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,239,204,48,158,132,76,1,120,111,138,150,101,188,176,212,163,129,128,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
