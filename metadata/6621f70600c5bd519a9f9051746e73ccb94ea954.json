They also go over how Trans Pacific routes operate, where suitable diversion airports are located, the flight bag that Air Canada equips its 777 with, the Date Line and much more. As a bonus the program continues with a Trans Atlantic flight from Toronto to Frankfurt.\n\nEnjoy and if someone has one of the Iberia movies, put them on here and I'll follow this up with the 772LR!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6621f70600c5bd519a9f9051746e73ccb94ea954","amp;dn":"JustPlanes+%28WorldAirRoutes%29+Air+Canada+777-300ER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6621f70600c5bd519a9f9051746e73ccb94ea954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,33,247,6,0,197,189,81,154,159,144,81,116,110,115,204,185,78,169,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
