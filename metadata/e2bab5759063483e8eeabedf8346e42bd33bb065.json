Aside from the bug at installation that causes it to appear in Japanese, however there is a TXT along to help which I also copied and pasted here. No big deal thu, the game is in english and works.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game appears to be in Japanese when you install it, but once you start it, it&amp;#039;s in English. Just choose the topmost choise on the autorun menu to start the installer.\n-----------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2bab5759063483e8eeabedf8346e42bd33bb065","amp;dn":"Crescendo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2bab5759063483e8eeabedf8346e42bd33bb065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,186,181,117,144,99,72,62,142,234,190,223,131,70,228,43,211,59,176,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
