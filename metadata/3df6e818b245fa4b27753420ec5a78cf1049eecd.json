This is a superb collection. It's not just an outtakes/alternate takes/odds'n'sods set. It brilliantly catalogues Robert's history, compressing it into 5 short, absolutely essential CDs gorgeously packaged by Alfreda Benge and stacked inside a lovely plasticised blue box. After this, you really hardly need anything else.\r\n\r\nCDs 1-3 are uniformly excellent, documenting Robert's sophisticated pop period ('I'm A Believer'; 'Shipbuilding'), followed by some of his overtly political material. 'Pigsâ€¦ (In There)' is a short docu-drama of animal rights outrage, done without any hectoring or proselytising; just an innocently human, incredulous 'Pigs?â€¦ In THERE?' repeated over and over. Simple, unassuming, but deeply, deeply affecting. CD 4 presents the eerie, disoriented music of 'The Animals Film': thinly produced, solarized, insomniac, frazzled. There is real suffering here. After all this, though, it's Disc 5 that really drops your jaw. This is - wait for it - a set of techno remixes of some key tracks from 'Schleep'.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Schleep' is already the best progressive rock record of the last 20 years; but these tracks, ProTooled to perfection with dark ambient textures, dubscapes, and sophisticated beats, boost Wyatt the Artist straight into the stratosphere, as far as I am concerned. This CD reinvents the progressive rock genre, showing with absolute grace how current forms can reframe mature concerns for modern consumption. Robert would probably shrug and tell us it was just an experiment and anyway he didn't have much to do with it. How Robert Wyatt. Howâ€¦ refreshing. Buy this CD, because only Robert Wyatt (a genius who would look at his shoes if you said so) Can Do This.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCD1 - Bits\r\n01 - I'm A Believer\r\n02 - Memories\r\n03 - Yesterday Man\r\n04 - Sonia\r\n05 - Calyx\r\n\r\nCD2 - Pieces\r\n01 - Shipbuilding\r\n02 - Memories of You\r\n03 - Round Midnight\r\n04 - Pigsâ€¦ (In There)\r\n05 - Chairman Mao\r\n\r\nCD3 - Work In Progress\r\n01 - Yolanda\r\n02 - Te Recuerdo Amanda\r\n03 - Biko\r\n04 - Amber and the Amberines\r\n\r\nCD4 - Animals\r\n01 - The Animals' Film\r\n\r\nCD5 - Remixes\r\n01 - Was a Friend\r\n02 - Maryan\r\n03 - A Sunday In Madrid\r\n04 - Free Will and Testament\r\n\r\n*999 Hannibal / Rykodisc / Robert Wyatt | HNCD 1440 {5EPs Box Set Hannibal-Rykodisc}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Wyatt - The End Of An Ear (1970) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9418587/Robert_Wyatt_-_The_End_Of_An_Ear_%281970%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatching Mole (Robert Wyatt) - Matching Mole (1972) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n   \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9224698/Matching_Mole_(Robert_Wyatt)_-_Matching_Mole_(1972)__[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatching Mole - Matching Mole's Little Red Record (1972) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9425509/Matching_Mole_-_Matching_Mole_s_Little_Red_Record_%281972%29_%5BEAC-FL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df6e818b245fa4b27753420ec5a78cf1049eecd","amp;dn":"Robert+Wyatt+-+EPs+%281999%29+%5B5CD%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df6e818b245fa4b27753420ec5a78cf1049eecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,246,232,24,178,69,250,75,39,117,52,32,236,90,120,207,16,73,238,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
