Donald Byrd - Street Lady\n\n\nNot so much a fusion album as an attempt at mainstream soul and R&amp;B, Street Lady plays like the soundtrack to a forgotten blaxploitation film. Producer/arranger/composer Larry Mizell conceived Street Lady as a concept album to a spirited, independent prostitute, and while the hooker with a heart of gold concept is a little trite, the music uncannily evokes an urban landscape circa the early &amp;#039;70s. Borrowing heavily from Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, and Sly Stone, Donald Byrd and Mizell have created an album that is overflowing with wah-wah guitars, stuttering electric pianos, percolating percussion, soaring flutes, and charmingly anemic, tuneless vocals. It&amp;#039;s certainly not jazz, or even fusion, but it isn&amp;#039;t really funk or R&amp;B, either -- the rhythms aren&amp;#039;t elastic enough, and all of the six songs are simply jazzy vamps without clear hooks. But the appeal of Street Lady is how its polished neo-funk and pseudo-fusion sound uncannily like a jive movie or television soundtrack from the early &amp;#039;70s -- you can picture the Street Lady, decked out in polyester, cruising the streets surrounded by pimps with wide-brimmed hats and platform shoes. And while that may not be ideal for jazz purists, it&amp;#039;s perfect for kitsch and funk fanatics.\n\n\n01.

Donald Byrd ÃƒÂ¢?? Up With Donald Byrd\n\n\nThe Donald Byrd album is marred somewhat by background vocals, which were overdubbed later.After a couple of listens, you can easily ignore the vocals and concentrate on some very good performances, especially by Jimmy Heath.\n\n\n\n01.
