Rex were a British rock band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Marc Bolan. The band formed as Tyrannosaurus Rex, releasing four underground folk albums under the name. Tony Visconti (their producer for several albums) claimed in a documentary on the band that he had taken to using the abbreviated term &quot;T. Rex&quot; as a shorthand, something that initially irritated Bolan, who gradually came around to the idea and officially shortened the band's name to &quot;T. Rex&quot; at roughly the same time they started having big hits (shortly after going electric).\n\nIn the early to mid 1970s, the band reached huge success with fourteen top-20 UK glam rock hits: &quot;Jeepster&quot;, &quot;Get It On&quot;, &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold Easy Action&quot;, &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot;, &quot;Hot Love&quot;, &quot;Telegram Sam&quot;, &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;, &quot;Debora&quot;, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, &quot;The Groover&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot;, &quot;I Love To Boogie&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot;. During this period the band also released six UK top-30 albums, including Electric Warrior, which hit the top of the album charts. In 1977, Bolan was killed in a car accident, and the band broke up.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d3e3400e3dd77cbc796b95362c6a0bf5ba4259","amp;dn":"%5CT.+Rex++7+VINYLS+%2824-96%26amp%3B192%29%2B+1+SACD+1968-1974.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d3e3400e3dd77cbc796b95362c6a0bf5ba4259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,211,227,64,14,61,215,124,188,121,107,149,54,44,106,11,245,186,66,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
