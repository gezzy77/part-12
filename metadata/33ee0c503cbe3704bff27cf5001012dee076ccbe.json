Without this visibility \r\n\r\nit is difficult and time-consuming to determine exactly where the fault is. \r\n\r\nCharles makes it easy to see what is happening, so you can quickly diagnose and \r\n\r\nfix problems.\r\n\r\nCharles makes debugging quick, reliable and advanced; saving you time and \r\n\r\nfrustration!\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n\r\n    SSL Proxying â€“ view SSL requests and responses in plain text\r\n\r\n    Bandwidth Throttling to simulate slower Internet connections including latency\r\n\r\n    AJAX debugging â€“ view XML and JSON requests and responses as a tree or as text\r\n\r\n    AMF â€“ view the contents of Flash Remoting / Flex Remoting messages as a tree\r\n\r\n    Repeat requests to test back-end changes\r\n\r\n    Edit requests to test different inputs\r\n\r\n    Breakpoints to intercept and edit requests or responses\r\n\r\n    Validate recorded HTML, CSS and RSS/atom responses using the W3C validator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSSL Proxying\r\n\r\nCharles can act as a man-in-the-middle for HTTP/SSL communication, enabling you to \r\n\r\ndebug the content of your HTTPS sessions.\r\n\r\nBandwidth Throttling\r\n\r\nCharles simulates modem speeds by effectively throttling your bandwidth and \r\n\r\nintroducing latency, so that you can experience an entire website as a modem user \r\n\r\nmight (bandwidth simulator).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAJAX\r\n\r\nCharles is useful for XML development in web browsers, such as AJAX (Asynchronous \r\n\r\nJavascript and XML) and XMLHTTP, as it enables you to see the actual XML that is \r\n\r\nflowing between the client and the server. Charles natively supports JSON, JSON-RPC \r\n\r\nand SOAP; displaying each in a simplified tree format for easy viewing and debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlash\r\n\r\nCharles is great for Adobe Flash developers as you can view the contents of \r\n\r\nLoadVariables, LoadMovie and XML loads. Charles also has native support for Flash \r\n\r\nRemoting (AMF0 and AMF3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutoconfigure Browser &amp; System Proxy Settings\r\n\r\nCharles will autoconfigure your browser's proxy settings on the following browsers:\r\n\r\n    Windows system proxy settings (includes Internet Explorer and most other          applications)\r\n\r\n    Mac OS X system proxy settings (includes Safari and most other applications)\r\n\r\n    Mozilla Firefox (on all platforms)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ee0c503cbe3704bff27cf5001012dee076ccbe","amp;dn":"Charles+Web+Debugging+Proxy+4+Crack+x86.x64-FSOCIETY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ee0c503cbe3704bff27cf5001012dee076ccbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,238,12,80,60,190,55,4,191,242,124,245,0,16,18,222,224,118,204,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
