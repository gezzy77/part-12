The Trinity Y Sessions was recorded with a single microphone in Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity (hence the title), an engineering circumstance that has everything to do with the record's stark, spacious atmosphere. Bass and lightly brushed drums provide a soft, pulsating background, while gentle guitar embellishments weave around singer Margo's haunting vocal performances.\n\nWhile it is the record's many covers-including treatments of the Velvet Underground's &quot;Sweet Jane,&quot; Hank Williams' &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,&quot; and Patsy Cline's &quot;Walking After Midnight&quot;-that first catch a listener's attention, the originals also sparkle. &quot;Misguided Angel,&quot; in particular, received a good deal of airplay. The combination of gentle, smoky atmospherics and the somewhat unsettling distention of conventional country song structures make The Trinity Sessions an intriguing and worthwhile listen.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 Mining For Gold (1:34)\n2 Misguided Angel (4:58 )\n3 Blue Moon Revisited (Song For Elvis) (4:31)\n4 I Don't Get It (4:34)\n5 I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry (5:24)\n6 To Love Is To Bury (4:47)\n7 200 More Miles (5:29)\n8 Dreaming My Dreams With You (4:28 )\n9 Working On A Building (3:48 )\n10 Sweet Jane (3:41)\n11 Postcard Blues (3:28 )\n12 Walking After Midnight (5:54)\n\n\nRecorded live at The Church Of The Holy Trinity, Toronto, Canada on November 27, 1987.\n\n\nPersonnel: Margo Timmins (vocals); Kim Deschamps (guitar, steel guitar, dobro); John Timmins (guitar, background vocals); Michael Timmins (guitar); Jeff Bird (mandolin, fiddle, harmonica); Steve Shearer (harmonica); Jaro Czerwinec (accordion); Peter Timmins (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac65aa52af87f29db26662f0c9965a8c1f734e6","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+The+Trinity+Session%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac65aa52af87f29db26662f0c9965a8c1f734e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,198,90,165,42,248,127,41,219,38,102,47,12,153,101,168,193,247,52,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
