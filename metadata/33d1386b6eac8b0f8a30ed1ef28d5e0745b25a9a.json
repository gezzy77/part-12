They served as backup singers for Lou Rawls, Teddy Pendergrass, Aretha Franklin, and Le Pamplemousse. They worked with Diana Ross from 1975Ã¢â‚¬â€œ78 and were the backup singers on Linda Clifford's 1978 album If My Friends Could See Me Now.\n\nThe Jones Girls were an R&amp;B trio of sisters from Detroit, Michigan. They first recorded for GM Records in 1968, then recorded for Philadelphia International Records with Gamble &amp; Huff.\n\nFor those who love 70s and 80s music these &quot;GIRLS&quot; have got to be on your list of favs. The Jones Girls had such hits as YOU GONNA MAKE ME LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE,  WHO CAN I RUN TO (remade by Xscape and I think EnVogue), DANCE TURNED INTO ROMANCE, NIGHTS OVER EGYPT, I JUST LOVE THE MAN and GET AS MUCH LOVE AS YOU CAN. These are just a few of the hits these &quot;GIRLS&quot; have laid down in their time. I was and still am a fan of the Jones Girls and hope you are too.\n\nEnjoy this upload, please seed as long as possible so the music LIVES as long as possible.\n\nALBUMS IN THIS DISCOGRAPHY:\n\n1979 - The Jones Girls\n1980 - At Peace With A Woman\n1981 - Get As Much Love As You Can\n1983 - On Target\n1984 - Keep It Comin'\n1992 - Coming Back\n2004 - The Jones Girls 9Reissue)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d1386b6eac8b0f8a30ed1ef28d5e0745b25a9a","amp;dn":"THE+JONES+GIRLS+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d1386b6eac8b0f8a30ed1ef28d5e0745b25a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,209,56,107,110,172,139,15,138,48,237,30,242,141,94,7,69,178,90,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
