The media's relentless obsession with size may be a twenty-first century phenomenon, but as award-winning historian Louise Foxcroft shows, we have been struggling with what to eat, when and how much, ever since the Greeks and the Romans first pinched an inch. \nMeticulously researched, surprising and sometimes shocking, Calories and Corsets tells the epic story of our complicated relationship with food, the fashions and fads of body shape, and how cultural beliefs and social norms have changed over time. \nCombining research from medical journals, letters, articles and the dieting bestsellers we continue to devour (including one by an octogenarian Italian in the sixteenth century), Foxcroft reveals the extreme and often absurd lengths people will go to in order to achieve the perfect body, from eating carbolic soap to deliberately swallowing tapeworm.\nThis unique and witty history exposes the myths and anxieties that drive today's multi-billion pound dieting industry - and offers a welcome perspective on how we can be healthy and happy in our bodies.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/387a/69d94738.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/387a/69d94738.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c2de90dd3590bc937c387ac91efa9d67d8ca59","amp;dn":"Calories+and+Corsets-+A+history+of+dieting+over+two+thousand+yea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c2de90dd3590bc937c387ac91efa9d67d8ca59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,194,222,144,221,53,144,188,147,124,56,122,201,30,250,157,103,216,202,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
