The attack nearly killed the Reggae superstar, his wife, and his manager, and injured several others. Marley would go on to perform at the free concert on December 5, but he left the country the next day, not to return for two years.\r\n\r\nDeftly spanning decades and continents and peopled with a wide range of charactersâ€”assassins, journalists, drug dealers, and even ghostsâ€”A Brief History of Seven Killings is the fictional exploration of that dangerous and unstable time and its bloody aftermath, from the streets and slums of Kingston in the 1970s, to the crack wars in 1980s New York, to a radically altered Jamaica in the 1990s. Brilliantly inventive and stunningly ambitious, this novel is a revealing modern epic that will secure Marlon Jamesâ€™ place among the great literary talents of his generation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f425d96572dc815384c9d8ec9d03f41e45e87ae1","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+Seven+Killings%3A+A+Novel+by+Marlon+James","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f425d96572dc815384c9d8ec9d03f41e45e87ae1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,37,217,101,114,220,129,83,132,201,216,236,157,3,244,30,69,232,122,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
