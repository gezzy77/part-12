Created with an intoxicating mixture of acoustic and electronic, the music makes the now-classic space travel images more magical and memorable, introducing a dreamlike element to scenes of cold reality. *An Ending (Ascent)* is about as close to an actual tune as you*ll get, but, as with every track, a shining example of what ambient music reveals about itself--slowly and carefully. -- Paul Clark\n\n\nTrack Listings:\n\nSide 1:\n\n1.
