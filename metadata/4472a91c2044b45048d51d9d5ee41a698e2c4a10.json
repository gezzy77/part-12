Filled with the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark candor and compassion, Face the Nation shines a witty and nostalgic light on our nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s presidents, culture, foreign policy and domestic affairs. This is a one-of-a-kind anniversary gift from a man uniquely qualified to reflect on our changing country over the past 50 years.\n\n  From AudioFile\n\nBob Schieffer, moderator of &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; weaves this account of the show's first 50 years from interviews, transcripts, and recordings. He provides insights into the market forces and the need for network prestige that led to the original development of the show. The historic interviews with guests such as Senator Joe McCarthy, Nikita Khrushchev, and Fidel Castro, who was the focal point of a rivalry between the news division and legendary variety show host Ed Sullivan, are the heart of the book. Schieffer reads his book in the friendly clear-as-a-bell announcer's voice his listeners have come to expect. A few of his favorite commentaries are found at the end of the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4472a91c2044b45048d51d9d5ee41a698e2c4a10","amp;dn":"FACE+THE+NATION+-+Bob+Schieffer.+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4472a91c2044b45048d51d9d5ee41a698e2c4a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,114,169,28,32,68,180,80,72,213,29,157,94,228,26,105,142,44,74,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
