Come Pick Me Up is Superchunk's finest effort in years; a bright, infectious pop record that rejuvenates the group's trademark sound with the addition of producer Jim O'Rourke's candy-colored orchestral flourishes -- without losing sight of the music's punk roots. Tracks like &quot;Hello Hawk,&quot; &quot;1000 Pounds,&quot; and &quot;Pink Clouds&quot; achieve a perfect balance between Superchunk's patented brand of hyperkinetic indie rock and O'Rourke's avante-pop aesthetics, while drawing upon the talents of Chicago underground notables including saxophonist Ken Vandermark, trombonist Jeb Bishop, and cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm to bring galvanizing new dimensions to Mac McCaughan's memorably melodic songs. A stunning and unexpected return to form.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c9d6edb6498732b7d94c54650a0111ce9918661","amp;dn":"Superchunk+-+Come+Pick+Me+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c9d6edb6498732b7d94c54650a0111ce9918661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,157,110,219,100,152,115,43,125,148,197,70,80,160,17,28,233,145,134,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
