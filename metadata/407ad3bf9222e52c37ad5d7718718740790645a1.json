They first met as teenagers at his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance studioÃ¢â‚¬â€he was older and just a bit cocky; she was the beautiful waif who refused to worship the ground he walked on. Through the years their marriage strained under the pressures that many do, but it was always a uniquely passionate and creative partnership.\n\nWhen they first exchanged vows, Lisa promised to be with her husband Ã¢â‚¬Å“till death do us part.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But how many couples stop and think about what that truly means? Worth Fighting For is a remarkably candid look at what losing a partner really entailsÃ¢â‚¬â€how to care for him or her, how to make it through each day without falling into despair, and how to move forward in the second half of your life when the person you spent the first half with is gone.\n\nFor the first time, Lisa Niemi Swayze shares the details of PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty-one-month battle with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, and she describes his last days, when she simply tried to keep him comfortable. She writes with heartbreaking honesty about her grief in the aftermath of PatrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, and she openly discusses the challenges that the years without him have posed. \n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:407ad3bf9222e52c37ad5d7718718740790645a1","amp;dn":"Worth+Fighting+For+by+Lisa+Niemi+Swayze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"407ad3bf9222e52c37ad5d7718718740790645a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,122,211,191,146,34,229,44,55,173,93,119,24,113,135,64,121,6,69,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
