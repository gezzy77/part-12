A rash of uncanny occurrences, however, begins to weaken the staff's faith in science--a phantom ambulance pulls in every night, but disappears; voices echo in the elevator shaft; and a pregnant doctor's fetus seems to be developing much faster than is natural. At the goading of a spiritualist patient, some employees work to let supernatural forces rest.\n\n\n\n&quot;Riget II&quot; (1997)\n-----------------\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127392/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127392/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlot outline:\nIt starts with the birth of &quot;Little Brother&quot;, the son of diabolical murderer Aage Kroeger and the nurse Judith. Doctor Helmer is back from Haiti with some poison and is set to turn Krogshoej into a zombie. Mrs. Drusse gets hit by the phantom taxi. The two dishwashers feel that the forces of Evil are about to wreak havoc on the hospital.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40bb976d7e8713ac56f9d9fc087df08ffef0db63","amp;dn":"The+Lars+von+Trier+Collection%3A+Riget+I+%26+II+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40bb976d7e8713ac56f9d9fc087df08ffef0db63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,187,151,109,126,135,19,172,86,249,217,252,8,125,240,143,254,240,219,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
