Maps of Meaning proposes a new agenda for cultural geography, one set squarely in the context of contemporary social and cultural theory. Notions of place and space are explored through the study of elite and popular cultures, gender and sexuality, race, language and ideology. Questioning the ways in which we invest the world with meaning, the book is an introduction to both culture's geographies and the geography of culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5412b158c9e604a5c0b4433dbafdb7411e1a10b3","amp;dn":"Maps+of+Meaning%3A+An+Introduction+to+Cultural+Geography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5412b158c9e604a5c0b4433dbafdb7411e1a10b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,18,177,88,201,230,4,165,192,180,67,61,186,253,183,65,30,26,16,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
