(WSP, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-981-256-728-4\r\n\r\nThis book introduces the latest methods for the controlled growth of nanomaterial systems. The coverage includes simple and complex nanomaterial systems, ordered nanostructures and complex nanostructure arrays, and the essential conditions for the controlled growth of nanostructures with different morphologies, sizes, compositions, and microstructures. The book also discusses the dynamics of controlled growth and thermodynamic characteristics of two-dimensional nanorestricted systems. The authors introduce various novel synthesis methods for nanomaterials and nanostructures, such as hierarchical growth, heterostructures growth, doping growth and some developing template synthesis methods. In addition to discussing applications, the book reviews developing trends in nanomaterials and nanostructures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fbb911fedc49da3009c75d7173003b223646ec6","amp;dn":"Controlled+Growth+of+Nanomaterials+-+Lide+Zhang+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fbb911fedc49da3009c75d7173003b223646ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,187,145,31,237,196,157,163,0,156,117,215,23,48,3,178,35,100,110,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
