The film, which was based on the character of the Cisco Kid in the story The Caballero's Way by O. Henry, was a major innovation in Hollywood: it was the first major Western to use the new technology of sound and the first talkie to be filmed outdoors. The film made extensive use of authentic locations, filming in Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in Utah and the San Fernando Mission and the Mojave Desert in California. The movie was released on January 20, 1929 (wide); (Dec. 25, 1928 Los Angeles Premiere).\n\nIn Old Arizona was also instrumental in developing the image of the singing cowboy, with its star, Warner Baxter, singing My Tonia. Baxter went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. Other actors included Edmund Lowe, Dorothy Burgess and J. Farrell MacDonald,\n\nOther nominations included Best Director for Irving Cummings, Best Writing for Tom Barry Best Cinematography for Arthur Edeson, and Best Picture.\nProduction\n\nRaoul Walsh was set to direct and star as the Cisco Kid in this film, but had to abandon the project when a jackrabbit jumped through a windshield of a vehicle he was driving and cost Walsh an eye, after which he wore an eyepatch for the remainder of his life. Walsh never acted again but continued his illustrious career as a film director.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- In Old Arizona (1928)\nA charming, happy-go-lucky bandit in old Arizona plays cat-and-mouse with the sheriff trying to catch him while he romances a local beauty. \nArmy Sergeant Mickey Dunn sets out in pursuit of the Cisco Kid, a notorious if kind-hearted and charismatic bandit of the Old West. The Kid spends much of his loot on Tonia, the woman he loves, not realizing that she is being unfaithful to him in his absence. Soon, with her oblivious paramour off plying his trade, Tonia falls in with Dunn, drawn by the allure of a substantial reward for the Kid's capture -- dead or alive. Together, they concoct a plan to ambush and do away with the Cisco Kid once and for all.\n\nThe Cisco Kid is a gay caballero whose flair for dramatic thievery and penchant for dangerous trysts keep him just one step ahead of Sgt. Mickey Dunn. The Kid's reputation has preceded him when he approaches the local stagecoach, and he needs to fire only two warning shots to wrest the Wells Fargo box from the driver. His infatuation with a Mexican girl named Tonia MarÃƒÂ­a exposes him to near-capture, because of the seÃƒÂ±orita's double-dealing association with Dunn. Eventually, a showdown becomes imminent, and the Kid exacts a final revenge by framing Tonia so that Dunn shoots her by accident, while the Kid rides laughing off into the sunset.  \n\nTECHNCAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 5920 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime : 1:38:55\nSubtitles:None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR] \nDuration: 1:38:55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c094c11d324af1202e0f597eceb70380f7c2144","amp;dn":"In+Old+Arizona+-+The+Cisco+Kid+%281928%29+DVD5+-+Western+-+Spanish+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c094c11d324af1202e0f597eceb70380f7c2144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,9,76,17,211,36,175,18,2,224,245,151,236,235,112,56,15,124,33,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
