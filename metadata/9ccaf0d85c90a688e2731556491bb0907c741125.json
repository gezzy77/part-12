A win at Roland Garros would match Pete Sampras. It would also put him within three Slams of Roger Federer.\n\nStanding in his way is Murray, the British bad boy whom French fans love to hate. Many of them booed Murray as he took the court against Gael Monfils in the quarterfinals. Murray shot back a smile. He seems to enjoy the chip on his shoulder. He appears quite comfortable playing the role of spoiler.\n\nCommentary in English.\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.974fps 1500kbps\nAudio: 128kbps [Audio] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ccaf0d85c90a688e2731556491bb0907c741125","amp;dn":"Roland+Garros+2014+%28+French+Open+%29+-+Rafael+Nadal+vs.+Andy+Murra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ccaf0d85c90a688e2731556491bb0907c741125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,202,240,216,92,144,166,136,226,115,21,86,73,27,176,144,124,116,17,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
