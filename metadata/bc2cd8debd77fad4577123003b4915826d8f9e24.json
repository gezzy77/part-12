You have been charged with war crimes, and crimes against the very essence of sentient beings of Azeroth, as well as crimes against Azeroth itself. You are also charged for all acts committed in your name, or by those with whom you have allied.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGarrosh merely stood there, silent and still.\n\nTaran Zhu continued. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The charges are as follows: Genocide. Murder. Forcible transfer of population. Enforced disappearance of individuals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe list of the heinous crimes alone was powerful enough to make Jaina tense. She glanced over at where VolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢jin and the other Horde leaders sat. She had heard of the treatment of trolls under GarroshÃ¢â‚¬â€and what the orc had tried to do to VolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢jin himself. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enslavement. The abduction of children. Torture. The killing of prisoners. Forced pregnancy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnduin winced, and Jaina could not blame him. She thought of Alexstrasza and the horrors that had been perpetrated upon the Life-Binder personally and the red dragonflight in general. Kalec was very still beside Jaina. She looked up at him, meaning to offer him comfort, and instead found him looking down at her. He knew what was coming, and slipped an arm around her.\n\nShe braced herself.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The wanton destruction of cities, towns, and villages not justified by military or civilian necessity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Vale of Eternal Blossoms.\n\nTheramore.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What say you to these charges, Garrosh Hellscream?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGarrosh did not reply, and for a wild second, Jaina wondered if maybe, just maybe, hearing the charges so bluntly laid out before him would move the former warÃ‚Â­chief. She had heard of his anger at an underling who had slain innocents in his name, knew that the one thing even GarroshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies must give him credit for was a passionate devotion to his race. And, at one time, he had also been given credit for honor.\n\nShe stared at Garrosh, hardly daring to blink or even breathe, not knowing if she wanted him to break down and ask forgiveness for his atrocities or to stand firmÃ¢â‚¬â€ so that they could kill him with impunity.\n\nAnd then Garrosh smiled, beginning to slowly applaud, although the chains about his wrists hampered the gesture.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The show has barely commenced,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he responded, sneering, Ã¢â‚¬Å“and already I give it a standing ovation. This promises to be more entertaining than the Darkmoon Faire!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His contemptuous laughter rang through the hall. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will not say that I am guilty, for that denotes shame. Nor will I protest innocence, for I claim no such. Let the comedy begin!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-=- End Excerpt -=-\n\nComments etc, welcome\nGaoBCaaFB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2cd8debd77fad4577123003b4915826d8f9e24","amp;dn":"2014+War+Crimes+by+Christie+Golden+%28audiobook_ENG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2cd8debd77fad4577123003b4915826d8f9e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,44,216,222,189,119,250,212,87,113,35,0,59,73,21,130,109,143,158,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
