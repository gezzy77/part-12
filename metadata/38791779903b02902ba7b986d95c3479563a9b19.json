Also, history, market statistics, and safety and recycling aspects are covered. Both volumes contain a large amount of specific property data which is useful for users to readily compare different materials and align material structure with end use applications. Volume 1 concentrates mostly on polytetrafluoroethylene and polychlorotrifluoroethylene and their processing techniques â€“ which are essentially non-melt-processes â€“ used across a broad range of industries including automotive, aerospace, electronic, food, beverage, oil/gas, and medical devices. Since the first edition was published many new technical developments and market changes have taken place and new grades of materials have entered the market. This new edition is a thoroughly updated and significantly expanded revision covering new technologies and applications, and addressing the changes that have taken place in the fluoropolymer markets. Fluoroplastics, Volume 1 is an all-encompassing handbook for non-melt processible fluoropolymers â€“ a unique and invaluable reference for professionals in the fluoropolymer industry and fluoropolymer application industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptionally broad and comprehensive coverage of non-melt processible fluoropolymers processing and applications.\r\nPractical approach, written by long-standing authority in the fluoropolymers industry.\r\nNew technologies, materials and applications are included in the new edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38791779903b02902ba7b986d95c3479563a9b19","amp;dn":"Fluoroplastics+2nd+ed+Vol.+1+-+Non-Melt+Processible+Fluoropolyme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38791779903b02902ba7b986d95c3479563a9b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,121,23,121,144,59,2,144,43,167,185,134,217,92,52,121,86,58,155,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
