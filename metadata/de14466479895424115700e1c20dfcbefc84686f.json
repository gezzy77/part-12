Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson  are two of Australia's most respected rock journalists, while John O'Donnell is the record industry head who famously signed Silverchair.\n\n This is the first time a list like this has ever been compiled in Australia.\n\n The Top 10 pretty much picks itself with Midnight Oil, AC/DC and Cold Chisel, but the rest of the list covers varied terrain with classic artists like The  Church (No. 33) and The Angels (No. 64) alongside Slim Dusty (No. 24) and Kylie Minogue (No. 98).\n\n READNFO for the complete list\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Best_Australian_Albums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Best_Australian_Albums&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  Enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de14466479895424115700e1c20dfcbefc84686f","amp;dn":"VA+-+Songs+From+The+100+Best+Australian+Albums+5CD+Mp3+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de14466479895424115700e1c20dfcbefc84686f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,20,70,100,121,137,84,36,17,87,0,225,194,13,252,190,252,132,104,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
