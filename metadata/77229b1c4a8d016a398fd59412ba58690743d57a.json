If you studied mechanics in high school, you probably know that a bullet hit cannot cause a body to start moving against the direction of the bullet (even if there is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“jet forceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of tissue blown out of the body). This means that the Warren commission was lying about where that bullet came from. Operation Mockingbird was of course in full swing in the 1960s, and the CIA made sure that the news media were doing their best to discredit and ridicule anyone who doubted the false official story (in case you are wondering, the CIA continues to manipulate news media today).\n\nEnjoy the books and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to seed :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77229b1c4a8d016a398fd59412ba58690743d57a","amp;dn":"Books+on+John+F.+Kennedy+assassination%2C+Jim+Garrison%2C+CIA%2C+and+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77229b1c4a8d016a398fd59412ba58690743d57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,34,155,28,74,141,1,106,57,143,213,148,18,186,88,105,7,67,213,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
