But it is more than that. It voices one man's outrage not only at the extremes of human violence, but also at the duplicity and self-interest of the Western Governments - most notably, the British, who tacitly accepted or actively aided that violence.\n\nThe combination of the dramatic events and the shocking exposures combined with the author's forthright and perceptive style makes The Biafra Story as compelling a read today as when it was first written.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Biafra-Story-Making-African/dp/1844155234/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374772218&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=biafra+story&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Biafra-Story-Making-African/dp/1844155234/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374772218&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=biafra+story&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8496b176582904262416822b514237116075c06a","amp;dn":"The+Biafra+Story%3A+The+Making+of+an+African+Legend+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8496b176582904262416822b514237116075c06a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,150,177,118,88,41,4,38,36,22,130,43,81,66,55,17,96,117,192,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
