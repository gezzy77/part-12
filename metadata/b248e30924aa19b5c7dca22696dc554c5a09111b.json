Using a simple wizard, you assign a network drive letter to the FTP Server. By connecting through a virtual drive, there is no need to learn a separate FTP client interface. You access and edit files on the server the same way that you interact with files on your local PC.\n\nWebDrive is the only FTP Client that supports additional protocols such as WebDAV, SFTP and Amazon S3 and maps a drive letter to each of these servers. Please select the type of computer below to get more information and a free trial of the WebDrive FTP Client.\n\n\n\n#### Includes a real license key. Should be good for future versions. Just download the latest version from http://www.webdrive.com/download/index.html\n\nIf this doesn't work, use the included installer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b248e30924aa19b5c7dca22696dc554c5a09111b","amp;dn":"Webdrive_v9.17-and-later","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b248e30924aa19b5c7dca22696dc554c5a09111b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,72,227,9,36,170,25,181,199,220,162,38,150,220,85,76,90,9,17,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
