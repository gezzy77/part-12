It has become their most commercially successful recording to date and has sold over 1,400,000 copies making it the 25th most successful single of all time in the UK.\nThe lyrics were originally inspired after lead singer and front man Philip Oakey read a story in a &quot;trashy tabloid&quot;. Originally conceived as a male solo, Oakey was inspired by the film A Star Is Born and decided to turn the song in to a conflicting duet with one of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two teenage female vocalists. Susan Ann Sulley was asked to take on the role. Up until then she and the other female vocalist Joanne Catherall had only been assigned backing vocals; Sulley says she was chosen only through luck of the draw. There are two more realistic reasons for her choice, that Sulley was the better singer and/or that Catherall, a very introverted character at the time, shied away from the role. Musicians Jo Callis and Philip Adrian Wright created a synthesizer score to accompany the lyrics which was much harsher than the version that was actually released. Initial versions of the song were recorded but Virgin Records appointed producer Martin Rushent was unhappy with this version. He and Callis remixed it, giving it a softer, and in Oakey's opinion, &quot;poppy&quot; sound. Oakey hated the new version and thought it the weakest track on Dare, resulting in one of his infamous rows with Rushent.Oakey disliked it so much that it was relegated to the last track on the B-side of the vinyl version of the album.\n\nLyrics:\nYou were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\nWhen I met you\nI picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around\nTurned you into someone new\nNow five years later on you've got the world at your feet\nSuccess has been so easy for you\nBut don't forget it's me who put you where you are now\nAnd I can put you back down too\n\nDon't, don't you want me\nYou know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me\nDon't, don't you want me\nYou know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me\nIt's much too late to find\nYou think you've changed your mind\nYou'd better change it back or we will both be sorry\n\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\n\nI was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\nThat much is true\nBut even then I knew I'd find a much better place\nEither with or without you\nThe five years we have had have been such good times\nI still love you\nBut now I think it's time I lived my life on my own\nI guess it's just what I must do\n\nDon't, don't you want me\nYou know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me\nDon't, don't you want me\nYou know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me\nIt's much too late to find\nYou think you've changed your mind\nYou'd better change it back or we will both be sorry\n\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\n\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh\nDon't you want me baby, Don't you want me oh ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477111b0f4ad4afd930c4f21bf6b0a0db559fc13","amp;dn":"The+Human+League+-+Don%5C%27t+You+Want+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477111b0f4ad4afd930c4f21bf6b0a0db559fc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,113,17,176,244,173,74,253,147,12,79,33,191,107,10,13,181,89,252,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
