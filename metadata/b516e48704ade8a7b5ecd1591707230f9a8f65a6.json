It was recorded between January 6 and 13, 1987 and originally released on July 6, 1987.\n\nIn the Dark was the band&amp;#039;s first album in six years, and its first studio album since 1980&amp;#039;s Go to Heaven. It became unexpectedly popular. The peppy &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest ranking the band would ever achieve, and a frequently played music video on MTV. &quot;Hell in a Bucket&quot; and &quot;Throwing Stones&quot; also achieved significant album oriented rock radio airplay. The album itself reached the top ten of the Billboard 200 album chart, again the highest ranking the group would ever have.\n\nMost of the songs on this album had been played by the Dead since 1982 or 1983, which gave them a five year edge on perfecting these songs for this album. After the critically panned Go to Heaven, which contained songs that were mostly under a year old, the maturity of In The Dark was significantly more appreciated.\n\nIn the Dark was released on CD in 1987 by Arista Records[1] before being rereleased in 2000 by BMG International. It was then remastered, expanded, and released as part of the Beyond Description (1973-1989) 12-CD box set in October 2004. The remastered version was later released separately on CD, on April 11, 2006, by Rhino Records.\n\n# &quot;Black Muddy River&quot; (Garcia, Hunter) ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:07\n# &quot;Throwing Stones&quot; (Barlow, Weir) ÃƒÂ¢?? 7:20\n# &quot;Tons of Steel&quot; (Mydland) ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:18\n# &quot;West L.A.
