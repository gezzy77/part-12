Entertaining, illuminating and packed with information, Aim for the Heart is the first book to cover his full life in the movies, showing how as both actor and filmmaker Eastwood aims for the heart of the drama, whatever the story.\n\nHoward Hughes follows Eastwood's craft through over 50 movies. He looks at his beginnings in fifties B-movies and in TV's Rawhide and his launch into superstardom in Sergio Leone's sixties spaghetti westerns. Later roles are discussed, including Beguiled, The Bridges of Madison County and Million Dollar Baby. Since 1970, Eastwood has enjoyed parallel success as director-producer of his own Malpaso Productions, with Bird, Mystic River and Letters from Iwo Jima, demonstrating formidable directing credentials.\n\nAlongside details of all his movies, EastwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story is illustrated with film stills, glimpses behind the scenes, and rare poster advertising material. Also featuring the most comprehensive credits filmography ever compiled on EastwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, as star and director.\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An exhaustive work, fine as a reference resource for someone who needs a little more information than the Internet Movie Database can provide.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- The Weekly Standard\nPraise for Howard Hughes:\n\nOn Stagecoach to Tombstone:\n\n&quot;Hold your horses for next month's release of Stagecoach to Tombstone: The Filmgoer's Guide to Great Westerns, author Howard Hughes' detailed tome on 27 classic films.&quot; - Newsday.com\n\n&quot;Written with panache and fresh insightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦buy it!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dave Worrall, Cinema Retro\n\n&quot;A deftly written collection of essays, full of fascinating insight, this will be a must for fellow travellers on the sagebrush trail.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Howard Maxford, Film Review\nOn Once Upon a Time in the Italian West:\n\n&quot;Howard Hughes has written a well-researched, detailed, no-nonsense and above all enthusiastic guide to twenty of the best Italian Westerns from A Fistful of Dollars to My Name is Nobody.

It is not a biography on Eastwood himself.\n\nI like how the book separates each of Eastwoods films into genre, so when your reading the book, you read about all his western films, and then all of his films where he plays the role of a cop ect.\n\nIf you are a fan of Clint Eastwood and are courious about the facts behind each of his films, you will enjoy this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e498ded0c89e8bbb30192aca2b08af90858c76e","amp;dn":"Aim+for+the+Heart+The+Films+of+Clint+Eastwood+%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e498ded0c89e8bbb30192aca2b08af90858c76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,73,141,237,12,137,232,187,179,1,146,172,162,176,138,249,8,88,199,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
