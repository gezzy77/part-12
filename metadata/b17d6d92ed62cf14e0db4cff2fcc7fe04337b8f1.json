G. Asmundson PhD, Steven Taylor Phd\n2005 \nEnglish\nISBN: 1593851464, 1572309938\n212 Pages\nPDF\n808 KB\n\n\nWhere do you go for help when no one believes you're really sick? The doctors canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t explain your symptoms, but you know thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something wrong because you can sense it in your body. Living with the specter of an unresolved health issue isn't just painful, it's isolating. The preoccupation and stress it causes can disrupt your career or interfere with personal relationships. If you continually experience symptoms of illness, or worry a lot about disease, you may be suffering from health anxiety--a condition that can produce physical effects of its own, including muscle tension, nausea, and a quickened heart rate. \n\nIn this compassionate and empowering book, noted psychologists Gordon J. G. Asmundson and Steven Taylor provide simple and accurate self-tests designed to help you understand health anxiety and the role it might be playing in how you feel. Concrete examples and helpful exercises show you how to change thought and behavior patterns that contribute to the aches, pains, and anxiety you're experiencing. The authors also explain how to involve friends and family--and when to seek professional help--as you learn to stay well without worry.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17d6d92ed62cf14e0db4cff2fcc7fe04337b8f1","amp;dn":"Its+Not+All+in+Your+Head+-+How+Worrying+about+Your+Health+Could+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17d6d92ed62cf14e0db4cff2fcc7fe04337b8f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,125,109,146,237,98,207,20,224,219,76,255,47,204,127,224,67,55,184,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
