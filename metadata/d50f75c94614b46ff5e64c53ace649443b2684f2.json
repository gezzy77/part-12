Folk-art motifs, florals, nature themes, neoclassical designs, and trompe l'oeil effects adorn a variety of wooden pieces, all clearly presented with step-by-step directions and color photos. There's even a charming circus-tent bookcase and a chair painted to look like fake fur. Most of the technique are fairly simple, and the results are delightful.\nAn instruction manual on transforming ready-to-build items into individual works of art. It also advises on giving new life to second-hand pieces. Special templates show large-scale &quot;deconstructed&quot; designs so that the reader can copy the templates. Each project is broken up into simple stages, and different effects and design variations are featured on a range of furniture, including different styles of chairs, tables, frames, dressers and cabinets. The manual covers how to apply scumble glazing, decorative metal leafing, dry brushing, antique waxing and distressing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d50f75c94614b46ff5e64c53ace649443b2684f2","amp;dn":"Painted+Wooden+Furniture+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d50f75c94614b46ff5e64c53ace649443b2684f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,15,117,201,70,20,180,111,245,230,76,83,172,230,73,68,59,38,132,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
