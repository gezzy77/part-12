These pre-selected combinations of rendering option settings, like resolution, anti-aliasing and texture quality, represent different, successively more advanced levels of visual quality.\n\nWhen running 3DMark Vantage with one of the presets selected, the benchmark produces an official score for that preset. Instead of the single default setting of previous 3DMarks, there are four Presets available for Entry, Performance, High and Extreme visual quality.\nRequirements:\nProcessor\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Requirement: SSE2 support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Recommendation: A dual-core processor with performance equivalent to Intel Core 2 Duo E6600, AMD Athlon X2 6000+, or higher\n\nGraphics Card\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Requirement: Fully DirectX10-compliant graphics hardware\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Recommended: 512MB of video memory (Needed to run every Preset)\n\nDisplay Device\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Requirement: Capable of 1280x1024 resolution\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Recommendation: Capable of 1920x1200 resolution (Needed to run every Preset)\n\nSystem Memory\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Requirement: Windows Vista minimum requirement\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Recommendation: 2 GB or more\n\nHard Disk\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Requirement: 1 GB of free hard disk space\n\nWhat's new in 3DMark Vantage 1.1.0:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Trial Edition has been removed\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Basic Edition is now free\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Added display scaling to improve display compatibility\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· PPU acceleration of the CPU tests is now disabled by default\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Re-compiled with Visual Studio 2010\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Updated the SystemInfo component to version 0\n\n\nTested And Working\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2c30d39beaf4b41a553bafcef15213f3536df4","amp;dn":"3DMark+Vantage+Professional+1.1.0.0%28Murlok%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2c30d39beaf4b41a553bafcef15213f3536df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,44,48,211,155,234,244,180,26,85,59,175,206,241,82,19,243,83,109,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
