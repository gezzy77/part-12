As with these other programs, you could lose weight, attract more beneficial relationships, and find a greater state of balance in very little time. But what if, on top of all that, the program helped you create not just a fast change, but a permanent one? What if you had a plan that has all the benefits of a short-term overhaul but with the guidance necessary to ensure that it's the last program you'll ever need?\n\n Over two thousand years ago, the Indian sage Patanjali compiled what we now know as The Yoga Sutras, a concise text that forms the basis of everything we know today about the philosophy of the yogic path. In The One Plan, Yogi Cameron lays out a fifty-two-week structure based on Patanjali's teachings as well as the ancient medical system of Ayurveda; it delivers the proven authenticity of an ancient path but has been adapted to take your life in the modern world into account.\n As a practical and accessible guide to help you improve your life, The One Plan will provide you with specific exercises and regimens for crafting an effective daily routine, tips and reminders for becoming truly grounded in that routine, real-life stories and inspiration, practical tools for responding to life's inevitable struggles and setbacks, and even a section on eating the Ayurveda way. By following the One Plan, you will live a life of health, balance, and purpose.\n Your commitment to the One Plan may last fifty-two weeks, but the changes you make will last a lifetime.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21fe2744e35d02f6b529066fa5d452a4f35e6db5","amp;dn":"The+One+Plan%3A+A+Week-by-Week+Guide+to+Restoring+Your+Natural+Hea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21fe2744e35d02f6b529066fa5d452a4f35e6db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,254,39,68,227,93,2,246,181,41,6,111,165,212,82,164,243,94,109,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
