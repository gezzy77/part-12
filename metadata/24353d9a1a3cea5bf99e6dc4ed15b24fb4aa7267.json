The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€and take any risk, physical, mental, or moralÃ¢â‚¬â€to gain the edge they need to win.\n \nTyler Hamilton was once one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-liked and top-ranked cyclistsÃ¢â‚¬â€a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stagesÃ¢â‚¬â€and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacleÃ¢â‚¬â€winning the gold medal at the 2004 OlympicsÃ¢â‚¬â€his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.\n \nFrom the exhilaration of his early, naÃƒÂ¯ve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong.\n \nA journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, The Secret Race is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.\n\nGeneral Information\n====================\nTitle: The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs\nAuthor: Tyler Hamilton , Daniel Coyle\nRead By: Sean Runnette\nGenre: Audiobook - Non-Fiction\nAbridged: No\n\nFile Information\n=================\nNumber of MP3s: 18\nTotal Duration: 11:23:35\nTotal MP3 Size: 470 MB\nEncoded At: 96 kbit/s, 44.1 KHz, Stereo\nID3 Tags: Set, v2.3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24353d9a1a3cea5bf99e6dc4ed15b24fb4aa7267","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Race+%282012%29+-+Tyler+Hamilton+%26amp%3B+Daniel+Coyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24353d9a1a3cea5bf99e6dc4ed15b24fb4aa7267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,53,61,154,26,60,234,91,249,158,109,196,237,21,178,79,180,170,114,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
