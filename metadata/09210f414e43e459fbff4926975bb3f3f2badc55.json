They led off the album with &quot;She's a Runaway,&quot; a song of spousal abuse and revenge that indicated a higher social consciousness than much of the rest of the album, which was typified by &quot;Misery,&quot; in which the singer laments that his girlfriend sleeps around. At their best, on &quot;She's a Runaway,&quot; &quot;Fadeaway,&quot; and &quot;Angels,&quot; the BoDeans came up with infectious riffs and made maximum use of the sweet-and-sour vocal interaction between the conventional voice of Kurt Neumann and Sammy Llanas' distinctive nasal whine. Much of the album was slight, but there was enough of an individual sound to the better material to think of the BoDeans as a band of considerable promise.\n\n2009 Expanded Edition Also Includes:\n\n12. Try And Try\n13. Sail Away (Demo)\n14. Amen (Demo)\n15. Small Town Ways (Demo)\n16. Janey (new recording)\n17. Turn Your Radio On (Demo)\n\nRhino presents the Collector's Edition of the BoDeans first album, which includes a remastered and expanded version of the original Slash/Warner Bros. \n\nThe unforgettable opening notes of the BoDeans' &quot;She's A Runaway&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€the album's lead trackÃ¢â‚¬â€heralded a singular sound that was true to its own style and the unique sound of the group. Rock journalist Dave Marsh writes in the liner notes: &quot;Such music speaks to those who seek it and waylays those who stumble across it. Whether its audience is measured in millions or thousands, it's the only kind of rock 'n' roll (or most anything else in the cultural arena) that counts.&quot; \n\nProducer T-Bone Burnett, who recently produced the critically acclaimed Alison Krauss and Robert Plant album Raising Sand as well as the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack released in 2000, recorded the album in Los Angeles, capturing the beauty of Neumann and Llanas' contrasting voices as they sang a batch of songs sophisticated enough to know when to tell a story or when to just speak to the moment. \n\nThe original, 11-song album contains essential tracks such as &quot;Still The Night,&quot; &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Fadeaway.&quot; Among the six bonus tracks included on the Collector's Edition are &quot;Try And Try&quot; (&quot;Fadeaway&quot; b-side) and &quot;Janey,&quot; a song recorded in 2008 available here for the first time. For the set, Rhino also unearths four unreleased demosÃ¢â‚¬â€including &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;Small Town Ways&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€that Neumann and Llanas recorded in college, where they reportedly enrolled solely to gain access to the school's four-track recorder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09210f414e43e459fbff4926975bb3f3f2badc55","amp;dn":"BoDeans+-+Love+%26amp%3B+Hope+%26amp%3B+Sex+%26amp%3B+Dreams+%5B1986%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09210f414e43e459fbff4926975bb3f3f2badc55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,33,15,65,78,67,228,89,251,255,73,38,151,91,179,243,242,186,220,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
