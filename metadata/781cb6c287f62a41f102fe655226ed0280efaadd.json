David \nMacLean (Jimmy Hunt) is a 12-year-old astronomy buff who is stunned to see a \nflying saucer landing in the sand pit beyond his backyard. His father, George \n(Leif Erickson), ventures out to look the next morning and mysteriously \ndisappears. David's mother, Mary (Hillary Brooke), worriedly calls police, but \nthey are quickly swallowed up by the sand in the backyard. Later, George and the \ntwo cops return, but their personalities are markedly different having been \ntaken over by the Martians. As David tries to find help, everyone around him \ncomes under the frightening zombie-like spell. He finally encounters two \nbelievers in Dr. Blake (Helena Carter) and Dr. Kelston (Arthur Franz). \nDiscovering David's shocking story to be true, the doctors call in the military \nsetting up a confrontation that escalates when David and Dr. Blake are taken \ncaptive within the Martian craft. The soldiers race to save the pair from the \ngreen menace leading to an explosive finale that involves bullets, grenades, \nTNT, and a spectacular alien ray gun that can melt stone.\n\nCAST\nHelena Carter            - Dr. Patricia Blake\nArthur Franz             - Dr. Stuart Kelston\nJimmy Hunt               - David Maclean\nLeif Erickson            - George MacLean\nHillary Brooke           - Mary MacLean\nMorris Ankrum            - Col.

According to \nrecent interviews, John Seitz, the cinematographer, confirmed that the film was \nplanned in great detail to be filmed in 3D but that the last minute it was \ndiscovered that no camera was available. Nonetheless, it is claimed that all of \nthe sets were constructed at Republic Studios to be shot in 3D and that the \nartificial separation of set elements is confirmation of this design intention. \nMeanwhile, the only documentary evidence for a 3D production is a claimed \nnewspaper advertisement placed by the producers (not the studio) while the film \nwas in pre-production, and no official records are known to exist to throw \nfurther light onto the matter.\n\n    * The special effects department used condoms to create the &quot;bubbles&quot; on the \nwalls of the underground tunnels.\n\n    * This was actually one of the first science fiction scripts written in the \n1950s. The revised version of the script was completed in September 1950. The \nfilm wasn't produced until 1952 and released in early 1953.\n\n    * Among the cost-cutting measures made during filming was the elimination of \nCricket, David's dog. The use of animals during filming almost always takes more \ntime, and therefore more money, a luxury that director William Cameron Menzies \ndidn't have.\n\n    * Richard Deacon's film debut.\n\n    * In one scene, Dr. Kelston refers to the &quot;Lubbock Lights&quot; and to a &quot;Captain \nMantell.&quot; These were real life U.F.O. events that created a national wide \nsensation in their day. The photographs shown by Dr Kelston are actual \nphotographs of the Lubbock Lights that appeared in newspapers and magazines.\n\n    * According to script supervisor Mary Yerke, director and production \ndesigner William Cameron Menzies filled 12 notebooks with charcoal sketches \ndepicting every scene he planned to shoot. Just days before principle \nphotography, all of these storyboard sketches disappeared from the production \noffice.\n\n    * This film was shot on the new single strip Eastman Color negative. \nCinecolor Labs then produced the trailers and release prints in the three color \nCinecolor process. When the Cinecolor Labs went bankrupt, the original elements \nand printing matrices were seized and sold for salvage.\n\n    * The screenplay was originally optioned by Arthur Gardner and Jules V. \nLevy. The option expired before they could get a production off the ground. The \nrights then went to producer Edward L. Alperson, who was Levy's boss at the \ntime.\n\n    * In August 1957, this film was being shown on a double bill with This \nIsland Earth (1955).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
