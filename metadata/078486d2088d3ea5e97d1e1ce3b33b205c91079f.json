The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic warfare aircraft. United States Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles can be distinguished from other U.S. Eagle variants by darker camouflage and conformal fuel tanksmounted along the engine intakes.\n\n\nCredit to *xxxtsh* from boerse.bz for the Release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078486d2088d3ea5e97d1e1ce3b33b205c91079f","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Miliviz+-+F-15E+Strike+Eagle+w%2FSP1+%28v1.01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078486d2088d3ea5e97d1e1ce3b33b205c91079f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,132,134,210,8,141,62,165,233,125,30,28,227,179,59,32,92,145,7,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
