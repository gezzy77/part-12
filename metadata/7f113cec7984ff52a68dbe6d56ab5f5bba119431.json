George Gershwin of Brooklyn, N.Y., alone and with his brother, Ira, wrote many of the finest American popular songs and orchestral pieces. \nThe music of George and Ira Gershwin has long been a part of the American consciousness. The opening clarinet glissando from Rhapsody in Blue, the taxi horn theme from An American in Paris and the songs -- &quot;I Got Rhythm,&quot; &quot;Embraceable You,&quot; &quot;The Man I Love,&quot; &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me,&quot; &quot;Fascinating Rhythm,&quot; and so many others -- are instantly recognizable. Even the mention of the name &quot;Gershwin&quot; brings to mind the glamour and sophistication of the 1920s and 1930s, personified by the brothers who helped to give a musical voice to the time.\nBut if the Gershwins symbolize a time, their music and words transcend it. The proliferating performances and recordings of their music testify to its enduring popularity, and George and Ira continue to be the subjects of popular as well as scholarly study.
