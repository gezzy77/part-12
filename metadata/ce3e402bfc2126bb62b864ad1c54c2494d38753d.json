Baxxter, Rick Jordan and Ferris Bueller, who together with producer Jens Thele previously joined forces as the remix team the Loop. During the 1980s, Baxxter and Jordan also scored a series of club hits as Celebrate the Nun. Debuting with the single &quot;ValleÃƒÂ© de Larmes,&quot; Scooter scored their breakthrough hit with the follow-up &quot;Hyper Hyper,&quot; which sold over 700,000 copies in Germany alone. A series of Top Five hits followed, including &quot;Move Your Ass!,&quot; &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Endless Summer&quot; (all later collected on the trio's 1995 debut LP ...And the Beat Goes On); with 1996's Our Happy Hardcore, Scooter also scored their first British Top 20 hit, &quot;Back in the U.K.&quot; Wicked appeared later that same year, and featured the techno-ballad &quot;Break It Up&quot;; in the wake of 1997's Age of Love, Bueller exited Scooter, and was replaced by Axel Coon for No Time to Chill. Back to the Heavyweight Jam followed in 1999. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tKontor Records\nCatalog:\t\t4250117624569\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Full Moon\n02.I'm A Raver, Baby\n03.Army Of Hardcore (Radio Edit)\n04.4 A.M.
