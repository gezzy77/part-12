He became a naturalized US citizen in 1990.[1]\n\nAnka first became famous as a teen idol in the late 1950s and 1960s with hit songs like &quot;Diana'&quot;, &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, and &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder&quot;. He went on to write such well-known music as the theme for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and one of Tom Jones's biggest hits, &quot;She's a Lady&quot;, and the English lyrics for Frank Sinatra's signature song, &quot;My Way&quot;.\n\nIn 1983, he co-wrote with Michael Jackson the song &quot;I Never Heard&quot;, which was retitled and released in 2009 under the name &quot;This Is It&quot;.[2] An additional song that Jackson co-wrote with Anka from this 1983 session, &quot;Love Never Felt So Good&quot;, has since been discovered, and will be released in the near future. \n\n\n\n\n\n21 Golden Hits 1963\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.
