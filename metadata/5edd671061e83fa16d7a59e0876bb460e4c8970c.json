If you are looking for fun and history at the same time, these lectures are worth your time and investment--still worth the investment if you are just looking for great laughs!\n\n\n\n\n3)  Sigmund Freud \nWith a life measured out in cigar-cutters and cocaine wraps, Sigmund Freud was clearly a genius. Here was a man who looked around the world at the start of the 20th century, saw brutal empires, millions being sucked into soulless factories, impending world war, and said: &quot;I know what causes the problems - we want to have sex with our mothers.&quot; Mark Steel reveals the absurdity and complexity of that genius as he travels from Vienna to London in Freud's wake. Our Sigmund, played by Martin Hyder, steps out of the darkness like Harry Lime, snorts cocaine like Al Pacino in Scarface, and treats his friends like Richard Ashcroft in the video for Bittersweet Symphony.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1537 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 18\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5edd671061e83fa16d7a59e0876bb460e4c8970c","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Mark+Steel+Lectures+Series+1+to+3+03of18+Sigmund+Freud+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5edd671061e83fa16d7a59e0876bb460e4c8970c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,221,103,16,97,232,63,161,109,122,89,224,135,107,180,96,228,200,151,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
