Along the drive, Young recounted insightful and introspective stories from his youth to filmmaker Jonathan Demme. Demme, a long-time fan and collaborator, captured these tales of Young's childhood and masterfully weaved them together with his mesmerizing music including songs from the 2010 album Le Noise and powerful renditions of classics including Ã¢â‚¬Å“OhioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Hey Hey, My My&quot;, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Believe in YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and previously unreleased songs &quot;Leia&quot; and &quot;You Never Call.&quot; Through the tunes and the tales, Demme portrays a personal, retrospective look into the heart and soul of the artist.\n\nTracklist:\n\nJourneys: A Jonathan Demme Picture\n\n1 Peaceful Valley Boulevard\n2 Ohio\n3 Down By The River\n4 Sign Of Love\n5 Rumbling\n6 Love And War\n7 Leia\n8 After The Gold Rush\n9 I Believe In You\n10 My, My, Hey, Hey (Out Of The Blue)\n11 You Never Call\n12 Hitchhiker\n13 Walk With Me\n14 Credits (Helpless)\n\nSpecial Features\n15 Journey To Slamdance: A Conversation With Neil Young &amp; Jonathan Demme\n16 92Y Talks With Neil Young &amp; Jonathan Demme\n17 Making Journeys\n18 Theatrical Trailer\n19 Previews: Additional Sony titles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345ee07e2989fc6a7fe29ad8971144657c335038","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Journeys+-+2012+%28DVD9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345ee07e2989fc6a7fe29ad8971144657c335038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,94,224,126,41,137,252,106,127,226,154,216,151,17,68,101,124,51,80,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
