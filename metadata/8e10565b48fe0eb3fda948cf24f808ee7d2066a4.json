Applying their harmonica arrangements mostly to popular standards, their sound was unusual for that (or indeed any) era, achieving a full ensemble effect via instruments that are rarely used in tandem in popular music. Heard several decades later, their material undoubtedly has a dated novelty aspect -- they preferred sentimental tunes that can sound corny to later generations -- but can also sound fresh, due to the unusual instrumentation. The Harmonicats were still recording for Columbia in the late '60s and tried their hand at contemporary material like &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot; on their 1966 LP What's New, Harmonicats?. The Harmonicats continued performing even after the Murad's death in 1996.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-harmonicats-p25622/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-harmonicats-p25622/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KY6CJY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KY6CJY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
