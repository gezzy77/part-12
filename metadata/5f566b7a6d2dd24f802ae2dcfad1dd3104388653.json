They had been experimenting with acoustic songs since their first album, 1986's Mechanical Resonance, and offered up a more honest and simply presented version of the era's blazing guitar anthems than their lipsticked, spandexed contemporaries. Despite a six-year break in the late '90s, they've also managed to stick around, releasing decent studio and live albums throughout the 2000s. Following 2011's Twisted Wires &amp; the Acoustic Sessions album, they've pulled their amps out of storage and returned with a solid set of straight-ahead rockers and tasteful acoustic numbers on 2014's Simplicity. Just a year prior, they released the thrashing single &quot;Taste My Pain,&quot; which strove to reclaim their heavier tendencies, overcompensating just a bit. But throughout Simplicity, Tesla focus on simple, well-executed songs and unencumbered, stripped-down production, as emphasized by standouts like &quot;So Divine...,&quot; &quot;Other Than Me,&quot; and the ballad &quot;Life Is a River.&quot; Their mix of hard rock, blues, and occasional heartland flourishes on this collection should please fans, showing that their heads are still in the right place. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD {Tesla Electric TSL-CD-700019}\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Mp3\n02.Ricochet\n03.Rise And Fall\n04.So Divine...\n05.Cross My Heart\n06.Honestly\n07.Flip Side!\n08.Other Than Me\n09.Break Of Dawn\n10.Burnout To Fade\n11.Life Is A River\n12.Sympathy\n13.Time Bomb\n14.'Til That Day\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f566b7a6d2dd24f802ae2dcfad1dd3104388653","amp;dn":"Tesla+-+Simplicity+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f566b7a6d2dd24f802ae2dcfad1dd3104388653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,86,107,122,109,45,210,79,128,42,226,220,250,209,221,49,4,56,134,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
