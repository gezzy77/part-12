The type was also built under license in India and Czechslovakia, and without license in China until the late 2000s. Designed as a Mach-2 light tactical fighter, its original prototype, the Ye-6/1, was first flown in 1958. The first production variant of the type, designated the MiG-21F, appeared in 1960 and its improved sub-variant, the MiG-21F-13 (Type 74, NATO reporting name Fishbed-C), was made available for export by 1961. It was a simplified daytime short-range, clear-weather interceptor and tactical fighter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:810c1bc7a62770bcac18384a10454dcfb4f0d29b","amp;dn":"Mikoyan-Gurevich+MiG-21+%28Osprey+Air+Vanguard+14%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"810c1bc7a62770bcac18384a10454dcfb4f0d29b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,12,27,199,166,39,112,188,172,24,56,74,16,69,77,207,180,240,210,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
