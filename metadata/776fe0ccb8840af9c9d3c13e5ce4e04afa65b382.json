The team is testing a trio of Star Wars tall tales. First up Adam and Jamie tackle TaunTaun Sleeping bag. Then, it's Star Wars Swing. In Episode IV: A New Hope, Luke, makes a grappling hook swing across a chasm with Leia in one arm. With the help of actress Sophia Bush and a battalion of Storm troopers, Adam and Jamie recreate the scene to find out if it's possible. And finally in Tek-Swee Tree Swing, Kari, Grant and Tory delve into Return of the Jedi and test if Ewok's primitive weaponry could really have taken down the might of the Empire.\n\nP.S. Although this episode has been uploaded previously, it is the one without the tweets.\n\nSo you get a nice and clean image.\n\nEnjoy.
