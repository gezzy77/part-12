A powerful way to enhance your meditation. \n\nThe vibration produced by the sound of Om chanting is said to correspond with the original vibration that first arose at the time of creation. It is an auspicious mantra that has been used for deep meditation for thousands of years. \n\nDuring a traditional Om mantra meditation, you focus your attention on your third eye (the space on your forehead between your eyes). While this technique is not essential, you might like to experiment with visualizations as you listen to this mantra. Try imagining that the sound is emanating from your third eye, or alternatively you may also like to imagine that the sound is emanating from your heart, or that the sound is simply enveloping your entire body. \n\nJust relax and open your mind to the sound of the Om chants. Surrender to the vibrations. Let go, and allow the sound to gently wash away your thoughts, as you merge your mind with the mystical sound of Om. \n\n60 min \n\nMP3 - 320 kbps - CBR \n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c53d4542f2a15cf154304bb82657aa0a26ed9d6","amp;dn":"Christopher+Lloyd+Clarke+-+Om+Mantra+%28Theta%29+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c53d4542f2a15cf154304bb82657aa0a26ed9d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,83,212,84,47,42,21,207,21,67,4,187,130,101,122,160,162,110,217,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
