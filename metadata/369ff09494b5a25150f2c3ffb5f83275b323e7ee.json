He goes to town, posing as a merchant, explains his Australian accent, and learns that Maria Singleton, owner of a large ranch, and Rodney Ackroyd (who never explains where he got his name), another ranch owner and Miss Singleton's fiancÃƒÂ©e, are the leaders of the cattlemen against the sheep-men. Romance tugs at Morgan and Miss Singleton, who quickly decides that Morgan has a much better name than Rodney (and other attributes) but the cattle-vs.-sheep feud keeps them apart. Until they meet in the street for a showdown gunfight following a disastrous clash between the cattle and sheep factions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:369ff09494b5a25150f2c3ffb5f83275b323e7ee","amp;dn":"Montana++%28Western+1950%29++Errol+Flynn%2C+Alexis+Smith+%26amp%3B+S.Z.+Sa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"369ff09494b5a25150f2c3ffb5f83275b323e7ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,159,240,148,148,181,162,81,80,242,195,255,181,248,50,117,179,35,231,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
