It has detailed pictures, information on hair styles, shoes, clothes and accessories from Ancient Greece up through the 20th century. It also explains which styles came and went at which time during the era, and sometimes tells why. It also has a good description of the items it focuses on. But it focuses mainly on the 1200s-1800s, almost totally ignoring the Romans, Saxons, Normans, and lacking in the Greek, and the 20th century. Really in the 1900s it only goes up to the 1950s and disregards a lot of cashual dress. It only covers civilizations in the European and US area, not including the American Indians or the US colonists. Suggested book for anyone that needs information on men's costume during the medieval ages or the 1800s in Europe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9b105a98f0e6fd5cde5d8fbd3cda486179504b","amp;dn":"Costume+Reference+-+History+of+Mens+Costume+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9b105a98f0e6fd5cde5d8fbd3cda486179504b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,155,16,90,152,240,230,253,92,222,93,143,189,60,218,72,97,121,80,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
