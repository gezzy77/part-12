The cynical Lonni is suspicious of Ellen's motives for coming to Africa, while Ellen is annoyed by Lonni's male chauvinism. Although Lonni warns Ellen that Dr. Mary has travelled up the Congo River to help the victims of a fever epidemic, Ellen is determined to join her. That evening, fed up with capturing animals for zoos, Lonni tells his Dutch business partner, Huysman, that he is quitting. Huysman, who has spent seven years searching for gold, urges Lonni to remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x464, 25.000 fps, 1729 Kbps, 01h31m59s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Greek, Italian, Russian, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ighjcp8v5/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/a03artb1p/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/q9tguplpp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6qovlcmy5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bb6gmjh9p/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac40c801515e86b7bf59750877adc284a8dcdf7f","amp;dn":"White+Witch+Doctor+%5B1953+-+USA%5D+%28Robert+Mitchum%29+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac40c801515e86b7bf59750877adc284a8dcdf7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,64,200,1,81,94,134,183,191,89,117,8,119,173,194,132,168,220,223,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
