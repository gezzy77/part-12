Resolute action on personal, local, national, and global levels over the decades just passed might have staved off a future of economic contraction, political turmoil, and immense human suffering. Instead, governments and populations of all the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s industrial nations collectively closed their eyes to the impending crisis.\n\nNot The Future We Ordered is the first study of the psychological dimensions of that decision and its consequences, as a case study in the social psychology of collective failure, and as an issue with which psychologists and therapists will be confronted repeatedly in the years ahead. At the core of the modern worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inability to come to grips with the challenge of peak oil are a set of beliefs that amount to a civil religion of progress, in which the concept of progress is credited with the invincibility and beneficence other religions assign to their gods. This civil religion of progress lends legitimacy to policies that subordinate all other values to economic growth, place blind faith in untested technologies, and rule out serious consideration of the long-term downsides of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trends.\n\nThe religious faith in progress that makes such policies seem sensible, and provides justification for the marginalization of alternative views, has become one of the core factors driving contemporary societies headlong toward a wrenching confrontation with the hard limits of a finite planet. As the gap widens between todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations of perpetual progress and tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences, peak oil will become a significant mental health issue across the currently industrialized world. When Ã¢â‚¬Å“the future we orderedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ fails to show up on schedule, cognitive dissonance and other psychological impacts common in times of severe cultural dislocation will likely show up as well, driving counterproductive responses on the personal and collective scales. Understanding the psychology that backed industrial civilization into a corner called Ã¢â‚¬Å“peak oilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a crucial step in dealing with these consequences, and to this, Not The Future We Ordered offers a clear and readable guide\n\n160 pages\nPublisher: Karnac Books (February 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1780490887\nISBN-13: 978-1780490885","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938e24f6775e054e9368f781b1b3b56a89c41116","amp;dn":"Peak+Oil%2C+Psychology+%26amp%3B+Myth+of+Progress+%7C+John+Michael+Greer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938e24f6775e054e9368f781b1b3b56a89c41116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,142,36,246,119,94,5,78,147,104,247,129,177,179,181,106,137,196,17,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
