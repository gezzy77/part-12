Guys with abs live longer. Guys with abs don't worry about back pain. And, of course, guys with abs get lots of female attention. Unfortunately, you could spend years on starvation diets and extreme exercise programs that never unearth those elusive abdominal muscles. Or you could spend 6 weeks with Dave Zinczenko, editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, and lose up to 20 pounds--releasing a washboard stomach worthy of any woman's dreams. Sound impossible? Let Zinczenko prove it can be done. As editor of the most important men's magazine around, he has devoted his career to showing guys how they can lose their guts and pack on muscle. Now, in The Abs Diet, he reveals his infallible formula: l 6 weeks of guy-food menus, including meals, snacks, and a restaurant dining guide focusing on foods such as steak, chicken, cheese, and nuts l A workout program that anyone can master-emphasizing strength and interval training, with a special focus on lower-body workouts (the bigger the muscles you work, the faster the weight loss) l 12 'superfoods' that will change your life l A simple maintenance plan to keep your abs from disappearing. In just 6 weeks you can develop the superior strength and sexy symmetry every man--and woman!--lusts after. Let Men's Health show you how.\n\n\nBy David Zinczenko, Ted Spiker\nPublished by Rodale in 2004\nAZW3, Retail, 288 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168e8b58b85fc1623e4ee898d104d5ae527c0793","amp;dn":"The+Abs+Diet+%28AZW3%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168e8b58b85fc1623e4ee898d104d5ae527c0793","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,142,139,88,184,95,193,98,62,78,232,152,209,4,213,174,82,124,7,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
