The course is uniquely informed by the Cambridge Learner Corpus, using analysis of real IELTS candidate papers.\n\nThe 2 levels of Objective IELTS can be used on their own or consecutively, so that lower-level students requiring a high band score can start preparing early. Each level offers 60-80 hours of study, which can be extended using the Workbook and CD-ROM.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d63d3145513f21c6cfcde6069b1fdae1ed08edd","amp;dn":"Objective+IELTS+Cambridge+English+%28SB%2CWB%29%2B+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d63d3145513f21c6cfcde6069b1fdae1ed08edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,99,211,20,85,19,242,28,108,252,222,96,105,177,253,174,30,208,142,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
