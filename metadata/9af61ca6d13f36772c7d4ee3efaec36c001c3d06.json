These properties include high current density, ballistic transport, chemical inertness, high thermal conductivity, optical transmittance, and super hydrophobicity at nanometer scale.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to research on its excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties, research on the syntheses of a single sheet of graphene for industrial applications is in its nascent stages. Graphene: Synthesis and Applications reviews the advancement and future directions of graphene research in the areas of synthesis and properties, and explores applications, such as electronics, heat dissipation, field emission, sensors, composites, and energy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af61ca6d13f36772c7d4ee3efaec36c001c3d06","amp;dn":"Graphene+-+Synthesis+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af61ca6d13f36772c7d4ee3efaec36c001c3d06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,246,28,166,209,63,54,119,44,125,78,227,239,174,195,108,0,28,61,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
