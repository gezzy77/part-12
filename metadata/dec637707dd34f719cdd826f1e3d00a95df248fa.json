The delicate interplay between ChibiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and the ambiance created by Rainbow, M. Falcore, Rhim, Owen &amp; Nate is on full display. Dark new wave hooks and haunting synths turn sinister as Rainbow and FalcoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitars lead Hide and Seek into ever darker, ever more beautiful corners of The Birthday MassacreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec637707dd34f719cdd826f1e3d00a95df248fa","amp;dn":"The+Birthday+Massacre+-+Hide+and+Seek+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec637707dd34f719cdd826f1e3d00a95df248fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,198,55,112,125,211,79,113,156,221,130,111,30,61,0,169,93,242,72,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
