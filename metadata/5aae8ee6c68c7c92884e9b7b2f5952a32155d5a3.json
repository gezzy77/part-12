Now they've made the collective decision to follow the well-trodden path of millions of other civilizations; they are going to Sublime, elevating themselves to a new and almost infinitely more rich and complex existence.\n\nAmidst preparations though, the Regimental High Command is destroyed. Lieutenant Commander (reserve) Vyr Cossont appears to have been involved, and she is now wanted - dead, not alive. Aided only by an ancient, reconditioned android and a suspicious Culture avatar, Cossont must complete her last mission given to her by the High Command - find the oldest person in the Culture, a man over nine thousand years old, who might have some idea what really happened all that time ago. Cossont must discover the truth before she's exiled from her people and her civilization forever - or just plain killed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aae8ee6c68c7c92884e9b7b2f5952a32155d5a3","amp;dn":"The+Hydrogen+Sonata+-+Iain+M.+Banks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aae8ee6c68c7c92884e9b7b2f5952a32155d5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,174,142,230,198,140,124,146,136,78,155,123,47,89,82,163,33,85,213,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
