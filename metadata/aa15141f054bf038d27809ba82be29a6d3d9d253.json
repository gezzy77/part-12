After receiving mixed reviews for his 2006 record 'Rudebox', the former Take That man enlists the help of pioneering producer Trevor Horn, with electrifying results. Big and bold, it's a typical Robbie album. Packed with plenty of wit and humour, it's a storming return to form. Includes the single 'Bodies'.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa15141f054bf038d27809ba82be29a6d3d9d253","amp;dn":"Robbie+Williams+-+Reality+Killed+The+Video+Star+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa15141f054bf038d27809ba82be29a6d3d9d253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,21,20,31,5,75,240,56,210,120,9,186,130,190,41,166,211,217,210,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
