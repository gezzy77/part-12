It may not be perfect, \nbut I have labeled the year, artist, album, song title, \ngenre, track number, and album art to the best of my \nknowledge. When finished downloading, please continue\nto seed as much as is convenient.\n\nTorrent created January 18, 2013\n\nI am a huge fan of Adam's work and have tried to stay as \ntrue to his original material as possible. \n\nYou might notice that in the Sort Artist field, all of this music is tagged \n&quot;Adam Young&quot;. This is just to keep track of what music is his (since he has \nmusic under so many different monikers). Sorry the file is so big, but seriously, \nthis is everything.\n\nConcerning the unreleased Owl City tracks, a lot of it is stuff\nfrom his blog, but a ton of it also came from these awesome blogs.\n\n\nAnd feel free to check out my blog here:\n\n\nHere's the list of albums in this folder:\n\nMajor Projects:\n\nOwl City:\nOf June\nMaybe I'm Dreaming\nOcean Eyes (Deluxe Edition) \nTo the Sky - Single &quot;Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole&quot; Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\nPeppermint Winter - Single\nAll Things Bright and Beautiful (Bonus Track Version)\nThe Midsummer Station\nWhen Can I See You Again - Single &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; (Original Soundtrack)\nRare/Unreleased\nInstrumental Versions\nLive Performances\nAdam Young Remixes\nSpotify Sessions\n\nPort Blue:\nArctic\nThe Airship (Pre-Production)\nThe Airship\nThe Albatross EP (Pre-Production)\nThe Albatross EP\nThe Pacific EP\nB-Sides\nUnreleased\t\n\nSky Sailing:\nAn Airplane Carried Me to Bed\nAn Airplane Carried Me to Bed (Instrumental)\nSky Sailing Demos\n\nSwimming with Dolphins:\nAmbient Blue - EP\nWater Colours\nSingles\n\nWindsor Airlift:\nThe Basement EP\nThe Forest Sings to Distant Shores\t\nSelections for a Fallen Soldier, Vol. 2\nOcean City Park and Beneath the Crystal Waves\nHotels EP\nMoonfish Parachutist\nQui!\nFlight\nWe Rule!\nThe Meadow\nLive at the Varsity Theater\nUnknown Album\t\n\nMinor Projects:\nAmerican Jesus\nApes with Guns\nAquarium\nBasketball\nBeat Master Deluxe\nBlue Dallas\nBrother Reed, You Have Messed up My Afro\nCan You Smell What the Rock Is Cooking?\nCasey's Pizza\nCharlton Heston and the Blast Beats\nChester McWiggins and the Kowboy Kidz\nDolphin Park\nEl Uno Clarence, The One Clarence\nHalf Nelson Flying Corkscrew Clothesline\nInsect Airport\nIsle\nJoin the Dark Side, You Knob\nNovel\nNuclear Suplex\nRiders of Rohan\nSeagull Orchestra\nSlam Dance\nSlingshot Powerbomb\nSpinning Skull Smash\nSwimming with Dolphins\nThe Atlantic\nThe Grizzly\nThe Perfect Theory\nThe Sports\nThe Wellington Giggle-Bomb Experience\nTombstone Piledriver\nUnderstory\n\nFeatures:\nArmin Van Buuren: Youtopia\nChicane: Middledistancerunner\nToby Mac: The First Noel\nHe Is We: All About Us\nPaul Van Dyk: Eternity\n\nPlease send me a comment or PM if you have any information you think I could use or need help with anything.\nI hope you enjoy this collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b7d9f6ec06cded854e9240e2a9299e7ec221ea","amp;dn":"Adam+Young+Projects+-+Complete+%28AAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b7d9f6ec06cded854e9240e2a9299e7ec221ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,183,217,246,236,6,205,237,133,78,146,64,226,169,41,158,126,194,33,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
