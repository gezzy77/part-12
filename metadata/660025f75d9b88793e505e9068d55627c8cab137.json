Arkady Renko hits a sharp and complicated turn with the arrival of the KGBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pribluda. Suddenly, his access to a routine investigation is blocked. Why? And by whom?\n\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nGorky Park is a 1981 crime novel written by Martin Cruz Smith set in the Soviet Union.
