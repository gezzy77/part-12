The final scenes where the dead soldiers return to life are haunting and beautifully filmed, but earned the film a horror classification when released in the UK.\n\nGance felt compelled to make this film when he saw Europe drifting inexorably towards a second major conflict and reflected an oft-held view that political leaders, not ordinary men and women, cause wars. Needless to say, his words were not heeded and with the onset of war, the film was banned.\n\nSynopsis\nSickened by the experience of war, having served in the trenches during World War I, Jean Diaz dedicates his life to perfecting a machine that will prevent future wars. Although he thinks he has succeeded, his invention is used by the government as a weapon. In a last desperate measure of retaliation, Diaz conjures up the buried dead of World War I from their graves...\n\nCredits\n\n* Director: Abel Gance\n* script: Abel Gance, Steve Passeur\n* Photo: Roger Hubert\n* Music: Henri Verdun\n* Cast: Victor Francen (Jean Diaz), Line Noro (Edith), Marie Lou (Flo), Jean-Max (Henri Chimay), Paul Amiot (Captain), Jean-Louis Barrault, Marcel DelaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®tre (FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Laurin), RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Devillers (Helene), Romuald JoubÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (Jean Diaz), AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Nox (Leotard), Georges Rollin (Pierre Fonds), Georges Saillard (Giles Tenant)\n* Country: France\n* Language: French\n* Runtime: 104 min; B&amp;W\n* Aka: I Accuse; That They May Live","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb4cc80f95677d7e30c35f26d18b7e6f2b0578c","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%2811%29+J%5C%27ACCUSE+%281938%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb4cc80f95677d7e30c35f26d18b7e6f2b0578c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,180,204,128,249,86,119,215,227,12,53,242,109,24,183,230,242,176,87,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
