Short and beautifully written, it has inspired generations of readers, intellectuals and policy makers. One of the most important books on the social sciences since the Second World War, it is a searing insight into the ideas of this great thinker.\n\n2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba7d742199e34bddf9c068c5d682c4302012b26","amp;dn":"The+Poverty+of+Historicism+%28Popper%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba7d742199e34bddf9c068c5d682c4302012b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,167,215,66,25,158,52,189,223,156,6,140,93,104,44,67,2,1,43,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
