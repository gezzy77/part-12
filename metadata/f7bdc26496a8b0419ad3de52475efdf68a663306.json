It took me some hours and internet connection but now here for you! Enjoy! \r\n\r\nFrom official KE web site:\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Official&quot; Keith Emerson Tribute Concert will be held Saturday, May 28, at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. It will be a retrospective of Keith's entire career from the Nice, to ELP, to the Keith Emerson Band and Three Fates Project. Many of the artists who were close friends and have worked with Keith will be performing some of his most famous works. \r\n\r\nIt promises to be a great night of music and homage to one of the most influential musicians and composers of the twentieth century. \r\n\r\nFeaturing Performances by:\r\n \t \r\nThe Brian Auger Band\tThe Keith Emerson Band\r\nEddie Jobson (U.K. / Roxy Music)\tMarc Bonilla (Keith Emerson Band / Toy Matinee)\r\nJordan Rudess (Dream Theater)\tTroy Luccketta (Tesla, Three Fates Project)\r\nSteve Porcaro (Toto)\tJoe Travers (Zappa's Universe)\r\nCJ Vanston (Spinal Tap)\tTravis Davis (Keith Emerson Band)\r\nSteve Lukather (Toto)\tMick Mahan (Pat Benatar)\r\nPhilippe Saisse (Al Dimeola)\tEd Roth (Boys Club, CTA)\r\nGregg Bissonette (Ringo Starr)\tMike Wallace (Boys Club / Dragonchoir)\r\nVinnie Colaiuta (Jeff Beck, Frank Zappa)\tJonathan Sindelman (Alan White Band)\r\nJeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter (Steely Dan / Doobie Bros.)\tRachel Flowers\r\nRick Livingstone\tMaestro Terje Mikkelsen (Three Fates Project)\r\n \t \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKarn Evil 9 First Impression\r\ndi Cal Vid\r\n9:30\r\n\r\nThe Barbarian ft.
