It was her second platinum album of the 1980s and eventually did better than any other full album she issued in the decade, except for Diana (1980). It also started Ross on a run of youthful hits that would include &quot;Work That Body,&quot; &quot;Mirror, Mirror,&quot; and the ultimate vanity song, &quot;Muscles.&quot; \n\nWikipedia bio:\n&quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; is a 1981 album released by American singer Diana Ross on the RCA label (EMI-Capitol in Europe). It was the first album she recorded without Motown Records, having left the label earlier that year to sign a $20 million dollar deal with RCA. The album was also the first to be produced by the singer, which became her second RIAA-certified platinum album after &quot;diana&quot; (1980). Among the hits included on the album are the title track (US #7, UK #4), the rock-flavored &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; (US #8) and the '80s-aerobics-craze inspired, &quot;Work That Body&quot; (UK #5). A solo version of Ross' Lionel Richie duet, &quot;Endless Love&quot;, is also featured.\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nWhy Do Fools Fall In Love\n=========================\n\n01. Why Do Fools Fall In Love  \n02.
