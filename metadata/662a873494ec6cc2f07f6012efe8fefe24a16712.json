Build cities, manage economies and \nbattle pirates in the Middle Ages. Grow your small towne into a major trading center wielding tremendous economic power.\nReview:\nAll you really need to know about Ascaron's latest installment in its flagship franchise is \nthat Patrician III was released in the company's home of Germany as an add-on, not a new product. There are a few new weather effects, \nminor changes in the interface, a map editor, and some gameplay tweaks, including differently priced goods and a bit \nmore control over your city when you become the mayor.\n\nYou start the game in one of the cities of the Hanseatic League (a loose trade federation of free cities in Northern Europe) \nwith a ship or two and a few thousand coins. Through wise investments and trading, you can establish a mercantile empire and \nrise in rank, as well as eventually become the lord of your home city.\n\nThere's an almost Zen-like quality to the trading. Though prices will vary according to supply and demand, you \nwill probably be trading the same goods in the same cities over and over. This repetitive mindlessness will lull you into a near meditative state.\n\nThings get more interesting after you accumulate a war chest. With capital, you can build businesses, \nbecome a pirate, and eventually rise to power as a politician and the executive of your city. There are many goals \nto pursue and even more ways to go about pursuing them. This freedom is the game's greatest strengthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½assuming you like \nopen-ended games. If you want narrative, though, Patrician III won't do much for you. The missions are generic, and the \nfew included scenarios simply change your victory conditions.\n\nFor those who have recently discovered a fetish for medieval cogs \nand selling barrels of pickled herring, there is no game better than \nPatrician III. But if you've played its predecessors, there's no pressing reason to run out and buy this game at full price.\n\nInstallation:\n1) Mount the ISO file\n2) Install\n3) Play :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662a873494ec6cc2f07f6012efe8fefe24a16712","amp;dn":"Patrician+3%3A+Rise+of+the+Hanse+%5BPL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662a873494ec6cc2f07f6012efe8fefe24a16712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,42,135,52,148,236,108,194,240,127,96,18,239,232,254,254,36,161,103,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
