Somewhat lost in the shuffle, this excellent quartet session with clarinetist Bill Smith, Chris Brubeck (on electric bass and bass trombone) and drummer Randy Jones finds the pianist/leader performing eight of his compositions; only &quot;Blues for Newport&quot; caught on a little.  The emphasis is on slower tempos and wistful solos ( particularly on the Paul Desmond-tribute &quot;We Will All Remember Paul&quot; ) but the music is stimulating enough to hold one's interest throughout.  Dave Brubeck has never allowed himself to become predictable. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nDave Brubeck - Reflections Tracks:\n01  Reflections of You\n02  A Misty Morning \n03  I'd Walk a Country Mile \n04  My One Bad Habit\n05  Blues for Newport\n06  We Will Remember Paul \n07  Michael, My Second Son\n08  Blue Lake Tahoe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8ff0a1e440bfdbf5ddcfa861d4e5ddc317addf","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+Reflections+%281985%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8ff0a1e440bfdbf5ddcfa861d4e5ddc317addf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,143,240,161,228,64,191,219,245,221,207,168,97,212,229,221,195,23,173,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
