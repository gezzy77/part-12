As Yet Untitled\n11. Who's Loving You\n\n\nIn this debut album Terence Trent D'Arby put together one of the greatest soul albums since the peak of classic Motown. From the opening, gospel-tinged, If You All Get To Heaven, through the closing cover of the legendary Smokey Robinson Who's Lovin' You, D'Arby composed a record strong enough to warrant comparisons to the all time soul legends. The album reaches a peak amongst peaks in the 1988 radio hit Sign Your Name, that will forever be a staple of easy listening radio. This album would be D'Arby's creative and commercial peak, never again to be matched by his later efforts.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 18\nArtist: Terence Trent D'Arby\nAlbum: Introducing The Hardline According To Terence Trent D'Arby\nYear: 1987\nGenre: Soul\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b69aefc1934a18fe805271cf97fb4bad754bcf","amp;dn":"Terence+Trent+D%5C%27Arby+-+Introducing+The...%5BFLAC-1987%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b69aefc1934a18fe805271cf97fb4bad754bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,182,154,239,193,147,74,24,254,128,82,113,207,151,251,75,173,117,75,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
