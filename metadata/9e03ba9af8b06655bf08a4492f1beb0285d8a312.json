It is the only major-label-distributed title that has the modern Tommy Boy Records logo on it.\n\nI don&amp;#039;t care what the critics say. This follow up to their debut album is excellent. I did not even know it existed until a few years ago. \n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. &quot;Seek 200&quot;\n2. &quot;How Long&quot;\n3. &quot;Think&quot;\n4. &quot;A Knife &amp; A Fork&quot;\n5. &quot;Now That I Have You&quot;\n6. &quot;Fire Tonight&quot;\n7. &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Slow Down&quot;\n8. &quot;Hard Currency&quot;\n9. &quot;Move Out&quot;\n10. &quot;Mirrorshades&quot;\n11. &quot;Hack 1&quot;\n12. &quot;If Only&quot;\n13. &quot;Come With Me&quot;\n14. &quot;Slipping Away&quot;\n15. &quot;Chemistry&quot;\n\nPerfectly tagged with artwork. Just dump it into iTunes.
