The King's Guard captures her, and she finds herself in the same cell with Peter Goodwin, a nobleman - who pretends to be a robber like her, to flirt with her. After her evasion, Mary goes up the ladder in her criminal life - becoming a good pirate under captain Poof. When the captain dies, the only 'man' aboard who is respected by every faction among the pirates is... Mary. She represents a menace to the Florida Governor, who invites a nobleman to lead the King's naval forces against the pirates: Peter Goodwin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1496b8265a30f7e9faeb92b922fabb6cd8881d72","amp;dn":"Le+avventure+di+Mary+Read+%2F+Mary+la+rousse%2C+femme+pirate+%281961%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1496b8265a30f7e9faeb92b922fabb6cd8881d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,150,184,38,90,48,247,233,250,235,146,185,34,250,187,108,216,136,29,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
