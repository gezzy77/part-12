But whereas the svelte chanteuse makes music that suggests upper-crust, non-smoking jazz clubs, Sweetback&amp;#039;s music is more &quot;underground&quot; in tone. Guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman, keyboardist Andrew Hale, and bassist Paul Spencer Denman are definitely out to forge an identity of their own. They describe their music as &quot;global soul music.&quot; It&amp;#039;s a diverse mixture of ambient dub, trip-hop, retro soul, and slightly off-kilter jazz. They have a versatile group of guest performers to help them get their musical vision across. On the first single, the smooth &quot;You Will Rise,&quot; Groove Theory vocalist Amel Larrieux caresses the optimistic lyrics: &quot;I got a story that must be heard/about a little girl who wished she was a bird/she was unhappy living in a ghetto cage/but it gave her hope when her sweet grandma would say/baby you will rise.&quot;Maxwell, whom the band backed on some of the tracks from his Maxwell&amp;#039;s Urban Hang Suite, croons softly on &quot;Softly Softly.&quot; Vocalist Leroy Osbourne gives Bill Withers&amp;#039; &quot;Hope She&amp;#039;ll Be Happier&quot; a tender reading.Some of the instrumental tracks sound like film scores. While others, on first listen, may have you expecting to hear Sade&amp;#039;s vocals come in. &quot;Walk of Ju&quot; would fit well in an introspective scene perhaps by an ocean with billowing waves. &quot;Come Dubbing&quot; is both goofy fun and lushly romantic. &quot;Cloud People&quot; is a perfect progressive lite jazz with its light rhythmic synth textures, noodling acoustic and Fender Rhodes pianos, and lazy sax runs. If you&amp;#039;re looking for music to relax to, Sweetback is the right album to kick back with. \n\nPersonnel:\nStuart Matthewman - Saxophone, Guitar\nAndrew Hale - Keyboards\nPaul S.
