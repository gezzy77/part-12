The highly anticipate third album from the Melbourne-based singer-songwriter is a typically heartfelt and genuine offering of down-tempo indie rock. Each song is meticulously crafted and carefully arranged, with GreenwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understated singing voice and talent for writing meaningful lyrics the real centrepiece of the record.\n\nIn the past few years, various tracks have been included in soundtracks ranging from local TV shows (Packed to the Rafters), Hollywood TV shows (One Tree Hill) and even videogames (Pro Evolution Soccer). Perhaps itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this newfound fame and notoriety that led to such a lengthy hiatus, and Greenwood was quoted at the time of saying that the reason for doing so was Ã¢â‚¬Å“really complex, but to sum it up: I just need to try something different, musicallyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Whatever the reason behind it, his sabbatical in London has proved fruitful, with his latest album being his strongest so far.\n\nWhitley has achieved a solid balance between interesting instrumental lines and engaging lyrical and vocal efforts. Album opener The Ballad of Terrence McKenna is a dark and philosophical song, with WhitleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice joined by a cautiously plucked guitar and a vague and ambient backing track, as he sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“In a moment itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone / but this whole life feels so wrong.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These themes of displacement and emptiness are pervasive throughout the album. The final track of the album, I Am Not a Rock, is another pensive and deeply personal track, with Whitley again exploring Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfound soundsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in his use of percussion and guitar. Although the tone of the album rarely shifts from introspective and moody, there are almost imperceptible changes in tone as Whitley explores various ideas through his lyrics, giving the album great potential for repeat listening Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely a record that requires several spins to really get to terms with the writing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c4a352d3d8f7374abc718167d95a4ae4f55a51","amp;dn":"Whitley+-+Even+The+Stars+Are+A+Mess+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c4a352d3d8f7374abc718167d95a4ae4f55a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,196,163,82,211,216,247,55,74,188,113,129,103,217,90,74,228,245,90,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
