On March 18, the band posted a promotional video for an upcoming tour with a new song titled &quot;Here to Die&quot;.\nOn May 1, 2013, the band announced that they would be releasing two studio albums in the year, with The Wrong Side of Heaven and the Righteous Side of Hell, Volume 1 being released on July 30, and Volume 2 following on November 19. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory said of the band's decision to release two albums:\n&quot;We came off the road after a couple of great years of touring and were really amped up to write the 4th record. Everybody was in the right headspace and the band tighter than ever so it was a perfect storm. We jumped in head first and found ourselves 12-13 songs deep fairly quick but were still coming up with better and better material so we looked at each other and said... okay why stop there?... letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keep going. Once we passed the 24th song we knew weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to do a double album. We had this massive amount of music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very dear to us, possibly the best material this band has ever created. At that point there was no way to decide which songs to leave off the album. So we made the decision to release them all.&quot;\n\n\n00 album art 01.JPG\t                                                   84.98 KB\n01 Here To Die.flac 44.1kHz 1091kbps\t                                   23.53 MB\n02 Weight Beneath My Sin.flac 44.1kHz 1046kbps \t                           27.15 MB\n03 Wrecking Ball.flac 44.1kHz 1031kbps\t                                   23.88 MB\n04 Battle Born.flac 44.1kHz 1029kbps\t                                   27.55 MB\n05 Cradle To The Grave.flac 44.1kHz 1059kbps\t                           25.16 MB\n06 Matter Of Time.flac 44.1kHz 1097kbps\t                                   25.74 MB\n07 The Agony Of Regret.flac 44.1kHz 738kbps\t                            9.15 MB\n08 Cold.flac 44.1kHz 942kbps\t                                           25.69 MB\n09 Let This Go.flac 44.1kHz 1092kbps\t                                   25.69 MB\n10 My Heart Lied.flac 44.1kHz 1058kbps\t                                   27.24 MB\n11 A Day In My Life.flac 44.1kHz 1088kbps\t                           29.20 MB\n12 The House Of The Rising Sun.flac 44.1kHz 995kbps\t                   29.44 MB\nFive Finger Death Punch - The Wrong Side Of Heaven And The Righteous Side Of Hell Volume 2.m3u\t                                                          967 bytes\nThe Wrong Side Of Heaven And The Righteous Side Of Hell Volume 2.cue\t    1.43 KB\nz. audiochecker main log file.log\t                                    3.48 KB\nz.audiochecker.log\t                                                  876 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3aadf5a400304c11ef4ffc830bb6efee84e5a39","amp;dn":"Five+Finger+Death+Punch+-+The+Wrong+Side+Of+Heaven+And+The+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3aadf5a400304c11ef4ffc830bb6efee84e5a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,170,223,90,64,3,4,193,30,244,255,200,48,187,110,254,232,78,90,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
