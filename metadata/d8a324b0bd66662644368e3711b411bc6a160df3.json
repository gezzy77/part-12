Each chapter focuses on a target organ system, begins with a clinical case, and incorporates cell biology, biochemistry, physiology, and pathophysiology to explain how and why different drug classes are effective for diseases in that organ system.\n\nOver 400 two-color illustrations show molecular, cellular, biochemical, and pathophysiologic processes underlying diseases and depict targets of drug therapy. Each Second Edition chapter includes a drug summary table presenting mechanism, clinical applications, adverse effects, contraindications, and therapeutic considerations. New chapters explain how drugs produce adverse effects and describe the life cycle of drug development.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a324b0bd66662644368e3711b411bc6a160df3","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Pharmacology%3A+The+Pathophysiologic+Basis+of+Drug+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a324b0bd66662644368e3711b411bc6a160df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,163,36,176,189,102,102,38,68,54,142,55,17,180,17,188,106,22,13,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
