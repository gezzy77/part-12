Many people also simply accept without question the claim by others that the Bible is full of contradictions. Even more disturbing is that a growing number of Christians are unable to respond when presented with an apparent inconsistency in the Bible.\n\nNow in a bold defense for the accuracy of Scripture, Ken Ham leads a powerful team of contributors in providing core biblical truths to help refute claims regarding the inaccuracy of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Holy Word. Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions:\n\n-Addresses over 40 issues of contention in the Old and New Testaments including Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Matthew, John, Acts, and Revelation\n-Contains vital and relevant context by Steve Fazekas, Bodie Hodge, Roger Patterson, Stacia McKeever, Gary Vaterlaus, Dr. Jason Lisle, Paul F. Taylor, John Upchurch, and Dr. Georgia Purdom\n-Equips you to accurately defend your faith while challenging secular or humanistic agendas\n\nWith nearly two-thirds of young people leaving the Church when they move from home, there has never been a more important time to have a reasoned response for those who desire only to undermine your faith. This book is a great starting point in teaching you how to think and then respond to false claims regarding the Bible. It is imperative that believers are able to stand firm in their faith, and have answers to the cultureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attacks on the Bible.\n\n\nDemolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions, Volume 2\nThe Bible is accurate and without error! Demolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions Volume 2 offers 40 powerful explanations to prove it.\n\nThere is an increasing focus in our culture on dismissing the Bible and its authority. Generations of skeptics and the religion of evolution have influenced even some Christian leaders. By highlighting supposed errors or inconsistencies in the Bible, doubt is created in the minds of believers and stumbling blocks are put up for those trying to present the Gospel. But Biblical evidence disproves the toughest of critics while bringing to light the indestructible power of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Word. Tim Chaffey, Ken Ham, and Bodie Hodge of Answers in Genesis highlight the answers to these debates and more:\n\n-Is all Scripture inspired by God, or is some of it the opinion of the writers of Scripture?\n-After His resurrection, did Jesus first appear to the eleven disciples on a mountain in Galilee or in Jerusalem behind closed doors?\n-Can God be tempted?\n-Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Christians follow all the Old Testament laws?\n\nDemolishing Supposed Bible Contradictions Volumes 1 and 2 are must-have references for every believer who wants to have an answer to give to those who ask a reason for their hope (1 Peter 3:15). Join the battle armed with the sword of Spirit, the truth that will defeat the lies aimed for this generation and those to follow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b41b1288d6b99e272221ef4be2c179c55d624f","amp;dn":"Demolishing+Supposed+Bible+Contradictions%2C+Vol.1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b41b1288d6b99e272221ef4be2c179c55d624f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,180,27,18,136,214,185,158,39,34,33,239,75,226,193,121,197,93,98,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
