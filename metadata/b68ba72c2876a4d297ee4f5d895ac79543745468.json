It was the band's last album for the Hollywood label, as they moved to Side One Dummy Records the following year. It was also their last album with longtime bassist Royce Nunley, who left the group in 2002. The album's musical direction mixes the pop punk  style the band had explored on their previous album The Suicide Machines with elements of the ska punk and hardcore  styles of their first two albums.\n\n*Track #4 (originally performed by R.E.M.)\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n1. &quot;The Killing Blow&quot;                3:04\n2. &quot;Steal This Record&quot;               4:08\n3. &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot;             2:46\n*4. &quot;It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot;   3:18\n5. &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot;                  3:41\n6. &quot;The Air We Breathe&quot;              2:53\n7. &quot;Stand Up&quot;                        3:29\n8. &quot;Off the Cuff&quot;                    1:36\n9. &quot;Middle Way&quot;                      3:00\n10. &quot;Scars&quot;                          2:26\n11. &quot;All My People&quot;                  1:42\n12. &quot;Unbreakable&quot;                    2:27   \n13. &quot;Stay&quot;                           2:31\n14. &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;                  2:53\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68ba72c2876a4d297ee4f5d895ac79543745468","amp;dn":"The+Suicide+Machines+-+Steal+This+Record","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68ba72c2876a4d297ee4f5d895ac79543745468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,139,167,44,40,118,164,210,151,238,79,93,137,90,199,149,67,116,84,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
