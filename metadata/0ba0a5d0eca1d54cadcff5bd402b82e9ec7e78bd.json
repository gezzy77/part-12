It had never occurred to me to try it myself and it was a satisfying relief when I did. I write musical ideas all the time and writing this record felt as natural as breathing. This record was very timely in my life as well. My daughter was just an infant as I wrote this material and I was still meditating on my father's passing. The music fit the mood of the Mississippi winter of 2009.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba0a5d0eca1d54cadcff5bd402b82e9ec7e78bd","amp;dn":"Luther+Dickinson+-+Hambone%27s+Meditations+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba0a5d0eca1d54cadcff5bd402b82e9ec7e78bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,160,165,208,236,161,213,76,173,207,245,189,64,43,130,233,236,126,120,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
