It was released by RCA Records in February 1974.\n\nThe title track, Jolene, tells the tale of a housewife confronting a beautiful seductress who she believes is having an affair with her husband. It became Parton's second solo number-one country single, it also was a moderate pop hit for her, and also did well in the United Kingdom. It has been covered by numerous performers.\n\nThe album was released around the time Parton was embarking on a solo career, after having spent seven years as part of Porter Wagoner's weekly TV series and road show, and one of the album's songs, I Will Always Love You, was reportedly written to express the remorse Parton felt over the professional breakup. Released as the album's second single, it also became a number-one country single. In 1992, Whitney Houston's version of I Will Always Love You was a mega-hit pop ballad.
