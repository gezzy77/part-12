These units have details that are normally reserved for games with only a few active units. Huge, kilometer-long Dreadnoughts can have a half dozen turrets, each with their own firing solutions. Smaller units will intelligently target units based on true line of sight physics. That's right, every unit's vision is based on line of sight, instead of radial fog of war. \r\n\r\nWhile Ashes has a strong multiplayer feature set, it includes what is arguably the most sophisticated AI engine ever devised for a real-time strategy game. Ashes of the Singularity requires a minimum of 4-cores on your CPU. In exchange, players get an AI that can create complex strategies that can play by the same rules as you do providing a level of challenge never before seen in a single player RTS. \r\n\r\nCompete in ranked games against strangers or set up custom, un-ranked competitive or cooperative games with friends. A worldwide ranking system lets players find where they stand in comparison to other players. \r\n\r\nGames are won or lost based on your strategy not how fast you can click. Deciding what technologies to research, where to send armies, managing your economy, determining what units to construct are critical for victory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc72119fadceda362183170d9085b90a2c14c54f","amp;dn":"Ashes+of+the+Singularity+v.0.60","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc72119fadceda362183170d9085b90a2c14c54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,114,17,159,173,206,218,54,33,131,23,13,144,133,185,10,44,20,197,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
