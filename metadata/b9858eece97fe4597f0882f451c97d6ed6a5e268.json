Or at least they become so in the mind of the film's genially swashbuckling protagonist.\n\nAdapted from an early-19th-century novel by the Polish author Jan Potocki, and set at the end of the Napoleonic era, the movie follows the travels of Capt. Alphonse van Worden (Zbigniew Cybulski), a Belgian military officer who is making a cross-European trip to Madrid but keeps getting sidetracked.\n\nThe story begins in the heat of battle as Alphonse, who has fled to a cabin, is mysteriously attracted to a manuscript whose pictures are so compelling he barely notices when enemy soldiers arrive to arrest him.\n\nWhen these soldiers become as entranced as Alphonse by the manuscript, especially by a drawing of two beautiful princesses, the film dissolves into an &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;-like journey in which Alphonse lives out the book's magical, picaresque adventures. They unfold as a series of dreams from which Alphonse periodically awakes to find himself wounded on a battlefield heaped with skulls beside a gallows on which two executed prisoners still hang.\n\nFleeing, he meets two sisters, the princesses Emina (Iga Cembrzynskza) and Zibelda (Joanna Jedryka), who subject him to a series of tests of his worthiness to marry them. These trials suggest a goofy, sprawling, all-purpose allegory so overstuffed with symbolism that it plays as a kind of epic spoof of the form.\n\nIf Alphonse's soldierly adventures on behalf of the princesses have the aura of satanic temptations, the voluptuous attractions thrown in his path appear to be a mishmash of Islamic and Christian imagery without a clear-cut moral agenda.\n\nThe film's central skein of interlocking tales focuses on a hermit priest, later revealed as a sheik (Kazierz Opalinksi), and his howling one-eyed assistant, Pacheco (Franciszek Pieczka), who at first seems to be possessed by demons but who may be faking. As Pacheco tells his life story, it spins off into a cycle of monologues with one character after another becoming the chief storyteller relating fantastic tales of sexual intrigue, skulduggery and Faustian bargaining.\n\nThe movie is really an extended jokey meditation on reality and illusion, in a self-mocking comic style that keeps emotion at arm's length. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard01-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard02-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard03-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard04-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard04-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i768.photobucket.com/albums/xx323/little_itty_bitty/Clipboard05-2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------my rip-------\n\n~~~~~~ Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossie.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................2,056,114,176                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:55:05                \nFrame Count:....................................262621             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................320                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.200                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1428                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.254&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
