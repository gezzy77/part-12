Tocqueville examines the structures, institutions and operation of democracy, and shows how Europe can learn from American success and failures. His central theme is the advancement of the rule of the people, but he also predicts that slavery will bring about the &quot;most horrible of civil wars&quot;, foresees that the USA and Russia will be the superpowers of the twentieth century, and is 150 years ahead of his time in his views on the position and importance of women.\n\nNote: Reeve's translation is antiquated and was criticized by Tocqueville himself. Nevertheless, it is the only professionally-produced audiobook version currently (2013) available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8e8ed053d2419cdd8422e48fc06c4234b2528a2","amp;dn":"Democracy+in+America+%28Tocqueville+1835%2C+unabridged+audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8e8ed053d2419cdd8422e48fc06c4234b2528a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,232,237,5,61,36,25,205,216,66,46,72,252,6,196,35,75,37,40,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
