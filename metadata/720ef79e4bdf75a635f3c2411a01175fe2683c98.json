Here, the mutant population doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sport GQ-style or champagne dreams. They eke out each day in squalid tenement rows and filthy streets where only one man and one law can be trusted: the X-Man Bishop. Something lives under District X, something that loves the darkÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leaving a trail of murders in its wake. In a world thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rarely black-and-white, can the X-Man called Bishop and his partner Ismael make the right calls that save peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives? Or will they be helpless against this predator under the streets?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720ef79e4bdf75a635f3c2411a01175fe2683c98","amp;dn":"District+X+%2801+-+14+%26amp%3B+Tie-ins%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720ef79e4bdf75a635f3c2411a01175fe2683c98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,14,247,158,75,223,117,166,53,243,194,65,26,1,23,95,226,104,60,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
