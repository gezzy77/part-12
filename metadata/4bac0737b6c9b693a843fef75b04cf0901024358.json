Defect which can be seen partly as an asset if we consider the Finardi want to change and try new ways, experimenting with genres such as calypso in &quot; 15 Bambini &quot; , the reggae &quot; Legalizzatela ,&quot; the tribal rhythms of &quot; Lasciati andare &quot;, etc. .\nA hard transition across two albums beautiful but extremely distant as &quot;Blitz &quot; and &quot; Finardi.&quot;\nFrom this disc are extrapolated two singles : &quot;15 bambini / La canzone dell'acqua &quot; and &quot;Why love / Song fly high &quot;, also just with the song &quot; 15 Bambini &quot; participate in the Festivalbar 1979.\nIn this work there is the irony of the song led to Festivalbar, there are traces of the difficult historical period of time, of change, of the difficulty of presenting and doing concerts in a certain way , the social and &quot; Zerbo &quot; ne is the witness . There are the sweet songs like &quot;Why love&quot; .\nThere are the feelings of several years ago that sometimes coincide with those of today. In &quot; Paura ,&quot; we see the cyclical nature of the situation, as already in 1979 Finardi singing &quot; And I'm afraid to go out at night. And I'm afraid . Life is getting tougher.&quot;\n&quot;La canzone dell'acqua&quot; is definitely one of the best tracks of Eugenio and his sweet mood here this is what we find more and more often in later records. &quot; Lasciati andare&quot; is simple but effective in his attempt to make us shake off any thought into a hypnotic mantra flavor .\nThoughts turned to the social return to &quot; Legalizzatela .&quot; The second song in English, &quot;Song fly high &quot; is a rock where you can breathe America and its roots . Closes &quot; Ridendo scherzando, a&quot; fun, which is hummed the &quot; Roccando Rollando, laughing joking, Roccando roccando and we are helping&quot; that gives the title to the disc.\n\nAfter this work Finardi left Milan and its social tensions , with which it probably was not able to live and move in Carimate .\nLast note for the original cover, which photomontage even after many years , and continues to appear particularly ironic.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bac0737b6c9b693a843fef75b04cf0901024358","amp;dn":"Eugenio+Fnardi+-+Roccando+Rollando%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bac0737b6c9b693a843fef75b04cf0901024358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,172,7,55,182,201,182,147,168,67,254,247,91,4,207,9,1,2,67,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
