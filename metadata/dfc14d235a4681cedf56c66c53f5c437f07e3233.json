Always at the forefront, ScheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company created the first DC cartoons with Superman, Batman, and Aquaman, ruled the song charts with The Archies, kept Trekkie hope alive with the Emmy-winning Star Trek: The Animated Series, taught morals with Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, and swung into high adventure with Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, and Zorro. Forays into live-action included Shazam! and The Secrets of Isis, plus ground-breaking special effects work on Jason of Star Command and others. And in the 1980s, Filmation single-handedly caused the syndication explosion with He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and its successors. Now, with best-selling co-author Andy Mangels, Lou Scheimer tells the entire story, including how his father decked Adolf Hitler, memories of the comic books of the Golden Age, schooling with Andy Warhol, and what it meant to lead the last all-American animation company through nearly thirty years of innovation and fun! Profusely illustrated with photos, model sheets, storyboards, presentation art, looks at rare and unproduced series, and more plus hundreds of tales about Filmation s past, and rare Filmation-related art by Bruce Timm, Adam Hughes, Alex Ross, Phil Jimenez, Frank Cho, Gene Ha, and Mike McKone this book shows the Filmation Generation the story behind the stories!\n\n\n\nLou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation By Lou Scheimer, Andy Mangels\n2012 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 160549044X | scanned PDF | 222 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc14d235a4681cedf56c66c53f5c437f07e3233","amp;dn":"Creating.the.Filmation.Generation.By.Lou+Scheimer.Andy.Mangels.B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc14d235a4681cedf56c66c53f5c437f07e3233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,193,77,35,90,70,129,206,223,86,198,108,83,245,196,55,240,126,50,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
