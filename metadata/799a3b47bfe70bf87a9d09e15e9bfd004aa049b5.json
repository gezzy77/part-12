The Phantom Carriage, The Phantom Chariot, The Stroke of Midnight, and Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness), 1921 \n\nDirector: Victor SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m\nWriters: Selma LagerlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶f (novel), Victor SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m (writer)\n\nRelease Date: 1 January 1922 (UK)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012364&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012364&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLegend says that whoever is the last person to die on New Year?s Eve will be destined to drive the Phantom Carriage, collecting dead souls for a year. When a drunkard is found at the stroke of midnight, the victim of a vicious fight, he is forced to relive his past to see how he and those around him have been destroyed by his selfish and destructive ways. \n\nThe Phantom Carriage is a classic supernatural tale by master film-maker Victor SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m, and was the inspiration for Ingmar Bergman?s career as a director (Bergman actually later cast SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m in Wild Strawberries). Made in 1920, it remains as a mesmerising and extraordinary film with still-outstanding special photo-effects and dramatic camerawork. \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Phantom Carriage (KTL Edition)\n\nThe KTL Edition features an atmospheric and evocative new score written and recorded by KTL, the unique sonic collaboration between Stephen O?Malley [SunnO)))] and Peter Rehberg [aka Pita], who have previously worked together soundtracking the bizarre theatrical production of Dennis Cooper?s ?Kindertotenlieder?.
