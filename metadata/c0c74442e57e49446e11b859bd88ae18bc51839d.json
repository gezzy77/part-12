Reinhardt is often regarded as one of the greatest guitar players of all time and was the first important European jazz musician who made major contributions to the development of the genre. After his third and fourth fingers were paralyzed when he suffered burns in a fire, Reinhardt used only the index and middle fingers of his left hand on his solos and invented an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar) that has since become a living musical tradition within French Gypsy culture. With violinist StÃƒÂ©phane Grappelli, he co-founded the Quintette du Hot Club de France, described by critic Thom Jurek as &quot;one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz.&quot;[4] Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become jazz standards, including &quot;Minor Swing&quot;, &quot;Daphne&quot;, &quot;Belleville&quot;, &quot;Djangology&quot;, &quot;Swing '42&quot;, and &quot;Nuages&quot;.\n\n&quot;Nuages&quot; is one of the best-known compositions by Django Reinhardt. He recorded at least thirteen versions of the song, which is a jazz standard and a mainstay of the gypsy swing repertoire. English and French lyrics have been added to the originally instrumental piece. The title translates in English as &quot;Clouds&quot;; though the English lyric adaptation is titled &quot;It's the Bluest Kind of Blues&quot;. Reinhardt's 1946 recording (as can be heard in the sample to the right) is in the key of G major.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1 I Got Rhythm 2:30\n2 Crazy Rhythm 3:09\n3 My Melancholy Baby 3:22\n4 Jasper Creepers 3:15\n5 Sweet Georgia Brown 3:10\n6 Honeysuckle Rose 2:56\n7 Liza 2:54\n8 Nuages 3:18\n9 Nuits de Saint Germain de Pres 3:10\n10 Just One of Those Things 2:51\n11 I Cover the Waterfront 2:42\n12 I Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight 3:10 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c74442e57e49446e11b859bd88ae18bc51839d","amp;dn":"Django+Reinhardt+-+Nuages+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c74442e57e49446e11b859bd88ae18bc51839d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,199,68,66,229,126,73,68,110,17,184,89,189,136,174,24,188,81,131,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
