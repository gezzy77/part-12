After almost a decade since the publication of the first edition, this book considers new risk management methodologies, approaches and packages.\n\nBringing together a wide variety of statistical methods and models that have proven their worth in risk management, Market Risk Modelling provides practical examples and easily implementable approaches, whereby readers can integrate the underlying quantitative concepts into their pre-existing risk management systems.\n\nWritten by market risk expert, Nigel Da Costa Lewis, this second edition gives concise and applied explanations of approaches to market risk modelling, demonstrated using relevant, applicable examples. Designed for the time-starved risk manager as both a working manual and a compact reference guide, this book provides rapid and succinct access to what can be an intimidating and complex subject.\n\nThe value of market risk statistical analysis in resource and performance evaluation and setting trading limits is long-established. Statistical methods provide an objective assessment of the risks facing a financial institution and, as importantly, offer their potential clients a fully transparent risk profile of products and services. Market Risk Modelling, Second Edition covers the topics key to risk modelling and management, such as EVT, principle components and fitting probability distributions.\n\nA quickly digestible reference to this rapidly evolving field, Market Risk Modelling, Second Edition is a must read for all risk management professionals and quants who need practical and applicable insight into this vitally important subject.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface\n\n1  Risk Modelling and its Myths\n\n2  Mastering the R Statistical Package\n\nGetting Started in R\nHow to Create and Manipulate Objects\nManaging your R Workspace\nWriting Functions in a Nutshell\nGraphical Output\nProgramming in the R Language\n\n3  Key Concepts on Probability\n\nThe Basics of Random Variables\nRisk Factors, Instruments, Random Variables and Mapping\nProbability\nProbability Mass Function and Probability Density Function\nCumulative Distribution Function\nPercentiles and Percentile Function\nBivariate Joint and Marginal Distribution Functions\nMultivariate Joint and Marginal Distribution Functions\nExpectation\nConditional Expectation\nVariance and Standard Deviation\nCovariance and Correlation\nSix Useful Rules For Correlation, Variance and Covariance\nA Note on Populations and Samples\nRelevance Of Probability, Random Variables and Expectation\n\n4  Tools for Describing Risk Factors and Portfolios\n\nCalculating Risk Factor Returns\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of Dispersion\nMeasures of Shape\n\n5  The Essentials of Hypothesis Testing for Risk Managers\n\nThe Basics: Normal Distribution\nCentral Limit Theorem\nHypothesis Testing\n\n6  Alternative Methods to Measure Correlation\n\nPopular Metrics for Measuring Correlation\nHypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals\nOther Useful Types of Correlation Coefficient\n\n7  A Primer on Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n\nThe Likelihood Equation\nThe Score Vector\nThe Information Matrix\nNewtonÃ¢â‚¬â€œRaphson Method\nLinear Regression\n\n8  Regression in a Nutshell\n\nParameter Estimation\nAssessing the Simple Linear Regression Model\nR-Squared and the Regression Model\nAssumptions of the Linear Regression Model\nMultiple Regression\n\n9  Fitting Probability Distributions to Data\n\nUnderstanding Probability Distributions\nLibrary Of Probability Distributions\n\n10  Practical Principal Component Analysis\n\nProcedure for Principal Component Analysis\nNumerical Estimation of Principal Components\nPrincipal Component Analysis in Market Risk Management\nScenario Analysis\n\n11  Three Essential Models for Volatility\n\nMastering Volatility\nMoving Average Model\nThe GARCH(1,1) Model\nExponentially Weighted Moving Average\n\n12  Random Numbers and Applied Simulation\n\nRandom Number Generation\nGenerating Fat-Tailed Random Variables\nHistorical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nCase Study: The Role of Gold in Lifecycle Retirement Wealth Accumulation\n\n13  Tail Risk Modelling\n\nValue-at-Risk Modelling\nCalculating VaR\nOther Models for Calculating VaR\nExtreme Value Theory\n\n14  Conclusion\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nDr Nigel D.
