In the early years of the band the vocalists were first Angie Carozzo and later Karin Oliver, a classmate of Defever in his freshman year at Eastern Michigan University before he dropped out to concentrate on music. Three cassettes were released, which attracted the attention of influential British record label 4AD Records. Livonia, His Name Is Alive&amp;#039;s first album, was released in 1990.\n\nAlbums\n\n1.
