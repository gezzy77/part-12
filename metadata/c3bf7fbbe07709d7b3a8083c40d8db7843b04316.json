If I get to much greif I will just kill it and walk away, that simple.\n\n2) I don't personally know of any sites that have information about this series except for the IMDB link listed above.\n\n3) As of 01 Nov '05 I will be relocating so will be off line for 3 weeks. That gives someone (or more) people 8-9 days to complete and seed. Once I return I will reseed.\n\n4) Except for the above I AM SEEDING, either the stats are wrong OR I am at my bandwidth limit.\n\nOtherwise hope it works, and enjoy.\nAnd remember, seeding AFTER completion is more important than how much you shared before completion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3bf7fbbe07709d7b3a8083c40d8db7843b04316","amp;dn":"Battletech+Cartoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3bf7fbbe07709d7b3a8083c40d8db7843b04316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,191,127,187,224,119,9,215,179,168,8,60,64,216,219,120,67,176,67,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
