With an ever-changing line up, the group essentially consists of its founder and only constant member, Mark E. Smith, who has said &quot;If it's me and your granny on bongos, then it's [the] Fall&quot;. First associated with the late 1970s punk movement, the band's music has evolved through numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's membership. The Fall's music is characterised by repetition and an abrasive guitar-driven sound, and is always underpinned by Smith's often cryptic lyrics, described by critic Steve Huey as &quot;abstract poetry filled with complicated wordplay, bone-dry wit, cutting social observations and general misanthropy.&quot;\nThe group's output is prolific: as of May 2013 they have released thirty studio albums, and more than triple that counting live albums and other releases. They have never achieved widespread public success beyond a handful of minor hit singles in the late 1980s, but have maintained a strong cult following. The band were long associated with BBC disc jockey John Peel, who championed them from early on in their career and cited the Fall as his favourite band, famously explaining, &quot;They are always different, they are always the same.\n\n\nReview:\nEven by the FallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notoriously prolific standards, 2013 has been a busy year for whatever poor sod has to update the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discography on Wikipedia. The past few months have seen the release of a spirited if sloppy full-length, Re-Mit; at least two live albums (the latest of which is simply called Live, presumably because Mark E. Smith has run out of titles); and now, that relatively rare beast in the Fall canon, an EP of all new material. And despite the leftovers its title implies, The Remainderer is actually being touted by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a bridging pointÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between Re-Mit and yet another new album coming in 2014.\nOf course, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strange to hear any Fall release described in relation to whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come before and what will come after. The Fall don't so much logically evolve on an album-by-album basis as randomly mutate. Even in those rare periods of line-up consistencyÃ¢â‚¬â€as Smith has enjoyed with his current charges for the past five yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€the sound, form, and quality of any particular Fall record seems to be a matter of pure happenstance, dependent on nothing so much as how many pints were swilled on the way to the studio, or if all the players involved had a proper breakfast. Of course, we all know that Mark E. Smith is the Fall, but the Fall is not just Mark E. Smith, and, as ever, their success is dependent on those magical moments when SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free-ranging ramble serendipitously interlocks with his groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wandering rhythms and pin-prick riffs.\nMore than anything, The Remainderer is an encouraging sign that stability has yet to ossify into stagnation with this ongoing iteration of the band, who formidably exercise their elasticity over the course of these six wildly divergent tracks. But weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re eased in on familiar footing, with an inviting title track that tumbles down the stairs like a cousin to Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ClassicalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and thus feels very much like the sort of Fall song Pavement wouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to rewrite in their Gary Young days; only SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recently developed affinity for frog-throated, guttural grunts betrays it as a product of 2013. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mode of vocaliziation that, for better or worse, Smith is dead-set on embracing in his golden years: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Amorator!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is less a song than a slurred, spoken-word spiel set to a droning, unwavering punkabilly skitter; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Touchy PadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a tortured, tuneless duet with keyboardist/wife Elena Poulou, despite its tasteful, acoustic-based arrangement. And though Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rememberance Ã¢â‚¬ËœRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is hardly the first Fall song that wants to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Wanna Be Your DogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it actually gets more interesting once a wheezing Smith steps away from the mic, and has engineer Simon Ã¢â‚¬Å“DingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Archer let loose with a rant about some unnamed reunited rock bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of entitlement.\nBut when Smith actually takes the time to hork out whatever loogie is lodged in his esophagus, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in top form: the car-crash medley of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say Mama/Race With the DevilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ makes for a great, grease-stained companion to the FallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better known, more polished Gene Vincent cover, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mister RodeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ boasts a classic Smithian see-saw chorusÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“I got a name!/ I got a face!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€over a pleasingly meandering, bass-battered groove that builds into a surprisingly dramatic (by Fall standards) fuzzed-out finale. Ultimately, the only thing that really connects The Remainderer to Re-Mit is a similar, slightly above average hit-to-miss ratio, though the abbreviated format works to its advantage. At the very least, you now know what to get for the miserable bastard on your holiday shopping list.\nReview By Stuart Berman [6.9/10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\nI. The Remainderer\nII.
