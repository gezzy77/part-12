Your soldiers are being flanked and the perimeter is slowly collapsing under a vicious alien assault. Robotic turrets will not last much longer. Just a little more and the bugs will swarm into your unprotected base. What are your orders?\r\nYou order your soldiers to fall back to a defensive chokepoint and rebuild your defenses. Sacrifice the forward squads to gain some extra time. Gather your team while equipping them with flamethrowers and laser guns. Start building a siege cannon for fire support. Then, while the aliens are busy, flank their main hives to destroy and capture them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c14316dac7abed53656a12ccd82c4329e3c6dade","amp;dn":"Infested+Planet+v1.10.5+Incl+ALL+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c14316dac7abed53656a12ccd82c4329e3c6dade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,67,22,218,199,171,237,83,101,106,18,204,216,44,67,41,227,198,218,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
