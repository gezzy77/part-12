Yet while Eisenhower was quickly viewed by many as a doddering lightweight, behind the bland smile and simple speech was a master tactician. To end the hostilities, Eisenhower would take a colossal risk by bluffing that he might use nuclear weapons against the Communist Chinese, while at the same time restraining his generals and advisors who favored the strikes. Ike's gamble was of such magnitude that there could be but two outcomes: thousands of lives saved, or millions of lives lost.\n\nA tense, vivid and revisionist account of a president who was then, and still is today, underestimated, IKE'S BLUFF is history at its most provocative and thrilling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1307e706811ea260250fba0780178452cb6bfa46","amp;dn":"Ike%27s+Bluff%3A+President+Eisenhower%27s+Secret+Battle+to+Save+the+Wo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1307e706811ea260250fba0780178452cb6bfa46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,7,231,6,129,30,162,96,37,15,186,7,128,23,132,82,203,107,250,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
