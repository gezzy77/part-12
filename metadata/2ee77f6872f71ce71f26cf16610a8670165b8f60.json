All new in 2015. Create gorgeous, custom websites without writing code. If you know Adobe InDesign you'll know Adobe Muse, the graphic designer's favorite web-building app. Skip the coding and quickly design unique sites using familiar features and shortcuts, and integrate third-party functionality like blogs and shopping carts.\r\n\r\nThe easy way to create robust, standards-based sites.\r\nDesign the sites you want with access to thousands of premium Adobe Typekit web fonts and millions of images from the new Adobe Stock service. Add the functionality you need, like blogs and online stores. And publish with the hosting provider of your choice. Your sites will load quickly, they'll work across platforms and on a variety of browsers and devices, and they can be found by search engines like Google.\r\n\r\nMillions of high-quality images for your Adobe Muse projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew in Adobe Muse CC 2015.1 | February 2016\r\n\r\nResponsive web design\r\nThe Adobe Muse CC February 2016 release brings in several exciting new features, including free-form responsive design and integration with Creative Cloud Libraries. Continue reading for more information about new features, and links that offer more learning resources.\r\nIn the earlier versions of Adobe Muse, you could only create adaptive sites. That is, websites that adapted to the browser widths of different devices. The page and the page elements were not fluid, or did not scale for each browser width. The page layout was fixed for specific browser widths.\r\n\r\nStarter files for responsive web design\r\nGet a jump-start to your design with responsive starter templates. Adobe Muse offers customizable, responsive starter files that you can access from the Adobe Muse website. Choose an appropriate template, open it, and add content to suit your requirement. If required, add new breakpoints or edit the default breakpoints. Customize the design and publish your responsive website with a few clicks.\r\n\r\nCreative Cloud Libraries in Adobe Muse\r\nCreative Cloud Libraries, powered by Adobe CreativeSync technology, enable you to access your favorite assets from home, office, or even when you're on-the-go. Create images, colors and more using Photoshop, Illustrator, or mobile apps like Adobe Capture CC. Access these assets across other desktop and mobile apps for a seamless creative workflow.\r\n\r\nState transition\r\nAdobe Muse 2015.1 allows you to import SVG files into an image frame, crop the image, and apply fill and stroke. If there are no frames, you can now import an SVG file directly, create a frame, and then crop the image. You can also add SVG images to slideshows. These SVG graphic improvements give you additional flexibility while designing slideshows.\r\n\r\nEnhancements in Adobe Muse 2015.1\r\nIn the Swatches panel, you can now import and export Swatch libraries through the Context menu.\r\nAdobe Muse 2015.1 supports rotation detection in Exif content. Images that have rotation information embedded in them, will now be rotated to landscape when placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[url=https://helpx.adobe.com/muse/using/whats-new.html]What's New in Adobe Muse CC 2015.1[/url][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee77f6872f71ce71f26cf16610a8670165b8f60","amp;dn":"Adobe+Muse+CC+2015.1.0+Multilingual+Portable%5Bby+robert%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee77f6872f71ce71f26cf16610a8670165b8f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,231,127,104,114,247,28,231,31,38,207,22,97,10,134,112,22,91,143,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
