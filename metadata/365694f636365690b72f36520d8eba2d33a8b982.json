Everyone from young adults to grandparents will be fascinated by the answers uncovered in James West Davidsonâ€™s vividly told A Little History of the United States.

Pilgrim William Bradford stumbles into an Indian deer trap on his first day in America; Harriet Tubman lets loose a pair of chickens to divert attention from escaping slaves; the toddler Andrew Carnegie, later an ambitious industrial magnate, gobbles his oatmeal with a spoon in each hand.
