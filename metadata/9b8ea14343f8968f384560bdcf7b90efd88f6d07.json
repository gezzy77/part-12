G. Pounds, &quot;An Historical Geography 0f Europe 450bc-AD1330&quot; \n 1973 | pages: 490 | ISBN: 0521085632 | PDF | 25,3 mb\n\n Every age has its own geography, separate and distinct from the geographies of earlier and succeeding ages. This 1973 book seeks to examine the complex of natural and man-made features which have provided the background of history, influencing its course and themselves modified by human action. Professor Pounds examines five short periods, each of which is not only relatively well documented, but also important in the climax of a civilisation. In a sense, each represents the climax of a longer period of historical development. The aim is to survey the whole of Europe for each of the chosen periods, not merely those areas which have been highlighted by documents and events. Northern Europe in the age of Pericles and eastern Europe in all periods are, for example, examined, alongside the better-known Mediterranean region, France and the Rhineland. Considerable use is made of maps, all specially prepared for this book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b8ea14343f8968f384560bdcf7b90efd88f6d07","amp;dn":"An+Historical+Geography+0f+Europe+450bc-AD1330","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b8ea14343f8968f384560bdcf7b90efd88f6d07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,142,161,67,67,248,150,143,56,69,96,189,207,123,144,239,216,143,109,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
