Both come on like a hybrid of Billie Holiday and Lauryn Hill who's had a tipple and then attempted one more late-night set at a supper club than they should have. Despite her boozy persona and loose-limbed delivery, though, Winehouse is an excellent vocalist possessing both power and subtlety, the latter an increasingly rare commodity among contemporary female vocalists (whether jazz or R&amp;B). What lifts her above Macy Gray is the fact that her music and her career haven't been marketed within an inch of their life. Instead of Gray's stale studio accompaniments, Winehouse has talented musicians playing loose charts behind her with room for a few solos. Instead of a series of vocal mellifluities programmed to digital perfection, Winehouse's record has the feeling of being allowed to grow on its own -- without being meddled with and fussed over (and losing its soul in the process). Simply hearing Winehouse vamp for a few minutes over some Brazilian guitar lines on &quot;You Sent Me Flying&quot; is a rare and immense pleasure. Also, like Nellie McKay (but unlike nearly all of her contemporaries), Winehouse songs like &quot;Fuck Me Pumps,&quot; &quot;Take the Box,&quot; and &quot;I Heard Love Is Blind&quot; cast a cool, critical gaze over the music scene, over the dating scene, and even over the singer herself. With &quot;In My Bed,&quot; she even proves she can do a commercial R&amp;B production, and a club version of &quot;Moody's Mood for Love&quot; not only solidifies her jazz credentials but proves she can survive in the age of Massive Attack. --Allmusic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01 Stronger Than Me 03:54\n02 You Sent Me Flying / Cherry 06:51\n03 Know You Now 03:03\n04 Fuck Me Pumps 03:21\n05 I Heard Love Is Blind 02:10\n06 Moody's Mood For Love / Teo Licks 03:29\n07 (There Is) No Greater Love 02:09\n08 In My Bed 05:17\n09 Take The Box 03:20\n10 October Song 03:25\n11 What Is It About Men 03:30\n12 Help Yourself 05:01\n13 Amy Amy Amy / Outro 13:17\n\nPersonnel:\n\nVocals: Amy Winehouse\nGuitar: Amy Winehouse, Binky Griptite, Thomas Brenneck, Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith\nHarp: Helen Tunstall\nViolin: Perry Montague-Mason, Chris Tombling, Tom Pigott-Smith, Warren Zielinski, Boguslaw Kostecki, Liz Edwards, Mark Berrow, Peter Hanson, Everton Nelson, Jonathan Rees\nViola: Jon Thorne, Katie Wilkinson, Rachel Bolt, Bruce White\nCello: John Heley, Joely Koos, Anthony Pleeth\nAlto Saxophone: Andy Mackintosh, Chris Davies\nTenor Saxophone: Jamie Talbot, Mike Smith, Neal Sugarman\nBaritone Saxophone: Ian Hendrickson-Smith, Vincent Henry, Dave Bishop\nTrumpet: Steve Sidwell, Dave Guy\nBass Trumpet: Bruce Purse\nTenor Trombone: Richard Edwards\nTenor Sax: Teo Avery\nBass Guitar: Salaam Remi, Nick Movshon, Gregory &quot;Mr Bassie&quot; Jackson\nRhodes Piano: John Adams, Teo Avery, Amy Winehouse\nDrums: Troy Auxilly-Wilson, Homer Steinweiss, Errol &quot;Crusty&quot; Campbell\nPercussion: Frank Ricotti\nHand-Claps: Vaughan Merrick, Mark Ronson, Victor Axelrod\nRhythm and sound effects: The RZA\n\n\nRipping Equipment:\nTT: Technics SP 15 with SME 3009 tonearm &amp; customized plinth\nCartridge: Ortofon Concorde OM 30 MM\nPhono amp: Pro-Ject Tube Box II with 2X JAN 12AX 7WA (General Electric)\nCables: Wire World Solstice 5.2\nComputer: Sony Vaio VPCJ1\nADC: Tascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nSoftware: WaveLab 5.01, ClickRepair, Redbook Resampled And Dithered with iZotope RX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c9c470d50614e8f53464ac7feef4870c9ee5f2d","amp;dn":"Amy+Winehouse+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Frank+%28UK+2003%29+%5BVinyl+24%2F96%5D-Kel+Bazar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c9c470d50614e8f53464ac7feef4870c9ee5f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,156,71,13,80,97,78,143,83,70,74,199,254,239,72,112,201,238,95,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
