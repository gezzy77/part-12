Dolmen Music: Overture and Men's Conclave/Wa-0hs/Rain/Pine Tree Lullaby\n\n\nBeyond categories like instrumental music, art songs, or opera, Monk's music pivots on extraordinary contrasts--leaps from mellifluous flow to staccato, and extreme register utterances. The shorter pieces on Dolmen Music have distinct art song-- or even pop--traces in their rolling piano figures and attention to melody. But the title suite is a generous reigning in of Robert Een's deliberate cello, Julius Eastman's colorful percussion, and an array of vocal tones that couple low, long bellows with short bursts of high, almost electronic-sounding palpitations. Monk has made vocal music without compare in this piece. -- Andrew Bartlett \n(review - amazon.com)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb62d51e8c6980f10a75fce8c234541685390021","amp;dn":"Meredith+Monk+-+Dolmen+Music+%28lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb62d51e8c6980f10a75fce8c234541685390021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,98,213,30,140,105,128,241,10,117,252,232,194,52,84,22,133,57,0,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
