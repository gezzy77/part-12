I&amp;#039;m going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world, where anything is possible. Where we go from there, this is a choice I leave to you.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c1f52026954215587f72980b0b2bb102d26797","amp;dn":"Dr+Zhivago","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c1f52026954215587f72980b0b2bb102d26797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,193,245,32,38,149,66,21,88,127,114,152,11,11,43,177,2,210,103,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
