MP3 was ripped gapless since it's a live performance but FLAC was left untouched.  For best results play this in Foobar as it will detect and adjust for this.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/b4a3326941093d2ef6c24e7d9c0b17860d09f521.jpg[/img]\n\n[quote]By Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue* VINE VOICE on November 28, 2009\n&quot;The celebration of Christmas is, for many people, the first musical experience of their lives as children and later, perhaps, their earliest musical memory. The music of Christmas, whether it be an oratorio by Bach or a traditional Christmas carol, provides an emotional focus for our childhood notions of belief and the Christmas story: the first time in our lives that we were moved by music.&quot; ~ Michael Letchford ~\n\n&quot;A Celebration of Christmas&quot; was recorded live at a concert in Vienna in December of 1995 and the album was released the following year. The live concert was broadcast to the delight of over 50 million people around the world. Three renowned artists in the music world graced the show; JosÃƒÂ© Carreras, PlÃƒÂ¡cido Domingo and Natalie Cole.\n\nThe concert's repertoire was performed by the trio in varied styles and flavors in different languages. They are supported by the lush Wiener Symphony Orchestra conducted by Vjekoslav Sutej and the Vienna Children's Opera Choir with Chorus Director, Elizabeth Ziegler. Lalo Schifrin, one of the well-regarded composers/conductors in the history of classical music, arranged and adapted the music in the repertoire except for &quot;O Joyful Children.&quot;\n\nThe program is a mix of classical and popular music, devotional and inspirational songs, and traditional and contemporary Christmas carols. All the performances are inspiring and uplifting so there is never a dull moment listening to the entire disc. There's more to this album than just Christmas music. This is the kind of music that evokes the true essence of Christmas rendered spotlessly by a trio of incredible talents.\n\nNatalie Cole never ceases to amaze me with her vocal style. She conveys timeless charms to any song that she interprets. She glows as she renders two well-applauded definitive songs for the Holiday Season, &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; and &quot;Winter Wonderland.&quot;\n\n&quot;Panis Angelicus&quot; by JosÃƒÂ© Carreras and &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; by PlÃƒÂ¡cido Domingo exude a universal feeling in music which dispels the notion that one has to understand the language to appreciate the songs.\n\nThe trio's renditions of &quot;I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as well as JosÃƒÂ© Carreras' solo in &quot;The Lord's Prayer&quot; provide the devotional and inspirational part of the program.\n\n&quot;What A Wonderful World&quot; and &quot;May Each Day&quot; are delightful additions to the concert's repertoire and although they are not Christmas carols, they certainly are not the weakest links. Both songs are remarkably rendered by the trio.\n\nWhat good is a Christmas collection without the best-loved carols such as &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; (Silent Night), &quot;Cantique de Noel&quot; (O Holy Night) and &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas?&quot; Well, they're all here in a Christmas disc that reminds us of the true spirit of the Season. I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's an elegant way to decorate your Christmas music collection.[/quote]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Natalie Cole - A Celebration of Christmas\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Natalie Cole\nAlbum................: A Celebration of Christmas\nGenre................: Christmas Classical\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996 10 29\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 50 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
