There are also some nicely judged essays from writers besides the estimable Sutcliffe himself. Fair dinkum, mate!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nGuitarist Magazine, January 2011\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This tome is a beautiful visual history of an amazing band, complete with stories of their beginnings, their steady rise to fame, and the shocking loss of frontman Bon Scott. Then you get the story of the group's second career, beginning with the smash album Back in Black. You can hear the sound of those guitars in every photo.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLondon-based journalist Phil Sutcliffe has been writing about rock since 1974 and has interviewed greats like Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, and Queen.
