Almost Nothing puts the question of the meaning of life back at the centre of intellectual debate. Its central concern is how we can find a meaning to human finitude without recourse to anything that transcends that finitude. A profound but secular meditation on the theme of death, Critchley traces the idea of nihilism through Blanchot, Levinas, Jena Romanticism and Cavell, culminating in a reading of Beckett, in many ways the hero of the book.\nIn this second edition, Simon Critchley has added a revealing and extended new preface, and a new chapter on Wallace Stevens which reflects on the idea of poetry as philosophy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8c39db6998d469bdae8c7ca4183f4bdd19e348","amp;dn":"Very+Little+...+Almost+Nothing%3A+Death%2C+Philosophy+and+Literature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8c39db6998d469bdae8c7ca4183f4bdd19e348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,140,57,219,105,152,212,105,189,174,140,124,164,24,63,75,221,25,227,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
