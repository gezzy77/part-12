The characters in this high-paced film live in a violent reality where enemies live as neighbours. It is a meeting of conflicting views ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Jews and Arabs, Christians and Moslems, fathers and sons, cops and robbers. As the films jolts from one point of view to the other it creates an alternative truth, a new surprising expression of the human experience. Shuttling back and forth through time, we witness the events over and over again through the eyes of a different character, and every time our perception of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhat is rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ changes, triggering opposing emotional reactions. We are forced to ask ourselves the eternal question: how do people with the same basic values and moral conscience become blood enemies?
