This is an interesting concept that I would never have thought of. I made the red velvet cake, and it only took three minutes. It was amazing to see that it was really red velvet cake after such little effort. My family loved the cake and couldn't believe it was made with such little effort. Everyone who has seen this book, wants one. There are so many different types of cakes. I intend to make many of them. Very few ingredients are required. We are going to have a cake-in-a-mug party and bake as many of them as we can. I like the idea of using paper party cups. They are pretty, and you don't have to wash them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f6f26c89eaa4046f51ceb908f0cf8a786444fba","amp;dn":"Mug+Cakes%3A+100+Speedy+Microwave+Treats+to+Satisfy+Your+Sweet+Too","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f6f26c89eaa4046f51ceb908f0cf8a786444fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,111,38,200,158,170,64,70,245,28,235,144,143,12,248,167,134,68,79,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
