Filled with complex characters, intriguing flights of fancy, and all the beautiful visuals you'd expect from the director of MirrorMask, Cages is McKean's magnum opus. It chronicles the intersecting lives of a painter, a writer, and a musician living in the same apartment building, and is a profound rumination on art, God, cats, and the cages we build for ourselves. Out of print for years, Cages is finally available again, painstakingly rescanned from the original art and redesigned from the ground up by McKean. This affordable softcover edition provides more readers than ever the opportunity to experience the graphic novel that Terry Gilliam calls &quot;mesmerizing.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f3c1855a6433fcc098b291471439a04289a55a","amp;dn":"Dave+McKean%3A+Cages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f3c1855a6433fcc098b291471439a04289a55a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,243,193,133,90,100,51,252,192,152,178,145,71,20,57,160,66,137,165,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
