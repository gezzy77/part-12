It's never been easier to use the cottage in winter, but the season brings a special set of problems and questions. What's the best way to protect the building and the plumbing from the cold and the ice? What are these odd tracks and unfamiliar noises? How well will our gear survive if we leave it all winter? Here is a collection of our favourite questions from Cottage Life magazine readers and answers from experts, about one of the most rewarding times of year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75de677f65452c791348e978cd757074936f9f78","amp;dn":"Winter+Cottaging+-+How+to+enjoy+your+cottage+all+year+round+-+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75de677f65452c791348e978cd757074936f9f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,222,103,127,101,69,44,121,19,72,233,120,205,117,112,116,147,111,159,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
