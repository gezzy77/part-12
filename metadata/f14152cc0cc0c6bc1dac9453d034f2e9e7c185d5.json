Recalling the past thirteen years from the daily letters the author and her mother, who lives in Chile, wrote to each other, Allende bares her soul in a book that is as exuberant and full of life as its creator. She recounts the stories of the wildly eccentric, strong-minded, and eclectic tribe she gathers around her that becomes a new kind of family.\n\nThroughout, Allende shares her thoughts on love, marriage, motherhood, spirituality and religion, infidelity, addiction, and memory. Here, too, are the amazing stories behind AllendeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books, the superstitions that guide her writing process, and her adventurous travels. Ultimately, The Sum of Our Days offers a unique tour of this gifted writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner world and of the relationships that have become essential to her life and her work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14152cc0cc0c6bc1dac9453d034f2e9e7c185d5","amp;dn":"Isabel+Allende+-+The+Sum+of+Our+Days+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14152cc0cc0c6bc1dac9453d034f2e9e7c185d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,65,82,204,12,192,198,188,29,172,148,83,208,52,242,233,231,193,133,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
