Wayne Gilbert has decades of animation experience behind his observations, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. \n\nFor me, as an animator, it's a no-brainer to have this on my shelf with me at work. It covers far more than &quot;just thumbnails,&quot; and does a great job of simplifying complex concepts such as force and you'll really get a great feel for what happens in the body when it's lifting something heavy or hanging or fighting. \n\nI can't tell you how many professional animators I know who swear by this book. It's short, but awesome.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6915510c36c02644ca7729181a062b9bd92173d","amp;dn":"Simplified+Drawing+for+Planning+Animation%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6915510c36c02644ca7729181a062b9bd92173d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,145,85,16,195,108,2,100,76,167,114,145,129,160,98,185,189,146,23,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
