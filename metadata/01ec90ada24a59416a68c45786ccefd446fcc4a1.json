ScandinaviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Svart Records have unleashed another fine metal album. Rocking with the overdose of power and playing at no mercy speeds, these Finn boys sound like a herd of titanium mammoths charging head first into a tornado, and come out unscathed.\n\nMetal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a belief system. Its roots run so strong in the iron veins of all those who adhere to it, that in times of stress, sometimes there are those who utterly go crazy over it. Will you cut SpeedtrapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s logo into your wrist? Probably not, but if you do, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a real cool dude.\n\nInspired by the likes of MotÃƒÂ¶rhead, and on par with the likes of Enforcer and Cauldron, Speedtrap has a definitive classic sound.\n\n\n1.
