Beautifully illustrated with 700 color photographs providing wonderful detail and smartly organized to take the hassle out identification, you will enjoy the simplicity of the guide and the enthusiasm and knowledge of author Patti Polk, one of the top agate collectors in the world and a self-proclaimed &quot;rockhound.&quot; You will also enjoy two areas that our competitors don't bother with. First it includes values, and second, it covers an introduction to lapidary, which is the cutting and polishing of rocks and gemstones for jewelry or display.\n\n\nBy Patti Polk\nPublished by F+W Media in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 154 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff5ec2eba4c9b84e3359dce487423e8f178feb18","amp;dn":"Collecting+Rocks%2C+Gems+and+Minerals%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff5ec2eba4c9b84e3359dce487423e8f178feb18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,94,194,235,164,201,184,78,51,89,220,228,135,66,62,143,23,143,235,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
