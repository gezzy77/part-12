This courseÃ¢â‚¬â€focused on the principles, not the tools, of animationÃ¢â‚¬â€explores how anatomy, expression, and emotion intertwine, and how animators can simulate emotion in the face of almost any character. George Maestri shows you how to animate three shots, of increasing complexity: a silent &quot;double take&quot; that transitions from one emotion to the next, a simple close-up dialogue shot, and a full-body dialogue shot that accounts for posture and secondary motion.\nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUnderstanding the role asymmetry plays in facial expression\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tConveying basic and mixed emotions\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tPlanning shots\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBlocking out timing\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tReading dialogue\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAnimating lip sync\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding blinks and eye movement\n\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1454e6b61990319346cfba48b2114f5a6f76cf57","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Fundamentals+of+Character+Animation%3A+Facial+Animation+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1454e6b61990319346cfba48b2114f5a6f76cf57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,84,230,182,25,144,49,147,70,207,186,72,178,17,79,90,111,118,207,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
