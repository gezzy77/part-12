It was later syndicated in the United States with some editing to remove scenes of nudity and violence. Total Recall 2070 is very loosely based on two works by the author Philip K. Dick: his short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,&quot; which was adapted into the film Total Recall, and his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which was adapted into the film Blade Runner.\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_2070\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0159920/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff490db5d69c1c0d3d2352e93a94ac4eae6ccc3","amp;dn":"Total+Recall+2070+DVDrip+complete+series+%5BAtilla82%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff490db5d69c1c0d3d2352e93a94ac4eae6ccc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,244,144,219,93,105,193,192,211,210,53,46,147,169,74,196,234,230,204,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
