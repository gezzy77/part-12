I was driving somewhere in Orlando, late one evening, when the DJ of the local jazz radio station started to play Live at the Grand Opera House in its entirety. When I arrived at my destination I sat in my car, transfixed, and didn't even turn off the engine until I had listened to the very last note of the concert. I had never heard anything like it! The next morning I went out and bought the album and it has remained one of my favorite works of art to this day.\nThis CD is a work of art, by a man who is one of the most influential and prolific songwriters of all time. I also happen to think that this CD showcases Van at the zenith of his brilliant career. The Belfast show can be appreciated on so many different levels. The lyrics themselves are a religious experience.\n\nBut even if Van Morrison wasn't such an incredible poet/songwriter he would still be producing some of the most entertaining music ever created, simply because he continuously surrounds himself with the most talented musicians and back-up singers available. This CD is a shining testiment to that. The flow of the concert is remarkable, the musicians are all spot on throughout and the back-up singers all have voices that most front men would kill for. This is as close to perfection as I've ever heard.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVan Morrison - Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Van Morrison\nAlbum................: Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1984 02\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 69 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285792b503899dcb0049d29424667a69dea185c9","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Live+At+Grand+Opera+House+Belfast+%5BFLAC%2BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285792b503899dcb0049d29424667a69dea185c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,87,146,181,3,137,157,203,0,73,210,148,36,102,122,105,222,161,133,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
