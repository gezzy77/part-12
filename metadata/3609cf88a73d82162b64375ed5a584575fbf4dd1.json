This course begins with a tour of AutoCADÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interface and the tools used to create basic shapes. It then focuses on the methods used to modify and refine geometry while emphasizing accuracy and good habits to build a solid design foundation. The course covers using layers, line types, and colors to organize a drawing file and explains how to efficiently annotate a design and prepare it for final output. Throughout the title, Jeff shares industry techniques used in production and reinforces concepts using practical examples. Exercise files are included with the course.\n\nTopics include:\n\nUnderstanding model space\nWorking in a multiple-document environment\nOrganizing drawings using layers\nCreating basic geometry\nConfiguring units for architectural, civil, or metric work\nIncorporating blocks (symbols) into a working file\nMaintaining accuracy with coordinates and snaps\nCreating annotations that automatically size themselves\nMoving and copying elements\nTransferring data between drawings\nPreparing standardized layouts with title blocks\nSharing drawings\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO USE .iso FILES DOWNLOAD THIS;      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3609cf88a73d82162b64375ed5a584575fbf4dd1","amp;dn":"LYNAD.COM+-+AUTOCAD+2011+ESSENTIAL+TRAINING+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3609cf88a73d82162b64375ed5a584575fbf4dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,9,207,136,167,61,130,22,43,100,55,94,213,165,132,87,95,191,77,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
