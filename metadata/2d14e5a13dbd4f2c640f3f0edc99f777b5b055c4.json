However, his conscience is no longer clear to the point of absolute certainty about the man's guilt. Also of intense interest to the lawman is the parallel between the current events and a legendary murder and execution over 100 years old -- the story of a great injustice, and a woman condemned to die for a crime she didn't commit. Suddenly, the sheriff finds himself in a race against and across time to see that history doesn't repeat itself!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d14e5a13dbd4f2c640f3f0edc99f777b5b055c4","amp;dn":"Sharyn+++McCrumb-The+Ballad+of+Frankie+Silver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d14e5a13dbd4f2c640f3f0edc99f777b5b055c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,20,229,161,61,189,79,44,100,15,63,14,220,153,247,119,181,176,85,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
