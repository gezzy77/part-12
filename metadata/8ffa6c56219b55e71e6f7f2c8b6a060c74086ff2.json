It is spoken not only in Spain, but\nthroughout Latin America, with the exception of Brazil,\nand even there, where the official language is Portuguese,\nyou could make yourself understood. That is, of course,\nif you can also make yourself understood to a Spaniard.\nIt is the purpose of this book to enable you to do so.\n\nWhen you have worked through it, you should be in a\nposition to read any Spanish novel or newspaper, to speak\nenough of the language to be able to converse and to write\nit comprehensibly, though your rendering will not be fault-\nless.\n\nThis book follows in the main the model of Teach Your-\nself French, published in the same series. There are several\nreasons for this. In the first place, I hope that some who\nstudied that volume may be encouraged to tackle this one,\nand, knowing the ways of the first, they will find it the\nmore easy to embark upon its companion. Secondly, what\nproved successful in one case, may reasonably be considered\nlikely to prove acceptable in. another, so that people coming\nfresh to this book should be able to make as good use of it\nas those who studied Teach Yourself French.\n\nAt first sight it would seem that, by following the\nmethods of another volume, I lay myself open to a charge\nof plagiarism. This accusation leaves my withers (whatever\nthey may be) unwrung. For, as I was responsible for\nmodernising Sir John Adams' admirable Teach Yourself\nFrench, I see no reason why I should not be allowed to\nborrow from myself. After all, as the lunatic very\nluminously observed: &quot;If I can't bang my head against\nmy own mantelpiece, whose mantelpiece can I bang it\nagainst?&quot;\n\nThis book, then, follows the same lines as Teach Yourself\nFrenchÃ¢â‚¬â€so far, that is, as the different natures of the two\nlanguages will permit. It aims at steering a middle course\nbetween dreary sentences about Grandmother's thimble\nand phrases 01 idiomatic slang. For those, by the way,\nwho do want to acquire racy up-to-date idiom, I would\nrecommend the perusal of Brighter Spanish, by Sr. L. de\nBaeza (Bles), and of Brush Up Your Spanish, by the same\nauthor (Dent).\n\nObviously, however, one must first have something to\nbrush. It is the modest aim of this book to provide that\nfoundation, to give any student of it a knowledge of the\nessentials of Spanish, to tell him something about Spain,\nand to fit him to learn a good deal more about both. If\nthis purpose is in any way achieved, it will be largely due\nto the help given me by Srta. Miren de Albizuri of Bilbao,\nespecially in the preparation of the Spanish passages for\ntranslation.\n\nI am also obliged to Mr. Gil Nevaz, whose suggestions\nhave led to some corrections and improvements in this\nedition of the book.\n\n\nNote(s):\n\n\n1. Number of pages: 244\n2. Book edition: twelfth\n3. Learning method: Grammar translation\n4.
