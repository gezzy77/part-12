Instead of the more recent Francois Pignon, we have FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Perrin, who comes off as a French Schlepprock.\n\nA French/Mexican co-production, we have the odd situation where almost everybody in Mexico speaks French, even when not asked to.  The strangest thing is that continuity fails a bit, when there actually are characters who do not speak French. I don't think a single one even attempts to speak French with a Mexican accent.\n\nDon't let that little nitpick stop you from enjoying this quite enjoyable film.\n\nA clutzy accountant is hired as a detective to find a lost clutz of a girl.  The logic astounds me as much as it did Depardieu's character. \n\nFairly insubstantial extras make most of the data the film itself.\n\nUncompressed PAL DVD9 VIDEO_TS files\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05cd9d207d2943a75bf5e4d46a9cdd10ff0d0d73","amp;dn":"Francis+Veber+%2F+P.+Richard+%2F+G.+Depardieu+-La+chevre+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05cd9d207d2943a75bf5e4d46a9cdd10ff0d0d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,205,157,32,125,41,67,167,91,245,228,212,106,156,221,16,255,13,13,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
