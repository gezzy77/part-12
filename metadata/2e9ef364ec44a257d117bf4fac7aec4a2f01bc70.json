It is up to the Interstellar Alliance, with the help of the Rangers, to rebuild what the great war destroyed and to hold peace among the worlds of the ISA.\n\nIn the year 2265, David Martel (Dylan Neal), a Ranger, is given the command of a twenty-year-old Ranger starship, the Liandra, and is asked to escort a Valen-class cruiser to a secret location carrying several diplomats, including Ambassador G&amp;#039;Kar (Andreas Katsulas). However, upon arrival, the two craft are attacked on behalf of an unknown, mysterious, and ancient force known only as The Hand whose lethal power is far greater than any previously known to Earth or any other world in the Interstellar Alliance.\n\t &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280453/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280453/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9ef364ec44a257d117bf4fac7aec4a2f01bc70","amp;dn":"Babylon+5%3A+The+Legend+of+the+Rangers+%3A+To+Live+and+Die+in+Starli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e9ef364ec44a257d117bf4fac7aec4a2f01bc70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,158,243,100,236,68,162,87,209,23,191,79,172,122,236,74,47,1,188,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
