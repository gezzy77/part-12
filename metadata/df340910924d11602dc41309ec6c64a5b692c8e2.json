It looks at the sex scenes and unseens in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœusual suspectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Japan as well as in less obvious countries such as Pakistan, China, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Covering the gamut of love, lust, passion, and pleasure across Asia, these articles offer unique insights into the sometimes shadowy world of the carnal pleasures on offer and the hypocrisies surrounding them. Gathered from the views of unrepentant Ã¢â‚¬ËœsexpatsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, wayward tourists, and the locals themselves, in Red-light Nights, Bangkok Daze, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find revelations about the varied experiences this huge cast of characters participates in. Succumb to the lights, and weather the daze; youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find yourself exhilarated and waking to a newfound awareness of the complex, interesting and yet confusing world of sex in Asia.\n\nAbout the Author\nWilliam Sparrow is an American journalist based in Asia.
