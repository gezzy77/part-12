Readers\nshould be able to learn more about the Ã¢â€ â€™ characters, Ã¢â€ â€™ places, Ã¢â€ â€™ events, and Ã¢â€ â€™ magic than what is merely present\nin the Ã¢â€ â€™ books. Critical commentary on each chapter, character, place, and event is provided in an effort to help the\nreader better understand detailed content and realize possible underlying connections to a greater storyline.\nThis book is meant to cover only the actual series, the seven books that make up the actual story. There are a number\nof additional publications that are only indirectly related to the main story; some of these are:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A number of issues of The Daily Prophet were issued to fans, containing short &quot;news stories&quot; about happenings in\nthe Wizarding world. Apparently copyright by J. K. Rowling, the events these newspapers cover are outside the\nevents of the main story and thus are not covered here.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ &quot;Chocolate Frog&quot; candy was produced for a while, containing Famous Wizard cards; additionally, a Famous\nWizards trading card game was produced at one point. These cards were written by the author of the series. In at\nleast a few instances, the text from these cards has enhanced understanding of the series, and thus has been\nreferenced in this work.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Three books were published to raise money for charity.Introduction\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;, which has details of magical creatures that\nimprove our understanding of the role they play in the main books, is included in this study.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Quidditch Through the Ages has little to tell us that we cannot learn through the primary seven books, and so is\nlargely excluded. Some information from this book appears in the article on Ã¢â€ â€™ Quidditch.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The Tales of Beedle the Bard includes some information that sheds light on some characters and some magic in\nthe main story arc. This information is included in this study.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The author's web site [1] contains rather a lot of authoritative information about the overlooked corners of the\nwizarding world. While much of its content is irrelevant to our study, those areas that cast some illumination on\nthe books and on the creative process are referenced herein.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Various interviews with the author have appeared, both during production of the books and afterwards.\nTranscripts of these interviews have appeared on some fan sites. Where these interviews have improved\nunderstanding of the books, they have been referenced, though it is not always possible to provide links.\nThis book will explicitly not cover the Harry Potter films, video games, fan fiction, or other authorized or\nunauthorized works in the same fiction universe.\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389a173635c9de9b4997d2aae3ec8b935ca8d77e","amp;dn":"Muggles%27_Guide+about+Harry+Potter+series.pdf+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389a173635c9de9b4997d2aae3ec8b935ca8d77e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,154,23,54,53,201,222,155,73,151,210,170,227,236,139,147,92,168,215,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
