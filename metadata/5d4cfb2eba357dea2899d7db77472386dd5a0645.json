While the majority of these songs are from the East Coast, there are a few West Coast songs -- Snoop Dogg's &quot;Lay Low&quot; and Xzibit's &quot;X,&quot; both Dr. Dre productions -- and quite a few Dirty South songs: Ludacris' &quot;Southern Hospitality,&quot; Trina's &quot;Pull Over,&quot; Scarface's &quot;Look Me in My Eyes,&quot; Nelly's &quot;E.I.,&quot; and Mystikal's &quot;Shake Ya Ass.&quot; There are a few songs here that weren't big chart-toppers -- Talib Kweli's &quot;Blast,&quot; MOP's &quot;Ante Up (Robbing-Hoodz Theory),&quot; Poe Boy Family's &quot;Making It,&quot; and the Mos Def, Pharoahe Monch, Nate Dogg collaboration, &quot;Oh No -- yet thankfully made the album due to their quality. It's this offering of different styles and mix of chart-toppers and critical favorites that make Source Hip Hop Music Awards 2001 a representative sample of the year in rap, with a slight bias toward the East Coast. \n\nTrack Listing\n\n\n\n \n   1 Ms. Jackson - Outkast\n   2 Southern Hospitality - Ludacris\n   3 How Many Licks? - Lil' Kim and Sisqo\n   4 Bonnie &amp; Shyne - Shyne and Barrington Levy\n   5 Who's That Girl? - Eve\n   6 The Blast - Talib Kweli, Hi-Tek and Vinia Mojica\n   7 Pull Ova - Trina\n   8 Lay Low - Snoop Dogg, Master P, Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy and Tha Eastsidaz\n   9 Bow Wow (That's My Name) - Lil Bow Wow and Snoop Dogg\n   10 Gravel Pit - Wu-Tang Clan\n   11 Look Me In My Eyes - Scarface\n   12 E.I. - Nelly\n   13 Shake Ya Ass - Mystikal\n   14 &quot;X&quot; - Xzibit\n   15 Ante Up (Robbing-Hoodz Theory) - M.O.P. and Funkmaster Flex\n   16 Put It On Me - Ja Rule and Vita\n   17 Keep It Thoro - Prodigy\n   18 Bonus: Making It - The Poe Boy Family, Rick Ross and Brisco\n   19 Bonus: Oh No - Mos Def, Pharoahe Monch and Nate Dogg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4cfb2eba357dea2899d7db77472386dd5a0645","amp;dn":"The+Source+Hip-Hop+Music+Awards+2001+%5B2001%5D+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4cfb2eba357dea2899d7db77472386dd5a0645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,76,251,46,186,53,125,234,40,153,215,219,119,71,35,134,221,90,6,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
