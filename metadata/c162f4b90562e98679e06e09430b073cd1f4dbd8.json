Sixty years ago, the greatest crime against humanity was committed. Today itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a heartbeat away from happening again.\n\nIn Paraguay, a young reporter is found brutally murdered. In Berlin, a political activist is gunned down in the street. In Strasbourg, an international policeman is given the name of a beautiful young German womanÃ¢â‚¬â€and the first key to an extraordinary political plot.\n\nJoseph Volkmann knows that a string of killings around the world are linked by a single purpose. And he knows that Erica Kranz, whose journalist cousin had stumbled on the story, is linked to the plan.
