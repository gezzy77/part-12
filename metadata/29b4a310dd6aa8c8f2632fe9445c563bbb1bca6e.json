Before we delve into the step-by-step guides that show you how to customise and enhance some of the most widely used aspects of OS X, we first reveal to you our collection of 99 of the most useful and unknown Mac secrets, each designed to make your Mac experience that much smoother and more intuitive. In terms of the tutorials themselves, we did something a little different for you in this volume of The Mac Book. For the first time, and to complement our swathe of tutorials covering each of the apps in the ever-popular iLife and iWork suites, we have curated a set of creative projects for you. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b4a310dd6aa8c8f2632fe9445c563bbb1bca6e","amp;dn":"The+Mac+Book+Vol+10+-+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b4a310dd6aa8c8f2632fe9445c563bbb1bca6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,180,163,16,221,106,168,200,242,99,47,233,68,92,86,59,187,27,202,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
