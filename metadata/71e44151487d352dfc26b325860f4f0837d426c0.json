The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.\n\nIf Sven Vath is the Godfather of Techno, Chris Liebing would have to be the naughty uncle, or the crazy cousin or that village idiot that later turns out to be a genius. There are many great things to say about Chris, a resident at Omen (Sven's Club) having his own legendary Spinclub, CLR (his record label that has stood the test of time), other residencies at Cocoon Club in Amnesia (alongside Sven) then moving to co-hosting Mauro's Meganite, having his own night in Space Ibiza called Spinclub. However, one thing that can ALWAYS be said is that each set will be hard hitting, technically superb and even though you are likely to be sweaty, grimy and your feet will hurt - you will feel better after it.\n\nI don't want to say that I left the best till last, as all the DJs in this collection are amazing, but I would say that I left one of my personal favorites till last. If you ever find a gig where he is playing, make SURE you attend. Seriously, like pawn your brand new flatscreen TV to buy the tickets if you have to - you will thank yourself later.\n\nThis pack contains some real goodies including a few back to back sets with long time friend Speedy J which are a treat as well as a back to back with Mauro Picotto - and it is over 36 hours in total techno terrificness!\n\nChris Liebing - Live @ Cherry Moon Lokeren 20040220.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Club Fresh 20060104.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Cyberfactory 20050529.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ DJ Meeting 20060516.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Dj Sets Greece 20050220.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Eins Live Rocker 20050625.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Eins Live Rocker 20050807.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Eins Live Rocker 20051126.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Eins Live Rocker 20060108.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Eins Live Rocker 20060312.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Matrix 20060513.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Mayday - Troopa of Tomorrow - 20030430.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Ostermontag 20050328.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Pitch Control 20030000.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Plattenbau 20061216.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Rave Satelite 20050219.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Sensation Black 20020714.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ SSL Maximal 20050121.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ SSL Maximal 20060609.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Summer  Of Love 20050821.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Sweatboxer, Rotterdam 20030429.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Tenax Part 1 20060610.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Tenax Part 2 20060610.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Tenax Part 3 20060610.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Timewarp 20060409.mp3\nChris Liebing - Live @ Tuzla 20000218.mp3\nChris Liebing Vs GoodGroove - Live @ Globus Berlin 20050403.mp3\nChris Liebing Vs Mauro Picotto - Live @ Technoligical 2.mp3\nChris Liebing Vs SpeedyJ - Live @ 5 Days Off Melkweg Amsterdam 20050717.mp3\nChris Liebing Vs SpeedyJ - Live @ JJJ 20050110.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e44151487d352dfc26b325860f4f0837d426c0","amp;dn":"Gods+Collection+-+Chris+Liebing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e44151487d352dfc26b325860f4f0837d426c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,228,65,81,72,125,53,45,252,38,179,37,134,15,79,8,55,212,38,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
