Amidst the turmoil, a young man sets out on a journey seeking spiritual enlightenment by way of the sword, prepared to slay anyone who gets in his way.\n\nTakehiko Inoue's Vagabond, based on Eiji Yoshikawa's novel Musashi, is a fictional account of the life of Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645). The historical figure Miyamoto Mushashi, author of the philosophical strategy guide A Book of Five Rings, was a master of the sword and was revered as a &quot;Sword-Saint&quot;. He founded the Niten Ichi style of sword fighting which is typified by fighting with both long and short swords at once, holding the long sword in the right hand and the short sword with the left.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6641b3767cd8acbd0abae49f2a79697665dc12d7","amp;dn":"Vagabond+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6641b3767cd8acbd0abae49f2a79697665dc12d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,65,179,118,124,216,172,189,10,186,228,159,42,121,105,118,101,220,18,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
