It serves as the second single from her upcoming second studio album, No Boys Allowed. It was released digitally in the United States on October 12, 2010.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Pretty Girl Rock&quot; was directed by Joseph Kahn. In the video it shows Hilson portraying an array of historic black women. She takes on the roles of Josephine Baker, Dorothy Dandridge, Diana Ross as a member of The Supremes, Donna Summer, Janet Jackson, and T-Boz as a member of TLC. It premiered on November 11, 2010 on BET's 106 &amp; Park.\n\n&quot;Pretty Girl Rock&quot; was produced by Ne-Yo and Chuck Harmony. The song is about uniting women over their shared beauty rather than the jealousy that drives them apart. Hilson explained &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not meant to be a vain record. I want everybody to feel like they can do the Pretty Girl Rock. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like the hair brush in the mirror, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hate me cause IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m beautiful, cause you are. Everybody is beautiful. I want everyone to be able to sing that record.&quot;\n\nNo Boys Allowed is the upcoming second studio album by American singer-songwriter Keri Hilson, due to be released on December 21, 2010 through Mosley Music and Zone 4 Records.
