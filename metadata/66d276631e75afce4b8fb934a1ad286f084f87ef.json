At the same time, he created some of the most acclaimed songs and albums of his career, most of them written at his apartment at The Dakota on ManhattanÃ‚â€™s Upper West Side, including Mind Games, Whatever Gets You Thru the Night, IÃ‚â€™m Losing You, and Woman. He also remained highly active in the anti-war movement as well as numerous other progressive political causes.\nAs much as New York made an impact on Lennon and Ono by offering them an oasis of personal and creative freedom, so too did they shape the city. At a time when New York faced record high crime, economic fallout and seemed to be on the verge of collapse, Lennon and Ono became a beloved fixture in neighborhood restaurants, at Central Park, at sports events and at political demonstrations.\nLennon and Ono also bonded with millions of their fellow New Yorkers in their experience as immigrants. The film traces their struggle to remain in the U.S. when the Nixon administration sought to deport them, supposedly based on a narcotics violation, but which Lennon insisted was in response to his anti-war activities.\nLENNONYC features never-before heard studio recordings from the Double Fantasy sessions and never-before-seen outtakes from Lennon in concert and home movies that have only recently been transferred to video. It also features exclusive interviews with Ms. Ono, who cooperated extensively with the production and offers an unprecedented level of access, as well as with artists who worked closely with Lennon during this period, including Elton John and photographer Bob Gruen (who took the iconic photograph of Lennon in front of the skyline wearing a Ã‚â€œNew York CityÃ‚â€ t-shirt).\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/7558/0qpn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img407.imageshack.us/img407/7558/0qpn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9370/uao3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9370/uao3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4822/4vna.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4822/4vna.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/8770/ydev.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/8770/ydev.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7355/2c6u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7355/2c6u.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6513/p9g2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/6513/p9g2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 104 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.02 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=John%20Lennon%3A%20Plastic%20Ono%20Band&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=John%20Lennon%3A%20Plastic%20Ono%20Band&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Lennon%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Years&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Lennon%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gimme%20Some%20Truth%20-%20The%20Making%20of%20John%20Lennon%27s%20Imagine%20Album&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gimme%20Some%20Truth%20-%20The%20Making%20of%20John%20Lennon%27s%20Imagine%20Album&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n&quot;ed2k://|file|PBS.American.Masters.LENNONYC.HDTV.x264.720p.AC3.MVGroup.org.mkv|2170547865|9c0b8322df7a633a88a1e378b03e4447|/&quot;\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=LENNONYC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=LENNONYC&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d276631e75afce4b8fb934a1ad286f084f87ef","amp;dn":"PBS+American+Masters+LENNONYC+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d276631e75afce4b8fb934a1ad286f084f87ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,210,118,99,30,117,175,206,75,143,185,52,161,173,40,111,8,79,135,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
