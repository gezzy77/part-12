The first treks were led by gruff, but good-at-heart Major Seth Adams, backed up by his competent frontier scout, Flint McCullough. After Adams and McCullough, the wagon train was led by the avuncular Christopher Hale along with new scouts Duke Shannon and Cooper Smith. Many stories featured the trustworthy assistant wagonmaster Bill Hawks, grizzled old cook Charlie Wooster and a young orphan, Barnaby West.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050073/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050073/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is the 8th and final season of Wagon Train, the most sought after western series.\n\nEnjoy the show and thanks for choosing cOOt torents!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60746453cff83f688f06998cc98bbe822a352e77","amp;dn":"Wagon+Train+-+Season+8+complete+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60746453cff83f688f06998cc98bbe822a352e77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,116,100,83,207,248,63,104,143,6,153,140,201,139,190,130,42,53,46,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
