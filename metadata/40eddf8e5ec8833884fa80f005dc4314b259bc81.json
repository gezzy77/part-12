You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them \n\nwith magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain \n\nadditional dwarves as your experience level increases. \n\nSANDBOX GAME \nEach game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is \n\nrandomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the \n\nsky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, \n\nhumidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere \n\ndeep within the islands. \n\nCRAFTING \nOne feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily \n\naccessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, \n\narmor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves. \n\nRTS \nAt the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and \n\neat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of \n\nthem are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, \n\ngoblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long \n\nas the dwarves do not come into their field of vision. Others gather into quite large groups and try to break \n\ninto the dwarvesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ residence. \n\nTOWER DEFENSE \nEspecially dangerous are the waves of monsters that appear from time to time from portals. So, do not neglect to \n\nbuild a safe haven with strong walls and numerous trapdoors, cells, firing towers, and secret passageways. \n\nMAGIC \nAs a divine being, you possess various spells. You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, \n\nilluminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl \n\nfireballs at the monstersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to \n\nspeed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3.
