This mod attempts to fill the gap between what has already been done with other user mods and what vanilla textures already look good.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\nThis mod is intended to be used *in conjunction with* FakeFactory's Cinematic Mod (though it can definitely be used as a stand-alone, too!)\n\nRegular installation (stand-alone):\nExtract .vpk files to\nc:/program files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/hl2/custom\n\nHow to combine with Cinematic Mod:\n1. Download and install cinematic mod (steampipe version)\n2. Download GFCscape and use it to open the .vpk files (HDprops-themanclaw.vpk)\n3. Extract the contents of each .vpk file into c:/program files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/CM2013/hl2/custom/1_CMlooseFiles\n\n...That's it. You're done. When placed in that folder, HL2 will choose my files if there are any conflicts.\n\nPlease feel free to distribute and use this mod in any way you wish (other than sell), so long as you give &quot;themanclaw&quot; credit. \n\nPlease visit http://hl2.gamebanana.com/skins/136418 for more information and updates!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4223f5179a88b7e7027e64f811a29327af238822","amp;dn":"Half-Life+2+HD+hi-res+Props+Texture+Overhaul+Pack+HL2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4223f5179a88b7e7027e64f811a29327af238822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,35,245,23,154,136,183,231,2,126,100,248,17,162,147,39,175,35,136,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
