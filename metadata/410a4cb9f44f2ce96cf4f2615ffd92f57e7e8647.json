A creative toolbox, perfect for use in atmospheric compositions spanning anything from motion picture scores to modern pop and a wide array of other musical contexts.\n\nIt comes complete with ready-made amp/cab simulation settings for guitar and bass, including deep textures of bit crushed reverbs, bouncing delays and tremolos. Also, in addition to its settings tailored for vocals and drums, the Ambient EZmix Pack comes with a selection of signal chains designed to work on any melodic instrument Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be it piano, organ, flute or guitar. But of course Ã¢â‚¬â€œ any setting can be applied on whatever audio source you may have. A richly saturated guitar preset might just be the perfect fit for your piano. Or a daunting, backward vocal effect may very well be exactly what you wanted for your bass drum. It's just a matter of picking, choosing and being creative.\n\nSweeping pads, flanged reverbs, slow, dwindling echoes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this truly is an inspiring set of tools that will add an instant new layer of creativity to any colorful, emotive or artistic expression.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (03).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410a4cb9f44f2ce96cf4f2615ffd92f57e7e8647","amp;dn":"Toontrack+EZmix+Ambient+Pack+v1.0.0+-+OS+X+-+R2R+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410a4cb9f44f2ce96cf4f2615ffd92f57e7e8647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,10,76,185,244,79,44,233,108,244,242,97,95,253,146,245,126,126,134,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
