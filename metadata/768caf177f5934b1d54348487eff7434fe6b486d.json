On Kind Hearted Woman, she goes back home ? to a harsh landscape where she faces death, loneliness and a profound sadness that is as old as the Dust Bowl.\n\nThe bad times begin with \\\\\\&quot;Stillborn,\\\\\\&quot; in which Shocked captures in raw, chilling tones the picture of a mother cradling her dead child. In the spare, rocking \\\\\\&quot;Homestead,\\\\\\&quot; a widowed prairie woman deals with the daily traumas of isolation and chicken thieves. Shocked\\\\\\&amp;#039;s flair for emotional detail surfaces amid the loose R&amp;B groove of \\\\\\&quot;Cold Comfort\\\\\\&quot;; in the wake of a murder, she declares, \\\\\\&quot;It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a fact of life that we learn to live again.\\\\\\&quot;\n\nThe up-tempo half of Kind Hearted Woman, buoyed by a band that includes members of Hothouse Flowers, doesn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t cut quite as deep. But this album is easily Shocked\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most potent collection since the 1986 field recording The Texas Campfire Tapes, which propelled her beyond the folk circuit. Originally developed as a collaboration with choreographer Mark Morris, Kind Hearted Woman intimately captures the roughhewed essence of Shocked\\\\\\&amp;#039;s live persona.
