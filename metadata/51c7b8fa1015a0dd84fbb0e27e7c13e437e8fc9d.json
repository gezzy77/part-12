But as any Pixies fan will tell you, and as Doolittle suggests (like &quot;ten million pounds of sludge&quot; to the head), the Pixies rocked harder than the sum of their parts. They were masters of dynamics (check out &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven,&quot; or &quot;Hey&quot;), moving from quietly subdued to all-out head-banging and back before you could say &quot;la la love you.&quot; Black Francis was one of the most unique vocal stylists of the '80s. His duets with bassist Deal, &quot;I Bleed&quot; and &quot;Silver,&quot; work the way Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong worked together. And it's still staggering how much Joey Santiago, lead guitarist, could accomplish with one simple, single note. &quot;Here Comes Your Man,&quot; by the way, is as straightforwardly poppy as the Pixies ever got, so enjoy it. --Dan Leone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c7b8fa1015a0dd84fbb0e27e7c13e437e8fc9d","amp;dn":"Pixies+-+Doolittle+%7BMFSL+SACD+HYBRID%7D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51c7b8fa1015a0dd84fbb0e27e7c13e437e8fc9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,199,184,250,16,21,160,221,132,251,176,226,126,124,19,228,55,232,252,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
