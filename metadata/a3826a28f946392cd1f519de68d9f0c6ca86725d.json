Though early on categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a lone genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company. \n\nOn 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career. Arnaert wants to focus on her solo career and has been working on solo material for a few months. The last concert of Hooverphonic took place on 13 December 2008 in Ekaterinburg, Russia. \n\n=======================================================================================================================\n\nA New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular (1996)  - Review by Allmusic (3/5 stars)\n\nA New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular is the first album by the Belgian band Hooverphonic when the band was only known as Hoover. It was the only album with singer Liesje Sadonius. The song &quot;2 Wicky&quot; was featured in the movies Stealing Beauty by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Permanent Midnight. It is based on a loop from Isaac Hayes' cover of the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned &quot;Walk On By.&quot; The singles released from this album are &quot;2 Wicky&quot;, &quot;Wardrope&quot;, &quot;Barabas&quot; and &quot;Inhaler&quot;. The album's title, A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular, is also the catchphrase of the iconic Japanese Shibuya-kei band Pizzicato Five.\n\nThe original members of the group were vocalist Liesje Sadonius, keyboardist Frank DuchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªne, bassist Alex Callier, and guitarist Raymond Geerts. The band achieved international recognition through the inclusion of the track &quot;2Wicky&quot; (from A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular) on the soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film Stealing Beauty. &quot;2Wicky&quot; also appeared on the soundtracks of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Heights. The track's main riff is sampled from Isaac Hayes' recording of the 1960s hit Walk on By.\n\nSadonius left Hooverphonic on amicable terms shortly after the release of A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular. Kyoko Baertsoen, singer for fellow Belgian trip-hop band Lunascape, filled in for Sadonius for three months of a European tour in 1997 before Geike Arnaert was made the permanent singer in early 1998. Additional session musicians: Eric Bosteels was a session drummer with Hooverphonic from 1997-98, replaced by Mario Goossens until 2005. David Poltrock was keyboard player from the group on-and-off from 1998 until 2005. In 1998 Hooverphonic contributed to the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses, with their cover of &quot;Shake the Disease.&quot;\n\n01 &quot;Inhaler&quot; (Alex Callier, Raymond Geerts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n02 &quot;2 Wicky&quot; (Callier, Geerts, B.
