A Lamp In The Dark DVD is an exciting documentary showing the intriguing history of the Bible, the most blood-stained book in history! You enter into a world of saints and martyrs batting against spies, assassins and wolves in sheep\\'s clothing.\n\nThis DVD unfolds the fascinating \\'untold\\' history of the Bible. Reveals critical information often overlooked in modern histories.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Catholic Popes and the Inquistion forbade Biblical translation, threatening imprisonment and death to those who disobeyed this edict. Learn about the sacrifice of men like John Wyclife, Martin Luther, William Tyndale, Myles Coverdale and others, who hazarded their lives to communicate the Bible in languages which the common people could understand.\n\nCan This Be The Key to Understanding? With the fall of Constantinople, ancient Greek manuscripts came into Europe, and with them, the clear streams of understanding that produced the Protestant Reformation. But what few people have ever heard, is that Rome launched a Counter Reformation, fully intending that they would destroy all the works of the Reformers. This is the key to the \\'untold history\\' of the Bible. It is possible, even probable, that this ancient war on the Word of God continues to this day!\n\nFilled with rich visual graphics and dramatic re-enactments of key historic events\n\nDivX 3 hours 720 x 540 29 Fps 1200Kbps\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00793485910e777f53517a4fbade0a7f2945df7","amp;dn":"A+Lamp+In+The+Dark+-+The+Untold+History+Of+The+Bible+-+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00793485910e777f53517a4fbade0a7f2945df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,7,147,72,89,16,231,119,245,53,23,164,251,173,224,167,242,148,93,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
