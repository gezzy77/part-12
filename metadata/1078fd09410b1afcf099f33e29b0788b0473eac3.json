What distinguished netwar is the networked organizational structure of its practitioners and their quickness in coming together in swarming attacks. To confront this new type of conflict, it is crucial for governments, military, and law enforcement to begin networking themselves.\n\nFrom the Publisher: \n\nThe fight for the future makes daily headlines. Its battles are notbetween the armies of leading states, nor are its weapons the large,expensive tanks, planes and fleets of regular armed forces. Rather, thecombatants come from bomb-making terrorist groups like Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda, drug smuggling cartels like those in Colombia and Mexico, and militant anarchists like the Black Bloc that ran amok during the Battle of Seattle. Other protagonists are civil-society activists fighting fordemocracy and human rights-from Burma to the Balkans. What all have incommon is that they operate in small, dispersed units that can deployniimbly-anywhere, anytime. They know how to penetrate and disrupt, as well as elude and evade. All feature network forms of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the information age. And, from the Intifadah to the drug war, they are proving very hard to beat; some may actually be winning. This is the story we have to tell. \n\nPublisher \tRAND Corporation; 1 edition (November 5, 2001)\nLanguage \tEnglish\nISBN-10 \t0833030302\nISBN-13 \t978-0833030306\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Networks-Netwars-Future-Terror-Militancy/dp/0833030302/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372860212&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=networks+and+netwars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Networks-Netwars-Future-Terror-Militancy/dp/0833030302/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372860212&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=networks+and+netwars&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1078fd09410b1afcf099f33e29b0788b0473eac3","amp;dn":"Networks+and+Netwars%3A+The+Future+of+Terror%2C+Crime%2C+and+Militancy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1078fd09410b1afcf099f33e29b0788b0473eac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,120,253,9,65,11,26,252,240,153,243,62,41,176,120,139,4,115,234,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
