Alongside this lifestyle, depression rates have skyrocketed: approximately 1 in 4 Americans will suffer from major depression at some point in their lives. Where have we gone wrong? Dr. Stephen Ilardi sheds light on our current predicament and reminds us: our bodies were never designed for the sleep-deprived, poorly nourished, frenzied pace of twenty-first century life. In fact, our genes have changed very little since the days of our hunter-gatherer ancestors and are still building, in effect, Stone Age bodies. Herein lies the key to breaking the cycle of depression.\n\nInspired by the extraordinary resilience of aboriginal groups like the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea (who rarely suffer from depression), Dr. Ilardi prescribes an easy-to-follow, clinically proven program that harks back to what our bodies were originally made forÃ¢â‚¬â€and need. Here you can find the road back to lasting health by integrating the following 6 elements into your life: an omegaÃ¢â‚¬â€œ3 rich diet; exercise; plenty of natural sunlight; ample sleep; social connections; and participation in meaningful tasks that leave little time for negative thoughtsÃ¢â‚¬â€all things that our ancestors had in abundance.\n\nAlready, The Depression Cure program has delivered dramatic results, helping even those who have failed to respond to traditional medications. Interweaving the stories of many who have foughtÃ¢â‚¬â€and wonÃ¢â‚¬â€the battle against this debilitating illness, this groundbreaking book can illuminate the path to lifting the fog once and for all for you or a loved one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779e8b7975c85390b0b55d17868442e04bf0f77b","amp;dn":"The+Depression+Cure+-+Stephen+S.+Ilardi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779e8b7975c85390b0b55d17868442e04bf0f77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,158,139,121,117,200,83,144,176,181,93,23,134,132,66,224,75,240,247,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
