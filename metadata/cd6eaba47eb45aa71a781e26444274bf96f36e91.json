Earlier records have the wide-screen psychedelic sound of first-wave desert rock, with occasional impulses toward pop mitigated by the limitations of shambolic vocalist Dan Stuart. Later records suggest a kind of broke-down American Rolling Stones. Others have called them the bastard children of Neil Young.\n\n&quot;Green on Red's second offering from 1983 is something of a classic even by their high standards and considering mainstay and blues-rock empressario Chuck Prophet had yet to join! With honky-tonk piano, gutsy hard rocking blues and some Gram Parson's inspired country melancholy thrown in Green on Red created a gumbo stew of skewed and slanted barfly brilliance. With more than a nod to the Stones, Neil Young and The Doors the band sound unbelievably confident and assured on this outstanding collection of songs from the darker side of (low)life. \n\nOutstanding tracks like 'Brave Generation' take a sharp swipe at Reagan's corporate double-speak while 'Cheap Wine' and 'Narcolepsy' create the kind of whiskey drunk fumes Tom Waits would be proud of! As one of the luminaries of the short-lived 'Paisley Underground' this is one of that 'movements' finest hours ranking alongside Dream Syndicate's 'Days of Wines &amp; Roses' and the Long Ryders' Native Sons'. It's pure unashamed Americana from a time when Duran Duran ruled the airways but unlike the emptiness of their New Romantic slush Gravity Talks sounds timeless and as vital today as it did 25 years ago. \n\nBuy it, borrow it, steal it if for nothing else to hear the incredible riffing splendour of 'Abigail's Ghost', a song so brilliant it should be ranked with Stones' classics like 'Jumping Jack Flash' and 'Brown Sugar' -it's so good that even when the band played it live as a slow blues it was mesmerising&quot;.\n\n  01.
