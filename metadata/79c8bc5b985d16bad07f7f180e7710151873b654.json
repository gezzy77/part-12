It offers guidelines, procedures, frameworks and technology for actually setting up a safety and security culture in a cluster of chemical companies, thus allowing forward planning. The presentation is conceptually rather than mathematically oriented so as to maximize its utilization within the chemical industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79c8bc5b985d16bad07f7f180e7710151873b654","amp;dn":"Multi-Plant+Safety+and+Security+Management+in+the+Chemical+and+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79c8bc5b985d16bad07f7f180e7710151873b654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,200,188,91,152,93,22,186,208,127,127,24,14,119,16,21,24,115,182,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
