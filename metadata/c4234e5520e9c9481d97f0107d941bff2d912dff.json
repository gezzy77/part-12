But even a small-town girl can have big dreams, and Rosalee\\&amp;#039;s is to someday--somehow--meet her big-screen idol Tad Hamilton. The somehow arrives in the form of a contest--the grand prize: a date with Tad Hamilton--and the someday is now. Rosalee wins, much to the chagrin of her best friend and co-worker Pete, who is deeply, hopelessly--and secretly--in love with Rosalee. The Win a Date contest was cooked up by Tad\\&amp;#039;s agent, Richard Levy, and his manager, also named Richard Levy, to clean up Tad\\&amp;#039;s bad-boy image. Someone should have told them to be careful what you wish for. When Tad meets Rosalee and gets a taste of what he\\&amp;#039;s been missing in the real world, he decides he wants seconds and moves to West Virginia, turning Rosalee\\&amp;#039;s dream come true into a nightmare for Richard Levy, Richard Levy and, most of all, Pete.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4234e5520e9c9481d97f0107d941bff2d912dff","amp;dn":"Win+a+Date+with+Tad+Hamilton.DVDRip.XviD-PePPage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4234e5520e9c9481d97f0107d941bff2d912dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,35,78,85,32,233,201,72,29,151,240,16,125,148,27,255,45,145,45,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
