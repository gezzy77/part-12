This box set features every one if his studio recordings he made from 1949 to his unfortunate plane crash on July 31, 1964. The set also features some rare demos and some previously unissued versions of songs such as Danny Boy, Missing Angel, What Would You Do, etc. The only low points on this box set are Jim's early Abbot recordings, but disc 4 through 16 are definitely worth listening to. Best of all, it features Jim Afrikaan songs which I know you will love. You won't be disappointed if you get this set.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1396c03742ba75b7dfc01970d99e8eca011e73","amp;dn":"Jim+Reeves+-+Welcome+to+My+World+%281994%2F160kbps%29++%5B16+CD+Set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1396c03742ba75b7dfc01970d99e8eca011e73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,19,150,192,55,66,186,117,183,223,192,25,112,217,158,142,202,1,30,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
