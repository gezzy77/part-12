This is the 2D version.\n\nThe first 3-D motion picture produced by a major studio, Man in the Dark (1953) is a classic film noir, complete with tough-guy protagonist (Edmond OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Brien), heart-of-gold moll (Audrey Totter), and plenty of underworld actionÃ¢â‚¬â€but with handsome stereoscopic imagery directed by the prolific Lew Landers. \n\nSturdy noir regular Edmond O'Brien and Audrey Totter, one of noir's most distinctive dames.\n\nMan in the Dark stars Edmond O'Brien as Steve Rawley, a man with a past. Thing of it is, Rawley knows nothing about that past: a former gangster, he underwent an operation that not only altered his appearance, but also wiped out all criminal tendencies--not to mention all memory of his past misdeeds. \n\nRawley is kidnapped by his former mob cohorts, who demand that he cough up the $130,000 that he salted away during his gangster days. Audrey Totter co-stars as Peg Benedict, who loves Rawley for what he is, not what he was.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 3.52b\nDuration.... 01:58:16\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 960\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 7309kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate....164kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518f13fb9b622d13ae07b148bbbf1e11f7c449da","amp;dn":"Man+In+The+Dark+1953+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518f13fb9b622d13ae07b148bbbf1e11f7c449da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,143,19,251,155,98,45,19,174,7,177,72,187,191,30,17,247,196,73,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
