Moby Dick\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nA pretty good show, but the band seems to be a bit tired after the last night. \r\nWorth having for A great version of Celebration Day with Jones' bass going nuts. Plant asking the audience to being quiet during acoustic set: &quot;Listen. It realy amazes me, because anybody who's been to England knows that when you go to a concert, there's such a thing as listening to what's going on! Unfortunately, we're faced with the problem in our free society where a lot of people come to listen, and there's a lot of people who are making a racket so nobody hears what's going on. We've got some things to say but every time I go to open my mouth, there's another spokesman ... If the guy next to you is trying to listen, you've got to respect that and be quiet&quot;. So the whole thing's a bit circular respect thing. So many of those big festivals felt apartbecause the respect wasn't a uniform one, and the thing with these concerts is that they normally are!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea95f2c2985162d39d4a35bbd2c9ff4f29e8d82b","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1971.09.04+Toronto%2C+Canada+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea95f2c2985162d39d4a35bbd2c9ff4f29e8d82b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,149,242,194,152,81,98,211,157,74,53,187,210,201,255,79,41,232,216,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
