New information is always coming in, and it's messy and inconsistent. Text files, Excel spreadsheets, web forms, email messages, and so on. You'd like to find a way to format it into something clean and consistent you can use in a database, and you'd like to automate that process as much as possible. Enter AWK, a command-line tool for Mac, Unix, and Linux that allows you to manipulate data in powerful ways.\n\nIn this course, award-winning author and teacher David D. Levine shows you how to use AWK to read and write data in a variety of formats, produce reports, and automate repetitive tasks. He reviews the nuts and bolts of the language, such as field separators, pattern matching, variables, operators, expressions, and control structures; functions available for manipulating data; and integration with other programs like Excel.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is AWK?\n    Writing an AWK program\n    Working with records, fields, patterns, and actions\n    Specifying field and record separators with variables\n    Using built-in and user-defined variables\n    Building control structures\n    Formatting output\n    Manipulating string data with functions\n    Scripting with AWK\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7b3eabb61419f2e5e42cf76204003e9b5ab347","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+AWK+Essential+Training+with+David+D.Levine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7b3eabb61419f2e5e42cf76204003e9b5ab347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,123,62,171,182,20,25,242,229,228,44,247,98,4,0,62,155,90,179,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
