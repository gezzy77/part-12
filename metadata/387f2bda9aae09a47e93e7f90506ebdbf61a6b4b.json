The Remnant of Israel: The History, Theology, and Philosophy of the Messianic Jewish Community, is an update on the growing and diversifying community of Jews who have found favor with God by receiving Jesus as Messiah. Written by a Messianic Jew for Jew and Gentile alike, here is an articulate survey of the biblical position of the Messianic Jew in the setting of community. Dr. Fruchtenbaum again assesses how this community is distinctive and how it relates to the Jewish people, the Law of Moses, the local church, the State of Israel, missions, and many other timely topics. The rapid growth of the Messianic Jewish community has provoked interest as well as offense. Here is what is happening in the lives of Messianic Jews and how they and their movement relate their faith to the rest of the world.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Upon graduating from high school, Arnold was forced by his father to leave home because of his faith. In 1962, he began undergraduate education at Shelton College in New Jersey. Transferring to Ohio's Cedarville College, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hebrew and Greek in 1966. He then moved to Israel, where he studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. During this time, he witnessed the historic Six-Day War in 1967. Later that year, Arnold returned to the U.S. and entered Dallas Theological Seminary for studies in Hebrew and Old Testament. He also began working as a missionary with ABMJ (today, Chosen People Ministries)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387f2bda9aae09a47e93e7f90506ebdbf61a6b4b","amp;dn":"The+Remnant+Of+Israel+-+Arnold+Fruchtenbaum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387f2bda9aae09a47e93e7f90506ebdbf61a6b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,127,43,218,154,174,9,164,126,147,231,249,5,6,235,219,246,26,107,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
