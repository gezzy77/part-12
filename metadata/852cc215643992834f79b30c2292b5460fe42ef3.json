In this dramatic account of the final days before the outbreak of World War II, award-winning historian Richard Overy vividly chronicles the unraveling of peace, hour by grim hour, as politicians and ordinary citizens brace themselves for a war that could spell the end of European civilization.\n\nWritten by Richard Overy \nRead by Simon Prebble","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852cc215643992834f79b30c2292b5460fe42ef3","amp;dn":"1939%3A+Countdown+to+War+by+Richard+Overy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852cc215643992834f79b30c2292b5460fe42ef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,44,194,21,100,57,146,131,79,121,179,12,34,146,181,70,15,228,46,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
