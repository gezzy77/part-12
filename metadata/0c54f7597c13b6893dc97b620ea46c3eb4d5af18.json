The student body at Greendale Community College is made up of high-school losers, newly divorced housewives, and old people who want to keep their minds active. Within these not-so-hallowed halls, Community focuses on a band of misfits, at the center of which is a fast-talkin' lawyer whose degree has been revoked (Joel McHale), who form a study group and end up learning a lot more about themselves than they do about their course work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c54f7597c13b6893dc97b620ea46c3eb4d5af18","amp;dn":"Community.S05E05.HDTV-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c54f7597c13b6893dc97b620ea46c3eb4d5af18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,84,247,89,124,19,182,137,61,201,123,98,14,164,108,62,180,213,175,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
