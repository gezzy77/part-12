He also philosophizes that greed is unrelenting because it's really a search for spiritual fulfillment and cannot be satisfied through the accumulation of material possessions. His anecdotal format results in an entertaining book, while his scary stories of the effect of greed almost make the reader glad not to be rich.\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ea1f3fea101330be87733cf323b207dc2ce441e","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Book+of+Greed+-+The+strange+History+of+Human+Excess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ea1f3fea101330be87733cf323b207dc2ce441e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,161,243,254,161,1,51,11,232,119,51,207,50,59,32,125,194,206,68,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
