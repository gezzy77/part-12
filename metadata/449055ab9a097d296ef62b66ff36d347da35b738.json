Searchable (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc. Many thanks to the original scanners. The EPUB files seem to be either retail or retail-quality (as far as I can tell), or good quality amateur versions (e.g., Women and Men), and the MOBI files are my conversions via calibre.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n\nJoseph McElroy (born 1930) is an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist. He is noted for writing difficult fiction. McElroy's writing is often grouped with that of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon, due to the encyclopedic quality of his novels, particularly the 1,192 pages of Women and Men (1987). His short fiction was first published in literary journals. Echoes of McElroy's work can be found in that of Don DeLillo and David Foster Wallace. McElroy's work often reflects a preoccupation with how science functions in American society.\n\nWikipedia has some other interesting info about McElroy and some useful links.\n\n----\n\nNote: This torrent is an attempt to recreate and enlarge a previous Joseph McElroy torrent that never seeded. But I added two more books not in that torrent and reprocessed the PDF files myself. Some of the EPUB files in that torrent were extremely large and would probably not have been readable in any case -- I suspect they were not true EPUBs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:449055ab9a097d296ef62b66ff36d347da35b738","amp;dn":"Joseph+McElroy+-+Literary+Fiction+%287+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"449055ab9a097d296ef62b66ff36d347da35b738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,144,85,171,154,9,125,41,110,246,43,102,255,54,211,71,218,53,183,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
