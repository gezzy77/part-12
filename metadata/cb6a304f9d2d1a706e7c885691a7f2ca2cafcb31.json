He has sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has amassed 22 Top 40 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most tracks by a solo artist to hit number-one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with eight. Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of Farm Aid, an organization that began in 1985 with a star-studded concert in Champaign, Illinois to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. The Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 24 years, and as of 2009 the organization has raised more than $33 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture.\n\nMellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 10, 2008, by Billy Joel.[1] His biggest musical influences are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie and The Rolling Stones. In early July 2009, Mellencamp will embark on a two-month tour of minor league ballparks with Dylan and Willie Nelson.\n\n\n\n\n\nChestnut Street Incident 1976\n\n\nChestnut Street Incident is the debut album by Johnny Cougar, later known as John Mellencamp, released in 1976 (see 1976 in music).\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;American Dream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21 \n2.\t&quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; (Bill Dees, Orbison) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54 \n3.\t&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11 \n4.\t&quot;Dream Killing Town&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n5.\t&quot;Supergirl&quot; (Aldo Legui, Bob Marcus) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37 \n6.\t&quot;Chestnut Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18 \n7.\t&quot;Good Girls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09 \n8.\t&quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot; (John Sebastian) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38 \n9.\t&quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; (Densmore/Krieger/Manzarek/Morrison) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14 \n10.\t&quot;Chestnut Street Revisited&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22 \n11.\t&quot;Sad Lady&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26 \n12.\t&quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; (Percy Mayfield)* [bonus] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32 \n13.\t&quot;I Need Somebody Baby&quot; (Iggy Pop/James Williamson)* [bonus] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n\n\n\n\n\nA Biography 1978\n\n\nA Biography is John Mellencamp's third album, and the final album credited to &quot;Johnny Cougar.&quot; Due to poor sales of Mellencamp's previous two efforts, A Biography did not receive a U.S. release upon its 1978 debut. It was, however, released stateside in 2005. In Australia, however, &quot;I Need a Lover&quot; became a huge hit, with the result that Mellencamp's career, apparently a failure, got its first start.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Born Reckless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n2.\t&quot;Factory&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \n3.\t&quot;Night Slumming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36 \n4.\t&quot;Taxi Dancer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n5.\t&quot;I Need a Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37 \n6.\t&quot;Alley of the Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n7.\t&quot;High C Cherrie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 \n8.\t&quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \n9.\t&quot;Let Them Run Your Lives&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55 \n10.\t&quot;Goodnight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20 \n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Cougar \n\n\nJohn Cougar is the fourth album by John Cougar. Released in 1979, following the Australian success of &quot;I Need A Lover&quot; from the previous year's A Biography (which did not receive a U.S. release), the album included the aforementioned track for U.S. audiences, as well as a re-working of A Biography's &quot;Taxi Dancer.&quot;\n\n&quot;I Need A Lover&quot;, upon the release of this album, became a hit in the US as well as in Australia, where &quot;Miami&quot; became his second Top 40 hit. &quot;I Need A Lover&quot; was subsequently covered by Pat Benatar on her album In the Heat of the Night. In the US, however, &quot;Small Paradise&quot; was released as a single in place of &quot;Miami,&quot; but was not very successful.\n\nTracks\n\n1.\t&quot;A Little Night Dancin'&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n2.\t&quot;Small Paradise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n3.\t&quot;Miami&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n4.\t&quot;Great Mid-west&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29 \n5.\t&quot;Do You Think That's Fair&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48 \n6.\t&quot;I Need a Lover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35 \n7.\t&quot;Welcome to Chinatown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n8.\t&quot;Sugar Marie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n9.\t&quot;Pray for Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30 \n10.\t&quot;Taxi Dancer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 \n \n\n\n\n\nNothinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Matters and What if it Did 1980\n\n\nNothin' Matters And What If It Did is John Mellencamp's fifth album, under his pseudonym of John Cougar. It includes the moderate hits &quot;Ain't Even Done With The Night&quot;, which reached No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and &quot;This Time&quot;, which reached No. 27. Edith Massey is the woman on the cover.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hot Night In A Cold Town&quot; (Geoffrey Cushing-Murray, Richard Littlefield) - 3:47 \n2.\t&quot;Ain't Even Done With The Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38 \n3.\t&quot;Don't Misunderstand Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n4.\t&quot;This Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n5.\t&quot;Make Me Feel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n6.\t&quot;To M.G.

It was intended to be the follow-up to his debut album Chestnut Street Incident, but MCA declined to release the album and dropped Mellencamp from the label. The recordings remained on the shelf until 1983 when Tony DeFries, Mellencamp's former manager, released the album on his own MainMan label. DeFries was attempting to capitalize on the recent success of Mellencamp's breakout album American Fool, which had sold over two million copies and spawned two #1 singles.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Kid Inside&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:32 \n2.\t&quot;Take What You Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14 \n3.\t&quot;Cheap Shot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n4.\t&quot;Sidewalk and Streetlights&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n5.\t&quot;R.

It was Mellencamp's seventh album and the first in which he used his real last name. Uh-Huh contained three Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 hits: &quot;Crumblin' Down&quot; (#9), &quot;Authority Song&quot; (#15), and &quot;Pink Houses&quot; ( # 8 ) In 1989, it was ranked #32 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Crumblin' Down&quot; (George Green, Mellencamp) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n2.\t&quot;Pink Houses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43 \n3.\t&quot;Authority Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \n4.\t&quot;Warmer Place to Sleep&quot; (Green, Mellencamp) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48 \n5.\t&quot;Jackie O&quot; (Mellencamp, John Prine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04 \n6.\t&quot;Play Guitar&quot; (Larry Crane, Mellencamp, Dan Ross) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25 \n7.\t&quot;Serious Business&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25 \n8.\t&quot;Lovin' Mother fo Ya&quot; (Will Cary, Mellencamp) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n9.\t&quot;Golden Gates&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n10.\t&quot;Pink Houses&quot; (acoustic version, 2005 re-issue bonus track) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 \n\n\n\n\n\nScarecrow  1985\n\n\nScarecrow is the 8th album released by John Mellencamp in August 1985. Released on Mercury Records, it peaked at #2 on the U.S. charts. It was remastered and reissued on Mercury Records on May 24, 2005, with one bonus track.\n\nThis album contained three Top 10 hits, a record for a Mellencamp album. They were &quot;R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,&quot; which peaked at #2 in the U.S., &quot;Lonely Ol' Night,&quot; which peaked at #6, and &quot;Small Town,&quot; which also peaked at #6. &quot;Lonely Ol' Night&quot; also peaked at #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, his second chart-topping single on this chart. In 1989, it was ranked #95 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Rain on the Scarecrow&quot; (Mellencamp, George M.

It has considerable country and folk music influences, including the use of steel guitar, violins, accordion and hammond organ. It contained a number of hit singles, including &quot;Paper in Fire&quot; (Mainstream Rock #1, Hot 100 #9) and &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; (Mainstream Rock #1, Hot 100 #8 ).\n\nThe lyrics are a mix of social comment and reflection, and nostalgic descriptions of younger life and the process of maturing. &quot;Paper in Fire&quot; is a cautionary tale concerned with the cost of chasing our dreams. &quot;Down and Out in Paradise&quot; chronicles a series of stories of economic and social hardship as if told to the President, who at the time was Ronald Reagan. &quot;Check It Out&quot; is a commentary on day to day existence that fosters the hope that future generations will understand better how to live. &quot;The Real Life&quot; continues the these of concern about the way lives are lived, and includes two vignettes of the lives of &quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;Jackson Jackson.&quot; &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; is a nostalgic but fundamentally happy review of the narrators life - &quot;we were young and we were improving.&quot; &quot;We Are the People&quot; lists categories of people - the homeless, the oppressed, people in pain - against the refrain &quot;May my thoughts be with you.&quot; Unemployment and its effect on the narrator and his wife Maryanne, is the subject of &quot;Empty Hands.&quot; &quot;Hard Times For An Honest Man&quot; continues the existential theme, noting, against a backdrop of two more cautionary tales, that &quot;the rent we pay to stay here gets high.&quot; &quot;Hotdogs and Hamburgers&quot; addresses the question of right and wrong, and the need for personal choice, within a narrative describing the a lift given to an Indian girl on Route 66. &quot;Rooty Toot Toot,&quot; like &quot;Cherry Bomb,&quot; is a happy nostalgic tale of the narrator's youth. Mellencamp originally wrote the song as a nursery rhyme for his daughter, Teddi Jo, who had asked her father to use her name in one of his songs. After it was written, Mellencamp and his band turned &quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; into a rock song.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Paper in Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51 \n2.\t&quot;Down and Out in Paradise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 \n3.\t&quot;Check It Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19 \n4.\t&quot;The Real Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 \n5.\t&quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47 \n6.\t&quot;We Are the People&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 \n7.\t&quot;Empty Hands&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n8.\t&quot;Hard Times For An Honest Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n9.\t&quot;Hotdogs and Hamburgers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04 \n10.\t&quot;Rooty Toot Toot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29 \n \n\n\n\n\nBig Daddy 1989\n\n\nBig Daddy is the tenth studio album by John Mellencamp, released in 1989 by Mercury Records. It was his last album to be released under the name John Cougar Mellencamp, a combination of his real name and his original stage name of Johnny Cougar. The album peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and contained the singles &quot;Pop Singer&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; which peaked at number fifteen and forty eight respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. A re-mastered version of the album was released on May 24, 2005, and contains a bonus acoustic version of Jackie Brown. Like The Lonesome Jubilee, Big Daddy is folk-inspired as violins and fiddles (among other instruments) are significantly utilized on a number of tracks. The album's lyrics largely take a serious tone and the album as a whole is regarded by some as Mellencamp's most reflective.\n\nMellencamp continues his pattern of social commentary used on The Lonesome Jubilee on a number of tracks on the album. &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; addresses the issue of poverty and stimulates images of the hardships faced by those living in poverty. A lyric in the song's final verse which reads &quot;...But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown? Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his&quot; seems to indicate that Mellencamp believes the issue of poverty to be correlated to the general public and the reluctance to show interest in developing resolutions. &quot;Country Gentleman&quot; is another social commentary addressing Ronald Reagan's presidency and policies. In the song, Mellencamp continually states that it is not Reagan's interest to help the poor, but rather only his &quot;rich friends&quot;. &quot;J.M.'s Question&quot; is a broad social commentary addressing many diverse issues prevalent in the United States including the contamination of the environment and violence stemming from the constitutional right to bear arms among other issues. &quot;Void In My Heart&quot; is reflective song regarding Mellencamp's position as an acclaimed singer and as one who has worked hard to make it but still he confesses &quot;There's a void in my heart I can't seem to fill&quot;. &quot;Big Daddy of Them All&quot; is the account of a parental authority figure whose selfish womanizing ways have led to his downfall. &quot;Martha Say&quot; is an account of a stubbornly independent woman whose ways lead Mellencamp to caution her to &quot;look out&quot;. The album takes a less serious tone on two tracks, the first of which titled &quot;Pop Singer&quot; is a clarification of Mellencamp's identity (he sings that he &quot;never wanted to be no pop singer&quot; ). The song seems to describe Mellencamp's evolution from a young man who was manipulated by former manager Tony DeFries in the late 1970s into a strong-minded, independent musician. Let It All Hang Out&quot; is the second less serious song and is a cover of the Hombres; it was unlisted on the original album's packaging.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Big Daddy Of Them All&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 \n2.\t&quot;To Live&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18 \n3.\t&quot;Martha Say&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n4.\t&quot;Theo And Weird Henry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 \n5.\t&quot;Jackie Brown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n6.\t&quot;Pop Singer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48 \n7.\t&quot;Void In My Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30 \n8.\t&quot;Mansions In Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 \n9.\t&quot;Sometimes A Great Notion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n10.\t&quot;Country Gentleman&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17 \n11.\t&quot;J.M.'s Question&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n12.\t&quot;Let It All Hang Out&quot; (B.B.

Released on Mercury Records, it peaked at #7 on the Billboard 200. The single &quot;What If I Came Knocking&quot; was Mellencamp's last #1 single on the Album Rock Tracks chart, staying atop for two weeks in the summer of 1993.\n\nThe album is dedicated to band member John Cascella, who died unexpectedly about halfway through production.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;When Jesus Left Birmingham&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16 \n2.\t&quot;Junior&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n3.\t&quot;Human Wheels&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33 \n4.\t&quot;Beige to Beige&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \n5.\t&quot;Case 795 (The Family)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n6.\t&quot;Suzanne and the Jewels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n7.\t&quot;Sweet Evening Breeze&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51 \n8.\t&quot;What If I Came Knocking&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05 \n9.\t&quot;French Shoes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 \n10.\t&quot;To the River&quot; (Ian/Venzer/Mellencamp) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33 \n\n\n\n\n\nDance Naked 1994\n\n\nDance Naked is the 13th album by John Mellencamp released in 1994. The album was released in response to the record company's accusations that Mellencamp's previous album, Human Wheels, didn't &quot;fit the format.&quot; Mellencamp was irritated with this remark, feeling that none of his albums ever fit the format. As a result, he wrote several purposely radio-friendly songs and recorded them within the span of 14 days at the Belmont Mall Studio in Indiana, intending to show the lack of effort required to produce the type of album they were asking for.\n\nAlthough Mellencamp claims that Dance Naked was merely an easy output to give the company what it wanted, the album was still well received. The most notable accomplishment was the largely successful single &quot;Wild Night&quot;, a cover of the 1971 song by Van Morrison. The song featured Me'shell Ndegeocello on a duet with Mellencamp as well as the prominent bass lead. The single reached #3 on the Billboard Top 100 and charted at #1 on the Adult Contemporary List for 8 weeks. The album itself reached #13 on the Billboard 200 and produced several music videos: two versions for &quot;Wild Night&quot;, another for the title track &quot;Dance Naked&quot;, and two un-released videos for &quot;L.U.V.&quot; and &quot;Another Sunny Day 12/25&quot;.\n\nDance Naked was re-mastered and re-released on July 19, 2005, along with three other Mellencamp albums. The re-mastered edition includes an acoustic version of &quot;Wild Night&quot; as a bonus track.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Dance Naked&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00 \n2.\t&quot;Brothers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14 \n3.\t&quot;When Margaret Comes To Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n4.\t&quot;Wild Night&quot; (Van Morrison)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 \n5.\t&quot;L.U.V.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01 \n6.\t&quot;Another Sunny Day 12/25&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \n7.\t&quot;Too Much To Think About&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02 \n8.\t&quot;The Big Jack&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n9.\t&quot;The Breakout&quot; (Mellencamp/Green) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 \n10.\t&quot;Wild Night&quot; (2005 re-issue bonus track) - 3:19 \n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Happy Go Lucky 1996\n\n\nMr. Happy Go Lucky is a rock album released by John Mellencamp on September 10, 1996.

It was released on July 15, 2008. At the end of 2008, Rolling Stone magazine named Life, Death, Love and Freedom No. 5 on its list of the 50 best albums of the year. The song &quot;Troubled Land&quot; was number 48 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Singles of 2008\n\nMellencamp has characterized the album as a collection of &quot;modern electric folk songs.&quot; The album's first single was &quot;My Sweet Love,&quot; and it was serviced to radio on June 10, 2008. &quot;Troubled Land&quot; was the second single and was named by Rolling Stone magazine as the 48th best single of '08.\n\nQuotable:\n\n&quot;I realized our country has written some sad motherfuckin' songs. I wanted to see if I had it in me to write like that....I see darkness everywhere, and I have to write about it. I don't care if I just sell six records. All I can do is keep on writing songs and singing.&quot;\n\n- Mellencamp on Life, Death, Love and Freedom in Rolling Stone magazine's 2008 spring music preview issue.\n\nJena Controversy\n\nIn October 2007, &quot;Jena&quot; was released via Mellencamp's website and YouTube with a homemade quality music video. The song, about the Jena Six trial in Jena, Louisiana, has already proven controversial; it has been criticized by Jena's mayor, Murphy R. McMillan, who says it unfairly characterizes the town as a hotbed of racism. He also called the video &quot;inflammatory.&quot;[cite this quote]\n\nRelease\n\nLife, Death, Love and Freedom is the first album ever released that utilized the ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â§ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â¸ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ (CODE) process. T-Bone Burnett and his team of engineers developed CODE, a proprietary audio technology that creates high-definition audio files that are virtually indistinguishable from the original master tapes. The CODE version of &quot;Life, Death, Love and Freedom&quot; is a DVD that will come packaged with a standard CD version of the album, available at all retail outlets, at no additional cost to the consumer. The CODE disc is playable on virtually all DVD machines including stand-alone players and drives integrated into computer systems. The DVD's content can be copied into most computer music software including iTunes and can, then, be downloaded onto personal music players such as the iPod.\n\nMellencamp commented, &quot;When T-Bone introduced me to CODE, it was a remarkable experience. I could hear the music the way it was intended to be heard. I'm very happy the people are going to be able to share this experience in a way that's so true to our original intent.&quot;[cite this quote]\n\nThe album was named No. 38 in Q's 50 Best Albums of the Year 2008\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Longest Days&quot; - 3:11\n2. &quot;My Sweet Love&quot; - 3:27\n3. &quot;If I Die Sudden&quot; - 3:45\n4. &quot;Troubled Land&quot; - 3:23\n5. &quot;Young Without Lovers&quot; - 2:49\n6. &quot;John Cockers&quot; - 3:51\n7. &quot;Don't Need This Body&quot; - 3:26\n8. &quot;A Ride Back Home&quot; - 3:12\n9. &quot;Without A Shot&quot; - 3:40\n10. &quot;Jena&quot; - 3:41\n11. &quot;Mean&quot; - 2:34\n12. &quot;County Fair&quot; - 3:41\n13. &quot;For The Children&quot; - 4:36\n14. &quot;A Brand New Song&quot; - 3:58\n\n\n\n\nGREATEST HITS \n\nThe Best that I Could Do 1978 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1988  1997\n\n\nReleased after John Mellencamp signed with Columbia Records, The Best That I Could Do 1978ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1988 is Mellencamp's first hits album.
