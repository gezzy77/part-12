Primo Ramdisk supports up to 128 virtual disks. Each virtual disk can identify itself to Windows as a real physical hard disk or as a logical disk. It can be formatted with any Windows supported file system. Furthermore, Primo Ramdisk allows you to customize file system settings if necessary.\r\n\r\nPrimo Ramdisk also provides strong ability to rapidly save/restore ramdisk contents to/from an image file. Thus a ramdisk's contents can be preserved across computer restarts, in spite of the volatility of physical memory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Primo Ramdisk offers unique features to effectively and efficiently manage system memory. It is able to dynamically allocate or release system memory for ramdisks, making better use of memory. Primo Ramdisk also implements the Unified Invisible Memory Management Interface (UIMMI) to create ramdisks from Invisible Memory, thereby overcoming the Windows limits on amount of system memory and allowing all installed physical memory to be fully utilized.\r\n\r\nBesides ramdisks, Primo Ramdisk also supports to create hybrid-disks and file-disks, greatly extending its functionality.\r\n\r\nMain Feature List\r\n\r\nDisk Features\r\n\r\n- Supports ramdisk, hybrid-disk, and file-disk.\r\n- Supports SCSI disk, Direct-IO disk.\r\n- Supports one-time virtual disk.\r\n- Supports up to 128 virtual disks.\r\n\r\nMemory Features\r\n\r\n- Supports Dynamic Memory Management (DMM).\r\n- Supports Unified Invisible Memory Management Interface (UIMMI).\r\n- Supports to access memory above 4 GB.\r\n\r\nFile System Features\r\n\r\n- Supports FAT/FAT32/NTFS file systems.\r\n- Supports user-defined cluster size.\r\n- Supports user-defined volume label, serial number and drive letter.\r\n- Supports user-defined folders.\r\n- Supports user-defined NTFS file system settings (compression, indexing, and permission).\r\n\r\nImage File Features\r\n\r\n- Supports image file format: Plain/Smart/Compressed Image.\r\n- Supports load/save functions:\r\n- - Load Only, Save at Shutdown, Save Before Removal, Timing Save, Real-time Save, and Manual Save.\r\n- Supports Delay Load mode.\r\n- Supports Quick Save mode.\r\n\r\nOther Features\r\n\r\n- Supports system paging files.\r\n- Supports command line interface (CLI).\r\n- Supports multilingual user interface.\r\n- Integrates mini tools to easily utilize virtual disks.\r\n\r\nSupported Operating Systems\r\n\r\nAll versions of Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP, including x86 and x64 editions.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/primo-ramdisk/index.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b3c23e64b5b272910fa142d2b3317ba0b398cfc","amp;dn":"Primo+Ramdisk+Ultimate+Edition+5.6.0+Multilingual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b3c23e64b5b272910fa142d2b3317ba0b398cfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,60,35,230,75,91,39,41,16,250,20,45,43,51,23,186,11,57,140,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
