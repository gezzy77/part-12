Moon rocks that made you feel weightless. Jawbreakers that made you unbreakable. Or candy that gave animals temporary human intelligence and communication skills. (Imagine what your pet would say!) Four young friends, Nate, Summer, Trevor, and Pigeon, are befriended by Belinda White, the owner of a new candy shop on Main Street. However, the gray- haired, grandmotherly Mrs. White is not an ordinary candy maker. Her confections have magical side effects. Purposefully, she invites the kids on a special mission to retrieve a hidden talisman under Mt. Diablo Elementary School. However, Mrs. White is not the only magician in town in search of the ancient artifact rumored to be a fountain of youth. She is aware that Mr. Stott, the not- so- ordinary ice cream truck driver, has a few tricks of his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3703ad016a18af3bc255aa8aaa765faf778aeca","amp;dn":"The+Candy+Shop+War+%28The+Candy+Shop+War%2C+%231%29+-+Brandon+Mull","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3703ad016a18af3bc255aa8aaa765faf778aeca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,112,58,208,22,161,138,243,188,37,90,168,170,167,101,250,247,120,174,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
