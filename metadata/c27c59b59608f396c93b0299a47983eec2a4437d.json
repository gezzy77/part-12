As a rogue planet roars through our solar system, it acts as an intergalactic magnet that pulls Earth in its wake. Meteors destroy major cities. Fire and ice storms engulf the land. Casualties are in the millions. And as the situation grows even worse, Steve Lannon (Joe Lando of 'Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman') is determined to reunite with his wife (Michelle Stafford of 'The Young and the Restless' and 'General Hospital') and teenage daughter (Denyse Tontz of &quot;All My Children&quot;). But when they stumble into a secret government installation, they'll uncover a nuclear mission that will either blast our planet back into orbit or guarantee front row seats to the end of the world.\r\n\r\nDirector: Steven Daniels\r\nWriter: Colin Reese\r\nStars: Joe Lando, Michelle Stafford, Denyse Tontz\r\nGenres: Action | Sci-Fi\r\nCountry: USA | Canada\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Earthfall.2015.BRRip.XviD.AC3-EVO                                             \r\n\r\n SOURCE: RBG (720p) - Thanks!                                               \r\n\r\n ViDEO: 1800 kbps XviD               \r\n\r\n RESOLUTiON: 720x400                           \r\n\r\n RUNTiME: 1h28m33sec      \r\n\r\n SUBTiTLES: N/A                               \r\n\r\n AUDiO: 448 CBR AC-3        \r\n\r\n LANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\n GREETS: Srkfan &amp; AQOS \r\n \r\n NOTES: Enjoy.       \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/ascJ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/ascK \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/ascZ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/asce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c27c59b59608f396c93b0299a47983eec2a4437d","amp;dn":"Earthfall.2015.BRRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c27c59b59608f396c93b0299a47983eec2a4437d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,124,89,181,150,8,243,150,201,59,2,153,164,121,131,238,194,164,67,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
