The album finds the band turning up the amps and returning to the satisfying crunch with a mix of rock, punk, pop and classic country that defined the band s sound on earlier albums. The band credits the new album s enthusiasm to their return to their hometown of Dallas, TX to record, the first time since their initial independent release. The band, still comprised of original members Rhett Miller, Murry Hammond, Ken Bethea and Philip Peeples, deliver what they believe is the finest album of their 15-year career.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nARTIST     : The Old 97s\nTITLE      : Blame It On Gravity\nLABEL      : New West Records\nGENRE      : Rock\nBITRATE    : 194 kbps avg\nSOURCE     : CD (LP)\nPLAYTIME   : 00:46:17\nSIZE       : 68.1MB\nSTORE DATE : 2008-05-00\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n1.

(Old 97s) will be releasing their first\nstudio album since 2004&amp;#039;s Drag It Up on May 13 via New West Records.\nThe album is titled Blame It On Gravity and according to their label\nfinds the band &quot;turning up the amps and returning to the satisfying\ncrunch&quot; of their early year.\nHere&amp;#039;s a few words regarding the sound of the new album from the band&amp;#039;s\nMyspace page: Some bands blast out of the gate and never recapture their\nearly energy. Other bands establish themselves as models of consistency.\nStill other bands take a while to find themselves. And then there are\nbands like the Old 97s, who blast out of the gate, establish themselves\nas models of consistency, take a while to find themselves, and then,\nfifteen years in, deliver a glorious record that sums up everything about\nthem that fans have always loved. With Blame It On Gravity, the seventh\nOld 97&amp;#039;s record and the second for New West, the band has made its\ndefinitive statement. It&amp;#039;s really exciting, says Rhett Miller, the band&amp;#039;s\nlead singer and songwriter. I read an interview with Randy Newman where\nhe said that if your work is as good at 50 as it was at 20, you&amp;#039;ve won\nthe battle. We&amp;#039;re nowhere near fifty, but I feel like this collection of\nsongs is the best we&amp;#039;ve ever done.\n\nEnjoy !!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27dca421cc2df96f539e0dc12ef049d9a010a89","amp;dn":"The+Old+97%5C%27s-Blame+It+On+Gravity+%282008-Advance-Country%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27dca421cc2df96f539e0dc12ef049d9a010a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,125,202,66,28,194,223,150,245,57,224,220,18,239,4,157,154,1,10,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
