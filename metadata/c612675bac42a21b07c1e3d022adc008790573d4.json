PERSONAL NOTES.\n================================================================================\n\nI've tried to make a copy of this FUCKIN' SONY (!!!!!) DVD since last year, using (among other) AnyDVD HD,CloneDVD 2, DVDShrink, UltraISO, DVDSmith, ISOBuster, DVDFab, MagicISO, DVDDecrypter etc. etc. etc... Poor or no results. The FREE MovieRescuer v1.0.0.0 gave best results. It extracted ALL the .vob files - except the menu, the subtitles (ouch!!) the stills and the production notes. Though, I wasn't satisfied. This morning I've read my emails and there was one suggesting &quot;DVD Ghost&quot;. I thought - &quot;What the hell?! Let's give it a try!&quot;. This gem, this... this... I don't know how to name this MIRACLE software, which is only 2,95MB installed, ripped this (for me)unbeateable SONY DVD in less than 45 minutes. \nBUT...\nBecause there is a &quot;BUT&quot;. Everything is there. All the 3 audio tracks, the extras, all the subtitles, the stills, the production notes - everything is there. BUUUT... By clicking (for example) &quot;Commentary&quot;, you'll have thee &quot;Stills&quot;. By clicking &quot;Hey, You&quot;, you'll have the movie. So, the SONY protection ruined the menu (I've ripped the DVD 3 times - same result). But... you can extract the files using whatever you want (for example, CloneDVD 2 has NO problem now - tested) -I personally recommend mkvmerge GUI, DVD Subtitle Extractor or HandBrake- and then use ConvertXtoDVD to create your own DVD. Or, if this doesn't bother you, keep THIS ONE and just remember what file is opened with what button. \nThis happens only when I try to play the original DVD disc using my computer's DVD-RAM and PowerDVD14, the menu is fucked up. When I play the DVD using my stand-alone LG BluRay player and my TV, everything is fine. So... That's it! Enjoy - I've done my best. Many thanks to those trying to help me, especially to Pompiliu S.......n (Romania) for suggesting DVD Ghost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c612675bac42a21b07c1e3d022adc008790573d4","amp;dn":"PINK+FLOYD+-+%27%27THE+WALL%27%27.+25th+ANNIVERSARY+LIMITED+DIGIPACK+DEL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c612675bac42a21b07c1e3d022adc008790573d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,18,103,91,172,66,162,27,7,193,227,208,34,173,192,8,121,5,115,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
