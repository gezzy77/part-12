This paper is included along with many more classics which\nare not publicly accessible on the Web. Also included are book reviews by \nShannon, editorials he wrote and the text of the 3 US Patents he was granted.\n\nWhen you read in the introduction of textbooks and your professors tell you\nthat you should 'study the original work of great mathematicians', they didn't\nmean that you should go and read one of Euler's 10,000 papers on infinite \nsums which don't use proper notation and are all in Latin or Swiss, they mean\nthat you should grab this torrent and learn from Shannon.\n\nEssential for mathematicians, engineers, hackers and cryptographers.\n\nThe list of all material included is here, and is taken from the complete\nbibliography available at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www2.research.att.com/~njas/doc/shannonbib.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www2.research.att.com/~njas/doc/shannonbib.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   1. ``A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,'' Transactions\n      American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Vol. 57 (1938), pp. 713-723.\n      (Received March 1, 1938.) \n  25. ``Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems,'' Bell System Technical\n      Journal, Vol. 28 (1949), pp. 656-715. ``The material in this paper\n      appeared originally in a confidential report `A Mathematical Theory of\n      Cryptography', dated Sept. 1, 1945, which has now been declassified.''\n  28.
