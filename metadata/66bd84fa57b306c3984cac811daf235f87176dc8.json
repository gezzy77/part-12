Hope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66bd84fa57b306c3984cac811daf235f87176dc8","amp;dn":"Cyber+City+OEDO+808+File+2+-+Psychic+Trooper+%28The+Decoy+Program%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66bd84fa57b306c3984cac811daf235f87176dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,189,132,250,87,179,6,195,152,76,172,129,29,175,35,95,135,23,109,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
