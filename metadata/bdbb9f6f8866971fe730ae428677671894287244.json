MaaloufÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instrument of choice is the quartertone trumpet, which features an extra, fourth valve, enabling him to incorporate microtonal intervals more commonly heard in Middle Eastern music.\n\nThus, the smouldering, offbeat groove of Suspicions carries a heavily spiced hook, played by Maalouf and Turner in tight unison, transforming it into a street dance in the Arab Quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Questions &amp; Answers feels like a Balkan-flavoured take on the tumbling circularity of The Jazz MessengersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wheel Within a Wheel.\n\nExcitement features a stumbling rhythm and MaaloufÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melodramatic exclamations come across like a parody of Charles MingusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ satirical swipe, Fables of Faubus.\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on some of the slower, more spacious pieces that MaaloufÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artistry with the quartertone really cuts through. On Waiting, a minimalist background of drizzling brushes and a stark, two-note bass riff provides the context for delicate, upward-arching vocal inflections, like an Arabesque crooner singing with seductively gentle control.\n\nAnd on Certainly, a loose and lush contemporary ballad setting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ featuring some beautifully paced piano comping from Woeste Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lets Maalouf ease off on the Arabic dialect and play with a soft, sighing accent, like a homesick visitor on the streets of New York.\n\nIt all adds up to a very satisfying cultural exchange.\n\nMusicians:\n\nDouble Bass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Larry Grenadier \nDrum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Clarence Penn \nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frank Woeste \nQuarter Tone Trumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ibrahim Maalouf \nSaxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mark T0urner \n\n\nTrackList:\n\nDoubts (03:31)\nSuspicions (07:10)\nWaiting (04:51)\nQuestions &amp; Answers (04:38)\nWaiting 2 (00:55)\nExcitement (06:45)\nCertainty (06:09)\nSensuality (07:42)\nIssues (06:03)\nSurprises (06:28)\nDoubts 2 (04:55)\nMystery (03:25)\n\nDuration : 62:32 | Bitarte : 320 kBit/s | Year : 2012 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbb9f6f8866971fe730ae428677671894287244","amp;dn":"Ibrahim+Maalouf+-+2012+-+Wind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbb9f6f8866971fe730ae428677671894287244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,187,159,111,136,102,151,31,231,48,174,66,134,119,103,24,148,40,114,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
