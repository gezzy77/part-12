The stereo signal from the live mixing desk was fed to the digital recorder and two stereo ambience mics were simultaneously recorded onto the Beta Hi-Fi section of the recorder.\nThe resulting recording captures the excitement of a live performance as well as the presence and ambience of being part of the audience.\n\n\n&quot;Luka&quot; is a song recorded by Suzanne Vega and released as a single in 1987. It remains her highest-charting hit in the United States, reaching number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Vega also recorded a Spanish-language version of the song, featured on the single.\nThis song was one of the earliest to deal with child abuse and domestic violence. One critic said, &quot;the 'happy' music is a metaphorical denial, making this seem beautiful and serene while discussing something terrible and devastating. It is a wonderful use of tune as a metaphor for how many abuse victims also deny their abuse, and is a profound classic&quot;. wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ab950d2fc231b327d5300b53bd008b3710bd28","amp;dn":"Suzanne+Vega+-+Luka+3%27%27+%5BA%26amp%3BM+CSIG+000050%5D+%7BUS+1988%7D+FLAC+CUE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ab950d2fc231b327d5300b53bd008b3710bd28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,171,149,13,47,194,49,179,39,213,48,11,83,189,0,139,55,16,189,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
