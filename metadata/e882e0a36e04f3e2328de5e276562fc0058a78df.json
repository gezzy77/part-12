They began in San Francisco in 1965, founded by Ron Greco, Cyril Jordan and Roy Loney. They are perhaps best known for their song &quot;Shake Some Action&quot;, which was later featured in the 1995 movie Clueless. The group have been called one of the forerunners of punk rock, and they also had a major influence on the power pop genre.\n\nTheir first album, 1969s Supersnazz, featured Jordan (guitar, vocals), Loney (guitar, vocals), George Alexander (bass, harmonica, vocals), Tim Lynch (guitar, harmonica, vocals) and Danny Mihm (drums). It contained both re-creations of 1950s rock and roll and more melodic songs that anticipated the power pop movement of the 1970s - a genre to which the Flamin' Groovies would eventually contribute significant work. Teenage Head was released in 1971 and is listed in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nSupersnazz is The Flamin' Groovies' first studio album, released in 1969.  \n\nSupersnazz Tracklist:\n1. &quot;Love Have Mercy&quot;\n2. &quot;The Girl Can't Help It&quot;\n3. &quot;Laurie Did It&quot;\n4. &quot;Apart from That&quot;\n5. &quot;Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu&quot;\n6. &quot;The First One's Free&quot;\n7. &quot;Pagan Rachel&quot;\n8. &quot;Somethin' Else / Pistol Packin' Mama&quot;\n9. &quot;Brushfire&quot;\n10. &quot;Bam Balam&quot;\n11. &quot;Around the Corner\n\nTeenage Head is The Flamin' Groovies' third studio album, released in 1971. Released the same year as The Rolling Stones' classic album Sticky Fingers, Mick Jagger reportedly noticed the similarities between the albums and thought the Flamin' Groovies did the better take on the theme of classic blues and rock 'n roll revisited in a modern context.\n\nTeenage Head Tracklist:\n\nAll songs written by Cyril Jordan and Roy A.
