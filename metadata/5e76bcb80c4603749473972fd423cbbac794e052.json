This is thus the first book to find theoretical explanations to the sometimes-puzzling tokamak observations.\nFollowing a look at the quest for fusion power, the author goes on to examine tokamak magnetic fields and energy losses, as well as plasma flow and loop voltage. There is also a discussion of the technical constraints on the recently announced ITER design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e76bcb80c4603749473972fd423cbbac794e052","amp;dn":"Theory+of+Tokamak+Transport+-+New+Aspects+for+Nuclear+Fusion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e76bcb80c4603749473972fd423cbbac794e052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,118,188,184,12,70,3,116,148,115,151,47,212,35,203,186,199,148,224,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
