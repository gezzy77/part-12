In Australia's Northern Territory, a man tells us one of the stories of his people and his land. It's a story of an older man, Minygululu, who has three wives and realizes that his younger brother Dayindi may try to steal away the youngest wife. So, over a few days and several trips to hunt and gather, Minygululu tells Dayindi a story set in the time of their ancestors when a stranger came to the village and disrupted the lives of a serious man named Ridjimiraril, his three wives, and his younger brother Yeeralparil who had no wife and liked to visit his youngest sister-in-law. Through stories, can values be taught and balance achieved?\n\nWritten and Directed by Rolf de Heer \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466399/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466399/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:761030326fab1b5435f722f60f2c064544c8c7fe","amp;dn":"Ten+Canoes+%282006%29DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"761030326fab1b5435f722f60f2c064544c8c7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,16,48,50,111,171,27,84,53,247,34,246,15,44,6,69,68,200,199,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
