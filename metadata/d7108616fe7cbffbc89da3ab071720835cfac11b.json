Throughout the day, the app dynamically changes your homescreen to present the right apps, contacts and websites based on how you use your phone. The more you use it the better it gets. Our scribble feature ensures youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always only one-second away from everything.\n\n\n\nTHE RIGHT APPS\nAT THE RIGHT TIME\n\nThroughout the day, Z Launcher is learning how you use your phone and promoting your favorite apps so you can get to them faster.\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re texting a certain someone, trying not to search for apps in the car, or multi-tasking at the office, your screen changes based on your everyday life. The more you use it, the better it gets.\n\n\n\nA FAST WAY TO\nFIND EVERYTHING ELSE\n\nThe fastest way to find any app on your phone in one second is by scribbling in the first letter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ right on the home screen. It's easy.\n\n\n\nNokiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technologies group, which is a separate entity from its phone division, has developed Z Launcher, which has a unique feature that lets you write letters on the screen instead of typing them out on a keyboard. Z LauncherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bread and butter is to give you a constantly changing phone experience, that arranges and brings up search results based on what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently doing on your phone. It also gives you a feature that lets you quickly write out whatever youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re searching for right in the middle of your homescreen to search for apps or files on your phone, or through Google search.\n\nThe launcher is very different from the current Android interface that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all grown accustomed to, and instead features a very minimalistic design that is devoid of widgets and GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ubiquitous search bar up top that has become the norm.\n\nSo how does Z Launcher decided what apps to display? Well the phone takes into consideration a few factors: your location, the time of day it is, and who you were last talking to (Z launcher bases this off of your call logs). It also is supposed to evolve over time and better learn how you use your device. If it works perfectly, then it should populate your home screen with the apps, web pages, or call contacts that you would contact most at that moment. If it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, then you scribble on the screen what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for, and it will bring up a number of suggestions.\n\nHead designer, Brook Eaton, assures that the handwriting suggestions shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take more than a one letter swipe for you to find what it is youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for. Users have reported that the phone does well when you type in one or two letters, but it started making more errors when they pushed it to three or four letter scribbles.\n\nNow your usage history and phone behaviors should be safe and sound with Z Launcher; your data wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be shared with advertisers or marketers. Currently, the beta of Z Launcher will work on the Galaxy S4 and S5, including Nexus devices, like the 4 and 5. If you want to try it out, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to get it from the Google Play Store, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to head on over to NokiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Z Launcher site to download it.\n\nNokia is even looking to customize iOS with Z Launcher, but currently, Apple doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allow third-party applications to modify the homescreen and Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of iOS, so that might be a ways off. For the future, Z Launcher also wants to add WiFi as a variable for its customization as well; like hooking up to Bluetooth sound system automatically when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re home, for example, or putting your phone on silent when you connect to your workÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WiFi.\n\nZ Launcher isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first custom Android launcher, however, the Nokia team is confident that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to developer the application even further.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7108616fe7cbffbc89da3ab071720835cfac11b","amp;dn":"Z+Launcher+apk+%28New+Android+Launcher+from+Nokia%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7108616fe7cbffbc89da3ab071720835cfac11b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,16,134,22,254,124,191,251,200,157,163,171,7,23,32,131,92,250,193,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
