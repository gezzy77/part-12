They are remembered above all for their hit &quot;In the\nSummertime&quot;. It remains the most successful and most instantly recognisable summer song.\nTheir name was inspired by the poem Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, from T. S. Eliot's Old\nPossum's Book of Practical Cats.According to Joseph Murrell's The Book of Golden Discs\n(1978), 'Mungomania' was possibly the most startling and unpredicted pop phenomenon to hit\nBritain since The Beatles.\n\nDorset and Earl had previously been members of The Good Earth. Soon after recruiting King\nand Cole, they made their national debut at the Hollywood Festival at Newcastle-under-Lyme,\nStaffordshire in May 1970, the week their first single, &quot;In the Summertime&quot; was released.\nThey stole the show and the record topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks, made\nnumber one in 26 countries around the world, and to date has sold around 30 million copies.\nMungo Jerry made their first trip to the United States in September 1970. After John Godfrey\nreplaced Cole, their second single &quot;Baby Jump&quot; also topped the UK chart in March 1971. A\nthird hit, &quot;Lady Rose&quot; (also in 1971), gave the group the image as a band for producing\nsummertime based hits.\n\n\n\n   1. (03:35) - In The Summertime\n   2. (04:13) - Baby Jump\n   3.
