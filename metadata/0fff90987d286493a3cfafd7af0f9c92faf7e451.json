Headlines PUSH Content (Weblink)\n\nWith Girls Aloud seemingly a whole lotta history and the Sugababes effectively pushing the (self destruct) button, The Saturdays have emerged as the girl group on the up!. Despite lacking the Number 1 count of their rivals, the girls make up for it by producing their own brand of memorable pop. Headlines is the third studio album and of the eight tracks on the album, only six are new (Ego and Forever is Over, previously found on Wordshaker, find their way onto this album). Missing You has Number 1 written all the way through it, whilst the remaining five tracks all put forward good cases as future singles. Fans won't be disappointed.\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n[img]http://i487.photobucket.com/albums/rr240/allan1959_2008/3acc2b6eseedball.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fff90987d286493a3cfafd7af0f9c92faf7e451","amp;dn":"The+Saturdays+Headlines+2010%28split+tracks+%2Bcover%29barney%5C%27s+rg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fff90987d286493a3cfafd7af0f9c92faf7e451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,255,144,152,125,40,100,147,163,207,175,215,175,15,156,146,250,247,228,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
