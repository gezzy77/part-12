Government policy includes taking half-caste children from their Aboriginal mothers and sending them a thousand miles away to what amounts to indentured servitude, &quot;to save them from themselves.&quot; Molly, Daisy, and Grace (two sisters and a cousin who are 14, 10, and 8) arrive at their Gulag and promptly escape, under Molly's lead. For days they walk north, following a fence that keeps rabbits from settlements, eluding a native tracker and the regional constabulary. Their pursuers take orders from the government's &quot;chief protector of Aborigines,&quot; A.O. Neville, blinded by Anglo-Christian certainty, evolutionary world view and conventional wisdom. Can the girls survive?\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nAs always please seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31b5ff96b2f77984d8ad5abbb3cb5a2ce3c3a3a","amp;dn":"Rabbit-Proof+Fence+%282002%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31b5ff96b2f77984d8ad5abbb3cb5a2ce3c3a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,27,95,249,107,47,119,152,77,138,213,171,187,60,181,162,206,60,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
