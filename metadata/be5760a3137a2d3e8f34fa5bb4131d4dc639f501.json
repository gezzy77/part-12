Born Ernest Evans on October 3, 1941, in Spring Gulley, South Carolina, he worked in a local poultry shop while in high school, and while on the job often entertained customers by singing and cracking jokes. His workplace antics helped win an audition with the local Cameo-Parkway label, who signed the fledgling singer in 1959; at the suggestion of no less than Dick Clark's wife, the portly youth was re-christened Chubby Checker, the name a sly reference to Fats Domino. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t93.29% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tABKCO\nCatalogue:\t\t18771-92252\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Dancin' Party\n02.The Twist\n03.Toot\n04.The Class\n05.Twistin' U.S.A.\n06.The Hucklebuck\n07.Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\n08.Pony Time\n09.Dance The Mess Around\n10.Good, Good Lovin'\n11.Let's Twist Again\n12.The Fly\n13.Slow Twistin'\n14.Popeye The Hitchhiker\n15.Limbo Rock\n16.Let's Limbo Some More\n17.Hooka Tooka\n18.Loddy Lo\n19.Hey, Bobba Needle\n20.Birdland\n21.Surf Party\n22.Twist It Up\n23.Twistin' Round The World\n24.Jingle Bell Rock (Feat.
