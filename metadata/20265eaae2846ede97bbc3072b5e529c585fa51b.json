Hamilton takes readers inside FDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s White House Oval Study - his personal command center - and into the meetings where he battled with Churchill about strategy and tactics and overrode the near mutinies of his own generals and secretary of war. \n\nTime and again, FDR was proven right and his allies and generals were wrong. When the generals wanted to attack the Nazi-fortified coast of France, FDR knew the Allied forces werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ready. When Churchill insisted his Far East colonies were loyal and would resist the Japanese, Roosevelt knew it was a fantasy. As HamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account reaches its climax with the Torch landings in North Africa in late 1942, the tide of war turns in the AlliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ favor and FDRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius for psychology and military affairs is clear. This intimate, sweeping look at a great president in historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest conflict is must reading.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20265eaae2846ede97bbc3072b5e529c585fa51b","amp;dn":"The+Mantle+of+Command+%28Nigel+Hamilton%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20265eaae2846ede97bbc3072b5e529c585fa51b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,38,94,170,226,132,110,222,151,187,195,7,43,94,82,156,88,95,165,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
