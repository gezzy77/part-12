It is jammed with spirit-raising jollity tinged with a raw ache for peace. Typical is Vera Lynns Its A Lovely Day Tomorrow, all fleapit Wurlitzer and tea dance shuffle, yet still hopeful. Theres boisterousness, represented by Flanagan &amp; Allen, Glenn Miller and the Andrews Sisters, but the songs that sound best outside their historical context are slowies such as the Ink Spots Whispering Grass and Marlene Dietrichs Lili Marlene.A great nostalgic trip down memory lane. \n\n1- The White Cliffs Of Dover - Vera Lynn\n2- We're Going To Hang Out The Washing On The Siegfried Line - Flanagan &amp; Allen\n3- Fight On The Beaches - Winston Churchill\n4- Moonlight Serenade - Glenn Miller\n5- Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree - The Andrews Sisters\n6- Thanks For The Memory - Bob Hope\n7- The Lambeth Walk - Eddie Cantor\n8- Round The Back Of The Arches - Flanagan &amp; Allen\n9- Their Finest Hour - Winston Churchill\n10- We'll Meet Again - Vera Lynn\n11- American Patrol - Glenn Miller\n12- I'll Be Seeing You - Bing Crosby\n13- Over The Rainbow- Judy Garland\n14- Run Rabbit Run - Flanagan &amp; Allen\n15- Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy - The Andrews Sisters\n16- There'll Always Be An England - Alfred Piccaver\n17- I Don't Want To Walk Without You - Bing Crosby\n18- It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow - Vera Lynn\n19- Lili Marlene - Marlene Dietrich\n20- It Had To Be You - Dick Haymes\n21- Whispering Grass - The Ink Spots\n22- I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time - The Andrews Sisters\n23- Yours - Vera Lynn\n24- Moonlight Becomes You - Bing Crosby\n25- We'll Smile Again - Flanagan &amp; Allen\n26- Now Is The Hour - Gracie Fields\n27- A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square - Vera Lynn\n28- Never In The Field Of Human Conflict - Winston Churchill\n\n    260 kbs    79 mins\n\n                        Thank you for seeding :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ac1d7f4a9648b63c6afab0703a4169caf08aba","amp;dn":"Songs+That+Won+The+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ac1d7f4a9648b63c6afab0703a4169caf08aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,172,29,127,74,150,72,182,60,106,250,176,112,58,65,105,202,240,138,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
