WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take a look at a variety of modeling tools you can use in your daily work. We'll split edges with Loop Slice and Add Loop. We'll learn to Bevel and Extrude. And we'll learn to use Action Centers and Falloffs to change how our tools affect the geometry. We'll also talk about subdivision surfaces and how they can be used to create very smooth models with edges that have been hardened through edge weighting or actual geometry. \n\nWe won't be covering all of MODO's many modeling tools, but rather focus on the tools that you're going to find most useful as you begin the modeling process. Once you have a better understanding of how these tools work together, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to create your own modeling solutions and really come up with a workflow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable to you. With that, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get started by taking a look at polygons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc0514aebf1b1db690d6343eb79133ddcb51e0e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Modeling+in+MODO+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc0514aebf1b1db690d6343eb79133ddcb51e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,192,81,74,235,241,177,219,105,13,99,67,235,121,19,61,220,181,30,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
