Theories behind the mysterious death of Marilyn Monroe change yearly, and some believe Jack the Ripper was a member of the royal family. History books say Hitler burned down the ReichstagÃ¢â‚¬â€but did he? And who really organized the conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln?\n\nAcclaimed investigative journalist Edward Jay Epstein cut his teeth on one of the most notorious murder mysteries of the 20th century in his first book, Inquest: The Warren Commission and the Establishment of Truth, one of the first books on the assassination and an instant bestseller. His conclusion? The Commission left open too many questions.\n\nHe examines those questions here, as well as some of the most famous Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsolvedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or mysterious crimes of all time, coming to some startling conclusions. His method in each investigation is simple: outline what is known and unknown, and show the plausible theories of a case. Where more than one theory exists, he shows the evidence for and against each. And when something remains to be proved, he says as much.\n\nIn The Annals of Unsolved Crime, Epstein re-visits his most famous investigations and adds dozens of new cases. From the Lindbergh kidnapping to the JonBenet Ramsey murder case, from the Black Dahlia murder to anthrax attacks on America, from the vanishing of Jimmy Hoffa to the case of Amanda KnoxÃ¢â‚¬â€Epstein considers three dozen high-profile crimes and their tangled histories and again proves himself one of our most penetrating journalists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ed0e9b19755c32076a99006c211abd8684aecd","amp;dn":"The+Annals+of+Unsolved+Crime+-+Edward+Jay+Epstein.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ed0e9b19755c32076a99006c211abd8684aecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,237,14,155,25,117,92,50,7,106,153,0,108,33,26,189,134,132,174,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
