I picked them up on individual torrents, but I&amp;#039;m putting them up all together in the hope of increasing their activity.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sonicyouth.com/jukebox/jukebox.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sonicyouth.com/jukebox/jukebox.html&lt;/a&gt; has the current one.\n\nVisit http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/sy/ for information on each song. Many were once hard to find rarities and live versions of studio songs that have since been released on either the deluxe editions of certain cds or on the Destroyed Room. Still, nice to have them in their original mix tape setting, and some of these songs haven&amp;#039;t been released elsewhere.\n\nI haven&amp;#039;t been able to complete the download of Mix Tape 5, but I included it here just in case someone with a seed will see this torrent and complete it for us.\n\nThanks to the original seeders.\n\nVolume 1\n01-Pattern Recognition\n02-Lightnin&amp;#039; (part2)\n03-Silver Rocket-You Pose You Lose\n04-3 Sectional Love Seat\n05-Untitled\n06-Stalker\n07-Think It Over\n08-Expressway To Yr Skull\n09-Mote\n10-I Love You Golden Blue\n\nVolume 2\n01 - bee bee&amp;#039;s song\n02 - secret girl remix (velvet plug)\n03 - derniere minute electrifee\n04 - doctor&amp;#039;s orders\n05 - loop cat\n06 - queen anne chair\n07 - stereo sanctity\n08 - safe in hell\n09 - she is not alone\n10 - fire engine (part 1)\n11 - fire engine (part 2)\n12 - santa don&amp;#039;t cop out on dope\n\nVolume 3\n01 - free city rhymes (alt. take)\n02 - crosby (early take)\n03 - catholic block\n04 - the drummer is fine (part 1)\n05 - the drummer is fine (part 2)\n06 - the drummer is fine (part 3)\n07 - experimental #8\n08 - lee #2 (alt. mix)\n09 - She&amp;#039;s in a bad mood\n10 - pterodactyl wars\n\nVolume 4\n01 - campfire\n02 - &amp;#039;cross the breeze\n03 - giggles\n04 - platoon II\n05 - waist\n06 - blink\n07 - pipeline/kill time\n08 - thought bubbles\n09 - tomorrow never knows/glass onion\n10 - razor blade\n11 - encore\n\nVolume 5\n01 - reena\n02 - cherry&amp;#039;s blues\n03 - destroyer (live)\n04 - g-force\n05 - incinerate\n06 - raepS gninruB\n07 - maerD I demaerD I\n08 - enolA toN sI ehS\n09 - tI hsuP oT tnaW t&amp;#039;noD I\n10 - daB ehT dnA dooG ehT\n11 - do you belive in rapture?\n\nVolume 6\n01 - Kissability\n02 - Ca Plane Pour Moi\n03 - The Sprawl - Part 1\n04 - The Sprawl - Part 2\n05 - fri/end\n06 - Teen Age Riot\n07 - Move Away\n08 - Untitled (Lee Home Demos)\n09 - Superstar\n10 - Hey Joni\n11 - Compilation Blues\n12 - Expressway Outro - Part 1\n13 - Expressway Outro - Part 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234890e4c1dfa97b87f39a782d5ad64e53541ae5","amp;dn":"Sonic+Youth+Mix+Tapes+1-6+Rarities+and+b-sides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234890e4c1dfa97b87f39a782d5ad64e53541ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,72,144,228,193,223,169,123,135,243,154,120,45,90,214,78,83,84,26,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
