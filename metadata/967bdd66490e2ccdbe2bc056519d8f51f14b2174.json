Exactingly faithful to the spirit and letter of the Flemish masters, he produces uncannily accurate &quot;originals&quot; - pictures the painters themselves might have envied. In an age of counterfeit emotion and taste, the real and the fake have become indistinguishable; yet Gwyon's forgeries reflect a truth that others cannot touch - cannot even recognize. First published in 1955, this lively, witty, and labyrinthine novel stands among the very best of our time.\n\n\n\n64kbps, .mp3, narrated by Nick Sullivan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:967bdd66490e2ccdbe2bc056519d8f51f14b2174","amp;dn":"The+Recognitions+by+William+Gaddis+-+unabridged+audio+book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"967bdd66490e2ccdbe2bc056519d8f51f14b2174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,123,221,102,73,14,44,205,190,43,192,86,81,157,143,81,241,75,33,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
