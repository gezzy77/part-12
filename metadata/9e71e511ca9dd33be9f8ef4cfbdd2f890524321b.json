Basically, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the techniques magicians and gamblers use to secretly remove cards from the pack into hidden positions in the hands. Gamblers refer to it as holding out. In fact, a card can be palmed from any location in the deck into pretty much any palm position without your spectators ever suspecting. As a result, these cards can be surreptitiously placed either back on top, bottom, or anywhere you conceive (your pocket, a shoe, your spectatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purse, even another palm). Palming also affords the ability to retain certain cards while the spectators shuffle, only to be replaced later, under your control.\n\nWith each purchase of If an Octopus Could Palm, a deck of commemorative playing cards is included. These cards were printed in limited quantities and will not be sold separately. The artwork for the cards was inspired by Juan Luis BuÃƒÂ±uelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original painting for the cover of the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e71e511ca9dd33be9f8ef4cfbdd2f890524321b","amp;dn":"%5BMagic%5D+DAN+AND+DAVE+_+IF+AN+OCTOPUS+COULD+PALM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e71e511ca9dd33be9f8ef4cfbdd2f890524321b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,113,229,17,202,157,211,59,233,248,239,76,251,221,47,137,5,36,50,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
