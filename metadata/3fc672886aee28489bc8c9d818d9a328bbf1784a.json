Thus a family of four now owes in debt $213,332 and by the end of this year, that figure will grow to $230,664.\n\nSo the total, true cost of running the government and the share to a family of four is $279,203.36. I think weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting screwed.\n\nWith the debt slated to continue growing at a rate of $1.3 trillion per year with no end in sight, how soon before we go the way of the USSR?\n\nThis special Edition of Survive and Thrive contains both the first and second books in the best-selling series along with a special Foreword and the first chapter of the next in the series, Survive and Thrive After the Energy Dies, due out later this month.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc672886aee28489bc8c9d818d9a328bbf1784a","amp;dn":"Survive+and+Thrive+%28Survive+and+Thrive+Special+2nd+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc672886aee28489bc8c9d818d9a328bbf1784a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,198,114,136,106,238,40,72,155,200,201,216,24,217,163,40,187,241,120,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
