So, why hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a collection of their complete, original Dunhill/ABC hit singles ever been released? Well, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the little matter of the original mono master tapes. There are various stories about what happened, including one with Dunhill head Jay Lasker pitching all the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi-track recordings and mono masters after having deemed them obsolete. And so the classic hit singles by the Grass Roots have for the most part only surfaced in their stereo album versions on the various anthologies of the band. But when the going gets tough for a reissue label, Real Gone Music gets going. After a worldwide search for the best sources available, the label has rounded upÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nall two dozen Dunhill/ABC hit singles (including the censored and uncensored versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Live for TodayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and their biggest smash, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight ConfessionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and put them together into one AMAZING-sounding package! Indeed, this collection offers the truest essence of the band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ those hook-filled singles in that glorious, original mono sound mixed and mastered to punch through Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s AM radio. And, by covering the years 1965 to 1973, The Grass Roots: The Complete Original Dunhill/ABC Hit Singles also provides a fantastic overview of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tangled history and many line-ups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all meticulously explained by Ed OsborneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liner notes featuring quotes from group mastermind Steve Barri Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with late lead singer Rob Grill the closest to a career-long member (their first two singles featured Bill Fulton on vocals).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c823934373ad8c741446333d7bc59045a0adc7dd","amp;dn":"The+Grass+Roots+-+Complete+Original+Dunhill+ABC+Hit+Singles+%28201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c823934373ad8c741446333d7bc59045a0adc7dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,35,147,67,115,173,140,116,20,70,51,61,123,197,144,69,160,173,199,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
