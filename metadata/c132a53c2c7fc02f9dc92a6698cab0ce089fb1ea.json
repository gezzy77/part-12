The band was originally formed as a duo consisting of singer and guitarist Gregory Dunn and drummer Nicholas Pizzolato. Dunn, who was in high school at the time, was looking for a way to write songs that captured moments of his life in music, and with the help of Pizzolato, the two created the intricate, sweeping sound that would define Moving Mountains as a musical entity. \n\nTracks:\n\n1.
