When the pioneer logo comes up, [b]press and hold the menu, map, eject and the reset buttons[/b] at the same time. When you hear a pop sound from your speakers, let go of the eject button but [b]continue to hold menu, map, and eject buttons[/b]. This will bring you to a blue screen, telling you to reset the unit (ignore this), you will have to enter the service combination. Press the volume knob in this sequence and you will see * signs for each push: [b]Up, Up, Down, Menu, Left, Right.[/b]\n3. [b]Select Wince Upgrade[/b]\n4. Select [b]Update SD Format[/b]\n5.
