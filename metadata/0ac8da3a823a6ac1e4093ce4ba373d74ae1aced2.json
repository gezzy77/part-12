The first title of the series was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Since then, seven titles and three spin-offs have been released. The titles are historical real-time strategy games, and their gameplay revolves around two main game modes: random map and campaign. This game was to compete with another hit game back then called \\&quot;Civilization\\&quot;. The games are set amidst historical events. Age of Empires focused on events in Europe and Asia, spanning from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the rise. The newest installment, Age of Empires Online takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on fictional elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology.\n\nGame port status:\nGreen (Fully playable)\n\nPersonal notes:\nI\\'m not sure if its a glitch or not but the background image and the text in the main screen kinda blend.\nMultiplayer/LAN untested (Assuming not working)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac8da3a823a6ac1e4093ce4ba373d74ae1aced2","amp;dn":"Age+of+Empires+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac8da3a823a6ac1e4093ce4ba373d74ae1aced2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,200,218,58,130,58,106,193,228,9,60,228,186,55,61,116,174,26,206,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
