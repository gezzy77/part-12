This 1991 filming of \n\nthe band&amp;#039;s live presentation of the album is no substitute for its electrifying \n\nstage show, but as filmed concerts go, it&amp;#039;s a pretty good replacement. Visually, \n\ndirector Wayne Isham and his editor Jeff Richter do their best to keep up with the \n\nmultimedia production: films, lighting, cued sounds, and dialogue are as important \n\nto Operation: Livecrime as the music. But enough of the convoluted story comes \n\nthrough to allow even the uninitiated to follow it. Musically, the band is in top \n\nform, especially singer Geoff Tate, who seems to hit notes most rock singers \n\ndidn&amp;#039;t even know existed.\n\n\nResolution: 640x480 4:3\n\nRuntime: 1:04\n\nCodec: DivX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1effb524049f510b906196ad546aed06e73754b0","amp;dn":"Queensryche.Operation.LiveCrime.DivX.DvdRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1effb524049f510b906196ad546aed06e73754b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,255,181,36,4,159,81,11,144,97,150,173,84,106,237,6,231,55,84,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
