It was back in the late 19th century in Rio de Janeiro when Brazilian musicians started to blend European melodies, Afro-Brazilian rhythms and the melancholic interpretation of the Brazilian Indians' music to create Choro. Choro is credited as being the first musical expression of Brazil's melting pot and had a prominent place in the development of Brazil's cultural identity. Choro remained a major popular music style until the 1920s, leading directly into Samba and later to Bossa Nova. After a slight decline in popularity, Choro music has made a remarkable comeback over the past few decades.\n\nThe film remembers the history but shows, above all, a colorful picture of Choro's vitality today. The guiding line of the film is the combo &quot;Trio Madeira Brasil&quot; composed of three of Brazil's outstanding Choro musicians. During a &quot;Roda de Choro&quot;, a traditional Brazilian kind of private jam session, the Trio brings up a concert project. During these sessions or at their homes, some of the most interesting Choro musicians play and remember key events in the history of this Brazilian urban music. A look into a Choro workshop with over 450 participants of all ages illustrates the off-hand genuine Brazilian way to play. &quot;Playing&quot; interviews with well-known Samba and Bossa Nova artists like ZezÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Gonzaga, Elza Soares and Guinga illustrate the reciprocal inspiration with Samba and Bossa Nova music. A final show of the &quot;Trio Madeira Brasil&quot; with their guests in one of Rio's traditional music halls show once more the opulence of rhythms and melodies in Choro that has evolved over the past 130 years into a fascinating form of modern tropical sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee7e3d4428e688e0330b0cc79c5f789e57a9fd4","amp;dn":"Brasileirinho+-+Grandes+Encontros+do+Choro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee7e3d4428e688e0330b0cc79c5f789e57a9fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,231,227,212,66,142,104,142,3,48,176,204,121,197,247,137,229,122,159,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
