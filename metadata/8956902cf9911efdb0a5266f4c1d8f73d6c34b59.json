In this tour, filmed in 2004, Connolly visited New Zealand and travelled 8,500 km throughout the country, from Stewart Island in the south, through South Island and North Island, to Ninety Mile Beach in the north. As he did on his 1996 tour of Australia, Connolly travelled on a custom-made Yamaha XV1700 Warrior trike that had been built by the &quot;Trike Shop&quot; in the United Kingdom. The trike is now in the hands of a new owner in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe series was made up of eight episodes in which Connolly gave insights into the history and culture of the country, especially its Maori heritage, while also giving highlights from the New Zealand leg of his Too Old to Die Young tour. The leather jacket he often wore sports a skull with glasses, the logo of the tour.\nContinuing his catalogue of nude endeavours, he bungee jumped from the Nevis High Wire in Queenstown.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe Scottish comedian travels to Queenstown, where he takes a nostalgic trip on a 92-year-old ferry before baring all in a bungee jump from the Nevis tower. The map leads him on to Greymouth, and an encounter with a Bush-music band evoking the 'white' sound of New Zealand, followed by a meeting with a Maori who demonstrates various uses for jade. Billy ends his visit on a high note as he soaks up the breathtaking views during a helicopter ride over the famous Fiordland\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6463/worldtourofnewzealandsce.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6463/worldtourofnewzealandsce.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2438/worldtourofnewzealandscq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2438/worldtourofnewzealandscq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9994/worldtourofnewzealandscf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9994/worldtourofnewzealandscf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9029/worldtourofnewzealandscv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9029/worldtourofnewzealandscv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6881/worldtourofnewzealandsc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6881/worldtourofnewzealandsc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6672/worldtourofnewzealandsck.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6672/worldtourofnewzealandsck.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8629/worldtourofnewzealandscu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8629/worldtourofnewzealandscu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2831/worldtourofnewzealandsco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2831/worldtourofnewzealandsco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1796 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 40.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 560 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.billyconnolly.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.billyconnolly.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8956902cf9911efdb0a5266f4c1d8f73d6c34b59","amp;dn":"BBC+Billy+Connollys+World+Tour+of+New+Zealand+2of8+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8956902cf9911efdb0a5266f4c1d8f73d6c34b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,86,144,44,249,145,30,253,176,165,38,111,76,29,143,115,214,195,75,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
