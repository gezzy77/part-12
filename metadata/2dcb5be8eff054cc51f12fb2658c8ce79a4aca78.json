Then, attempting to break a Nazi code during World War II, he successfully designed and built one, thus ensuring the Allied victory. Turing became a champion of artificial intelligence, but his work was cut short. As an openly gay man at a time when homosexuality was illegal in England, he was convicted and forced to undergo a humiliating ''treatment'' that may have led to his suicide.\n\nWith a novelist's sensitivity, David Leavitt portrays Turing in all his humanity - his eccentricities, his brilliance, his fatal candor - and elegantly explains his work and its implications.\n\nSeries: Great Discoveries\nMP3 CD: 1 pages\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio; Unabridged MP3CD edition (June 1, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1483018393\nISBN-13: 978-1483018393\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
