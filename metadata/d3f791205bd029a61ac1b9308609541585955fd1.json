While often criticized as commercial, the band was noted for its creative arrangements and interpretations, and their cover choices gave exposure (and royalties) to several talented songwriters: Nilsson (&quot;One&quot;), Laura Nyro (&quot;Eli's Coming&quot;), Randy Newman (&quot;Mama Told Me (Not to Come)&quot;), Hoyt Axton (&quot;Joy to the World&quot;), Argent's Russ Ballard (&quot;Liar&quot;), and Leo Sayer (&quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;). Wells and Hutton met in the '60s while the former was the lead singer of the Enemies and the latter, a writer/producer for Hanna Barbera Records who had recorded several singles, served as producer. In 1967, Hutton conceived the idea of a three-vocalist group, and he and Wells enlisted mutual friend Negron. They took their name from an Australian expression describing low nocturnal temperatures in the outback (the colder the night, the more dogs needed to keep warm while sleeping). The three cut a few unsuccessful singles and decided to expand their range by hiring backing musicians, who included guitarist Mike Allsup, keyboardist Jimmy Greenspoon, bassist Joe Schermie, and drummer Floyd Sneed. &quot;One&quot; became the band's first Top Ten hit in 1969, while &quot;Mama Told Me (Not to Come)&quot; hit number one a year later. &quot;Joy to the World&quot; became the group's biggest hit in 1971, spending six weeks on top of the pop charts, and their streak continued with their final number one, 1972's &quot;Black and White&quot; (a U.K. reggae hit for Greyhound), and their final Top Ten, 1974's &quot;The Show Must Go On.&quot;\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Joy To The World\n02.One\n03.Sure As I'm Sittin' Here\n04.An Old Fashioned Love Song\n05.Let Me Serenade You\n06.Shambala\n07.Black And White\n08.Never Been To Spain\n09.One Man Band\n10.Play Something Sweet (Brickyard Blues)\n11.I'd Be So Happy\n12.Liar\n13.Family Of Man\n14.The Show Must Go On\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f791205bd029a61ac1b9308609541585955fd1","amp;dn":"Three+Dog+Night+-+Joy+To+The+World+%281975%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f791205bd029a61ac1b9308609541585955fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,247,145,32,91,208,41,166,26,193,185,48,134,9,84,21,133,149,95,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
