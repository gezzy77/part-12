The war lasts for decades, long enough for the remaining survivors to have forgotten the reasons for it in the first place. Strategic bombing is so successful that civilisation on both sides is totally devastated. Humanity falls into a new Dark Age where the technology level is reduced to that of medieval times, symbolised by an automobile being drawn like a cart by a horse. There is even a medieval-type plague sweeping through the land, known as &quot;the wandering sickness.&quot;\n\nVideo: FMP4 416x320 25.00fps 1185Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 64Kbps\nRunning time: 1:32:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93158bb5486cceb516c8c35098fa9df14a21f457","amp;dn":"H+G+Wells+-+Things+to+Come+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93158bb5486cceb516c8c35098fa9df14a21f457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,21,139,181,72,108,206,181,22,200,195,80,152,250,157,241,74,33,244,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
