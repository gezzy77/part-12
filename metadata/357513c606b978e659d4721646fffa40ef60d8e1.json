This is a book she published last year. A revised edition was just published in April, but this is the 2012 edition.\n\n\n\ndescription:\n\nGroundbreaking exposÃƒÂ© of the rapid shift to robot warfare, by a leading antiwar activist.\n\nDrone Warfare is the first comprehensive analysis of one of the fastest growingÃ¢â‚¬â€and most secretiveÃ¢â‚¬â€fronts in global conflict: the rise of robot warfare. In 2000, the Pentagon had fewer than fifty aerial drones; ten years later, it had a fleet of nearly 7,500, and the US Air Force now trains more drone Ã¢â‚¬Å“pilotsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ than bomber and fighter pilots combined. Drones are already a $5 billion business in the US alone. The human cost? Drone strikes have killed more than 200 children alone in Pakistan and Yemen.\n\nCODEPINK and Global Exchange cofounder Medea Benjamin provides the first extensive analysis of who is producing the drones, where they are being used, who controls these unmanned planes, and what are the legal and moral implications of their use. In vivid, readable style, this book also looks at what activists, lawyers, and scientists across the globe are doing to ground these weapons. Benjamin argues that the assassinations we are carrying out from the air will come back to haunt us when others start doing the same thingÃ¢â‚¬â€to us.\n\nReview\n\n''In this remarkably cogent and carefully researched book, Medea Benjamin makes it clear that drones are not just another high-tech military trinket. Drone Warfare sketches out the nightmare possibilities posed by this insane proliferation.'' --Barbara Ehrenreich, New York Times bestselling author\n\n''Activist extraordinaire Medea Benjamin has documented how the US government's use of drones to murder hundreds of innocent civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen has increased the danger to our national security. Benjamin's Drone Warfare is the first book that reveals the vocal international citizen opposition that challenges the legality and morality of America's extrajudicial execution drones before they kill here at home.'' --Ann Wright, US Army colonel (Ret.)\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMEDEA BENJAMIN is a cofounder of the peace group CODEPINK and the international human rights organization Global Exchange.
