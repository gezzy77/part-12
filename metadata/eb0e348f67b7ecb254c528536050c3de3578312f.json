The authors place special emphasis on the worked examples in each section, treating them as the primary means of instruction, since students rely so heavily on examples to complete assignments. Many of the applications (both within the examples and exercises) are also uniquely designed so that students have an experience that is more true to life--students must read information as it appears in headline news sources and extract only the relevant information needed to solve a stated problem. This promotes the text's focus on developing better study habits, problem solving and critical thinking skills along with orienting students to think and reason mathematically. Through Elementary Algebra, students will not only be better prepared for future math courses, they will be better prepared to solve problems and answer questions they encounter in their own lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0e348f67b7ecb254c528536050c3de3578312f","amp;dn":"Elementary+Algebra+%5B2013%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0e348f67b7ecb254c528536050c3de3578312f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,14,52,143,103,183,236,178,84,197,40,83,96,80,195,222,53,120,49,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
