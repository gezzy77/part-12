And there is no greater struggle than trying to understand the pain and suffering that we and others we love often endure.People of faith struggle to reconcile the concept of a loving God and suffering. Despite the hope we are given, there is still despair and the question of why Ã¢â‚¬â€œ why did God let this happen? What does all this really mean in terms of my faith or my understanding of God? Why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I find peace in my heart?\n\nDaniel E. Johnson opens a door on the suffering in his own life and how he has drawn meaning and hope from these painful journeys, providing a path for others lost in the darkness and hopelessness of doubt to discover comfort and peace in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfailing love.\n\nAbout the author:\nDaniel Johnson, writer and speaker, is the author of several books, including Come Home, America and Aim for the Children. He resides with his wife in the Pacific Northwest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6764537c9583ed75078cca5bf7c8316d6b4830f8","amp;dn":"When+You+Ask+Why+-+Daniel+E.+Johnson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6764537c9583ed75078cca5bf7c8316d6b4830f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,100,83,124,149,131,237,117,7,140,202,91,247,200,49,109,107,72,48,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
