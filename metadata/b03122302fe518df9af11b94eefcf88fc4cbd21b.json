Based on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s years of teaching and research experience in the physical chemistry of food, this book offers the necessary depth of information and mathematical bases presented in a clear manner for individuals with minimal physical chemistry background.\n\nThe text begins with basic physical chemistry concepts, building a foundation of knowledge so readers can then grasp the physical chemistry of food, including processes such as crystallization, melting, distillation, blanching, and homogenization as well as rheology and emulsion and foam stability. The chapters cover thermodynamic systems, temperature, and ideal gases versus real gases; chemical thermodynamics and the behavior of liquids and solids, along with phase transitions; and the thermodynamics of small molecule and macromolecule dispersions and solutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03122302fe518df9af11b94eefcf88fc4cbd21b","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+the+Physical+Chemistry+of+Foods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03122302fe518df9af11b94eefcf88fc4cbd21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,49,34,48,47,229,24,223,154,241,27,148,238,252,248,143,196,203,210,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
