Here&amp;#039;s Steve Wynn&amp;#039;s genius compressed down to 15 songs.  \n\nDream Syndicate are at the foundation (alongside the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and R.E.M.) of contemporary alternative music sheerly because at the time when most bands were experimenting with new technology, the Syndicate deigned to bring back the guitar. Fronted by Steve Wynn (b. Feb. 21, 1960) and including Karl Precoda (guitar), Dennis Duck (drums) and Kendra Smith (bass), the band formed in Los Angeles after Smith and Wynn had relocated there from Davis, CA. They debuted with a self-titled, unbelievably Velvet Underground-like EP on Wynn&amp;#039;s own Down There label. It was shortly off to Ruby/Slash for Days of Wine and Roses, the most lauded record on the college charts that year. The record has been cited as influential from artists as diverse as Kurt Cobain to the Black Crowes&amp;#039; Chris Robinson. Live, they had developed into an assaultive guitar band prone to jamming which helped earn them the tag as leaders of L.A.&amp;#039;s Paisley Underground movement.\n\nTrack Listing:\nWhen You Smile\nTell Me When It&amp;#039;s Over\nThat&amp;#039;s What You Always Say\nHalloween\nThe Days of Wine and Roses\nBurn\nThe Medicine Show\nMerrittville\n50 in a 25 Zone\nBoston\nNow I Ride Alone\nLet It Rain\nThe Side&amp;#039;ll Never Show\nLoving the Sinner, Hating the Sin\nI Have Faith\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1cd39f424d414a89311bd69f3a1cfab4193062","amp;dn":"Dream+Syndicate+-+Tell+Me+When+It%5C%27s+Over+%281992%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1cd39f424d414a89311bd69f3a1cfab4193062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,28,211,159,66,77,65,74,137,49,27,214,159,58,28,250,180,25,48,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
