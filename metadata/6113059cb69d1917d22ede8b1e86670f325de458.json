The source files were pretty good, so these new ones are as well. But Public Opinion contains some underlning.\n\n\nabout the author (from wikipedia):\n\nWalter Lippmann (September 23, 1889 - December 14, 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War; he coined the term stereotype in the modern psychological meaning as well. Lippmann won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for his syndicated newspaper column &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot; and one for his 1961 interview of Nikita Khruschev.\n\nTo Lippmann's mind, democratic ideals had deteriorated, voters were largely ignorant about issues and policies, they lacked the competence to participate in public life and cared little for participating in the political process. In Public Opinion (1922), Lippmann noted that the stability the government achieved during the patronage era of the 19th century was threatened by modern realities. He wrote that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“governing classÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ must rise to face the new challenges.\n\nNoam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman used one of Lippmann's catch phrases -- the &quot;Manufacture of Consent&quot; -- for the title of their book, Manufacturing Consent, which contains sections critical of Lippmann's views about the media.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6113059cb69d1917d22ede8b1e86670f325de458","amp;dn":"Walter+Lippmann+%283+books%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6113059cb69d1917d22ede8b1e86670f325de458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,19,5,156,182,157,25,23,210,46,222,139,30,134,103,15,50,93,228,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
