Information security experts worldwide use penetration techniques to evaluate enterprise defenses.\nIn Penetration Testing, security expert, researcher, and trainer Georgia Weidman introduces you to the core skills and techniques that every pentester needs. Using a virtual machineÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased lab that includes Kali Linux and vulnerable operating systems, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll run through a series of practical lessons with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite. As you follow along with the labs and launch attacks, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll experience the key stages of an actual assessmentÃ¢â‚¬â€including information gathering, finding exploitable vulnerabilities, gaining access to systems, post exploitation, and more.\nLearn how to:\n\n    Crack passwords and wireless network keys with brute-forcing and wordlists\n    Test web applications for vulnerabilities\n    Use the Metasploit Framework to launch exploits and write your own Metasploit modules\n    Automate social-engineering attacks\n    Bypass antivirus software\n    Turn access to one machine into total control of the enterprise in the post exploitation phase\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even explore writing your own exploits. Then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on to mobile hackingÃ¢â‚¬â€WeidmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particular area of researchÃ¢â‚¬â€with her tool, the Smartphone Pentest Framework.\nWith its collection of hands-on lessons that cover key tools and strategies, Penetration Testing is the introduction that every aspiring hacker needs.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nForeward by Peter Van Eeckhoutte\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIntroduction\n\nPenetration Testing Primer\n\nPart 1: The Basics\nChapter 1: Setting Up Your Virtual Lab\nChapter 2: Using Kali Linux\nChapter 3: Programming\nChapter 4: Using the Metasploit Framework\n\nPart 2: Assessments\nChapter 5: Information Gathering\nChapter 6: Finding Vulnerabilities\nChapter 7: Capturing Traffic\n\nPart 3: Attacks\nChapter 8: Exploitation\nChapter 9: Password Attacks\nChapter 10: Client-Side Exploitation\nChapter 11: Social Engineering\nChapter 12: Bypassing Antivirus Applications\nChapter 13: Post Exploitation\nChapter 14: Web Application Testing\nChapter 15: Wireless Attacks\n\nPart 4: Exploit Development\nChapter 16: A Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Linux\nChapter 17: A Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Windows\nChapter 18: Structured Exception Handler Overwrites\nChapter 19: Fuzzing, Porting Exploits, and Metasploit Modules\n\nPart 5: Mobile Hacking\n\nChapter 20: Using the Smartphone Pentest Framework\n\nResources\n\nIndex\n\n\n\nNote: This is the official PDF!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8e7107553a8650c217e43cd8e55ca8be81af0c","amp;dn":"Penetration+Testing+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8e7107553a8650c217e43cd8e55ca8be81af0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,142,113,7,85,58,134,80,194,23,228,60,216,229,92,168,190,129,175,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
