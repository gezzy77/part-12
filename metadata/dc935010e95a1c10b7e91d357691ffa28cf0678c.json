Although there are not long derivations or detailed methods for specific engineering calculations, the reader should be familiar and comfortable with basic computational techniques. This text is not a ''cookbook'' for producing DOEs, but it should provide readers with sufficient information to assess whether this technology would benefit their work, and to understand the requirements for using the concepts and techniques presented by the authors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc935010e95a1c10b7e91d357691ffa28cf0678c","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Diffractive+Optics+Design%2C+Fabrication%2C+and+Test+%28T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc935010e95a1c10b7e91d357691ffa28cf0678c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,147,80,16,233,90,28,16,183,233,29,53,118,145,255,162,140,240,103,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
