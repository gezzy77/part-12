Two bonus tracks were included, and new liner notes from Bono. The bonus tracks were a rehearsal of &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; from 1969, for Sinatra's eponymous Emmy Award nominated 1969 television special, Sinatra, and a live 1987 performance of &quot;My Way&quot; at the Reunion Arena, Dallas, Texas.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5949ba4204fc6b933fd4f4213501105be8b6563","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+My+Way+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5949ba4204fc6b933fd4f4213501105be8b6563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,148,155,164,32,79,198,185,51,253,79,66,19,80,17,5,190,139,101,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
