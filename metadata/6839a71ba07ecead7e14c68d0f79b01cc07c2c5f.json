Harris finds out porn producer Tommy Fox gave her a casting couch, while Fox' partner Steele brought his own woman to the same bed. Forbes doesn't accept Harris' argument that this is reason enough not to want her. Showing Forbes her &quot;Private Secretary&quot; loop with a &quot;Mr. Tat&quot; doesn't help either. Harris then learns Barbie's lover Anton introduced her to madam Patty who seduced Barbie into prostitution. Patty told her prostitute to learn from Barbie, as Tommy Fox, Steele and his women and client Bentley all joined in. Harris locates Barbie, but learns she is a person who makes her own choices in life. Can he overcome his judgmental views and find true love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6839a71ba07ecead7e14c68d0f79b01cc07c2c5f","amp;dn":"Whatever+Happened+to+Miss+September+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6839a71ba07ecead7e14c68d0f79b01cc07c2c5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,57,167,27,160,126,206,173,126,20,198,141,15,121,176,28,192,124,44,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
