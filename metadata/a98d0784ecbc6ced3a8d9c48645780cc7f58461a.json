The Sky Beckons or \r\nThe Heavens Beckon) is a Soviet science-fiction feature film, produced by \r\nAleksandr Kozyr and Mikhail Karyukov, and filmed at the Dovzhenko Film Studios \r\nin 1959.\r\n\r\nA Soviet scientific expedition is being prepared as the world's first mission to \r\nplanet Mars. Their space ship Homeland has been built at a space station, where \r\nthe expedition awaits the command to start.\r\n\r\nAn American ship Typhoon experiencing mechanical problems arrives at the same \r\nspace station, secretly having the same plans for the conquest of the Red \r\nPlanet. Trying to stay ahead of the Soviets, they start without proper \r\npreparation, and soon are again in distress.\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n   The Sky Calls is available on Youtube.  That's where I saw it after watching \r\na favorite called &quot;Tumarest Andromedy&quot;  numerous times.  I have made the torrent \r\nso that interested viewers have time to study the film for it's quality and early use of many techniques for science \r\nfiction adopted  later in the West.  Also the Youtube says Eng subs but has \r\nnone.\r\n\r\n   This is a very small size file which I prefer since it can complete quickly.\r\nStandard free tools are used to encode from the original (which was very large)\r\nto what you see.\r\n\r\n   VLC media player can load the optional subtitle file from it's option at top\r\nof screen.\r\n\r\nNotes written September 3rd,  2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98d0784ecbc6ced3a8d9c48645780cc7f58461a","amp;dn":"The+Sky+Calls++%28Nebo+Zovyot%29++USSR+1959++Russian+%2C+Eng+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98d0784ecbc6ced3a8d9c48645780cc7f58461a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,141,7,132,236,188,108,237,58,141,156,72,100,87,128,204,127,88,70,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
