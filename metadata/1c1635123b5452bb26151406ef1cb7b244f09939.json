The story is simply told and allowed to stand on its own. The story is one of those that would not be believable on the big screen if it were not true in all of its essential points. The beautiful jungle scenery (the movie was shot in Panama) is well worth the price of the ticket. But the story will make you think about how self-giving love is more powerful than violence. The story also shows that extraordinary risks taken for peace can pay dividends beyond imagination. This will be a movie that people will be talking about, and watching again and again, far into the future. You&amp;#039;ll be sorry if you don&amp;#039;t take the opportunity to see it on the big screen. You&amp;#039;ll also wonder why an independent film company can make such a wonderful movie when Hollywood is making bad movies based on old TV shows. \n--------------------------------\n\nTruly Moving Picture, 16 January 2006\n10/10\nAuthor: tollini from United States\n\nI am a judge for the Indianapolis-based Heartland Film Festival. This feature film is a Crystal Heart Award Winner and won the $50,000 Grand Prize in October of 2005. The Heartland Film Festival is a non-profit that honors Truly Moving Pictures. A Truly Moving Picture &quot;ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.&quot;\n\nThe film, which is based on a true story, starts in 1956 in the Amazon basin in Ecuador. Five missionaries are savagely killed by a primitive tribe. But that is the beginning of the story and not the end of the story.\n\nThe missionaries&amp;#039; wives and children take on the work of their fathers and husbands. They and we, the audience, are forced to examine violence and how we react to violence and the possibility of forgiving the perpetrators of violence.\n\nThe missionaries and their families display incredible human traits. They display courage in the face of danger ÃƒÂ¢?? they are willing to sacrifice a normal life to help others ÃƒÂ¢?? they show respect and tolerance to primitive people. But most impressive of all, they retain their humility and do not look down on others.\n\nThe cinematography and music are stunning. The Amazon jungle becomes the third character along with the tribe and the missionaries. And all three characters relentlessly attempt to survive and prevail.\n\nFYI ÃƒÂ¢?? There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Crystal Heart winners that are now either at the theater or available on video. \n--------------------------------\n\nThis film rocks, 5 December 2005\nAuthor: ricroc-1 from United States\n\nI had a chance to view this film at the National Missionary Convention. All I have to say about it....IT ROCKS! A great film. Very inspiring. I will see it again and I will spend top dollar to see it. When it is available to purchase, I will be the first in line. The film was beautifully made, and was true to the actual story of the five missionaries who gained their lives by reaching the Waodani. I was moved, shocked, brought to tears as I viewed this realistic portrayal. I would not recommend allowing children under 10 to view. Nothing horrific, just some hard imagery to digest. Would open the door for 20 questions after they viewed the film. I am going to allow my 10 year to see it. Again...GREAT FILM!!! GREAT MESSAGE,\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n----------------------------------------\n\nCritic&amp;#039;s Choice! a new era in movie making, 18 January 2006\n10/10\nAuthor: filmcritic54 from NYC\n\nAbsolutely amazing cinematography and storyline, and best of all the story isn&amp;#039;t made up, its a true to life story shown from the tribe&amp;#039;s point of view. The quality of the film is superb. The storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense through the entire movie. There are also some bonus &quot;blooper&quot; clips played during the credits of the movie. You would not know that director Jim Hanon was a first time director but rather you would think he had been in the business for years. This film will help inspire the way future films are shot and created. This also highlights and shows some insight into the burgeoning film industry coming out of Oklahoma City. This scene is set to take off and provide Hollywood with a new generation of film makers.\n\nReconciliation is the word that best describes this captivating film. Most people can forgive someone but they don&amp;#039;t move on or exclude people from their lives. This true to life story gives a glimpse into Steve Saint&amp;#039;s life. His father Nate Saint, was one of the 5 men brutally killed to death in 1956 by a Waodani tribesman. Today, he travels the world with the exact man that killed his father back then. In fact, he even considers him family and calls him &quot;grandfather&quot;. To forgive someone is one thing, to show our violent society how to be completely reconciled with one another can rarely be said in today&amp;#039;s world. Go see this true story and decide for yourself!!!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n--------------------------------------\n\nOutstanding Film &amp; Story!!!!!, 13 January 2006\n9/10\nAuthor: movielover-23 from New York City\n\nCould you truly love the people that killed your family members and friends? What if it was a gross misunderstanding (can anyone say Iraq War)? The kind of stuff more movies should be made of! I got to attend a screening here in NYC that apparently coincided with the 50th anniversary of this true event.\n\nI&amp;#039;m not sure why or how this movie has escaped the attention of most major media. The movie websites says it&amp;#039;s releasing in 1,200 theaters in a week. Maybe the media is biased because part of the story is about missionaries. I don&amp;#039;t know about the rest of you, but this is the first movie I&amp;#039;ve been to in a while that is actually worth $9 for a ticket.\n\nI think most people might think that loving your father&amp;#039;s killer is a little sick, but when the movie unfolds and you understand the clash between the two cultures, it make sense.\n\nIf you like The Mission (Robert Dinero, Jeremy Irons), Chariots of Fire, or Last of the Mohicans, you will enjoy this movie!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n----------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1635123b5452bb26151406ef1cb7b244f09939","amp;dn":"The+End+of+the+Spear+%282005%29+English+subs+%5BH264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1635123b5452bb26151406ef1cb7b244f09939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,22,53,18,59,84,82,187,38,21,20,6,239,28,183,178,68,240,153,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
