They end up in the quaint Amish community of Sugarcreek, Ohio under a set of aliases and with a broken-down old truck. Three Amish sisters running an old farmhouse inn take them under their wings and employ Micah as a handyman. This sparks the suspicions of a Sugarcreek policewoman named Rachel Troyler, niece of the three who raised her after she was orphaned as a child. Will the truth interfere with love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:748df0f8e5e67ad105144f2b0a772d7df3b87afd","amp;dn":"Love+Finds+You+In+Sugarcreek+%282014%29+720p+HDTV+X264+Solar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"748df0f8e5e67ad105144f2b0a772d7df3b87afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,141,240,248,229,230,122,209,5,20,79,43,10,119,45,125,243,184,122,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
