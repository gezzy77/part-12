Some of these had gotten no further than the so-called &quot;build-reel&quot; stage. It was at this preliminary phase that the artist had done little more than set aside various and sundry audio on the back-burner in his Utility Muffin Research Kitchen home studio. One Shot Deal (2008) is a single-CD compilation taken from a number of disparate sources -- including a pair of tunes from Zappa's &quot;build reels.&quot; As the set's co-producer Gail Zappa explains in her inimitable style in the brief liner notes essay &quot;...the guitar was the main element for me....&quot; With that as an unofficial mandate, the 5-plus minutes -- which cover the meaty nine-year span of 1972 to 1981 -- is undeniably fret-centric.\n\nThe opening &quot;Bathtub Man&quot; -- featuring the early to mid-'70s George Duke (keyboards/vocals) and Napoleon Murphy Brock (vocals) lineup -- seems to be an instrumental improvisational extension that was nicked from &quot;Cosmik Debris.&quot; Not only does it reveal a bit of insight into what is presumably a transvestite tale from the road, but musically it displays both Duke and Zappa's criminally underrated chops as incendiary interpreters of the blues. \n\nThe brief yet frenetic &quot;Space Boogers&quot; is another sonic matchup between Duke and Zappa that presents their unique interaction in a very different -- yet no less inspired -- context. Presumably with baton in hand, the percussive &quot;Hermitage&quot; is an extract from a rare performance of &quot;Sink Trap&quot; (aka &quot;Gypsy Airs&quot;) by the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra from a show at Royce Hall on the campus of UCLA in mid-September 1975. While several portions of the nearly ten-minute suite have surfaced -- most notably during the Tinseltown Rebellion (1981) version of &quot;Easy Meat&quot; and as &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot; on the DVD-A QuAUDIOPHILIAc (2004) -- the entire work has yet to be issued. The spacy and jazz fusion-filled &quot;Trudgin' Across the Tundra&quot; is a sampling of the &quot;Petite (as opposed to Grand) Wazoo&quot; combo with Gary Barone (trumpet) wailing ÃƒÂ  la Miles Davis during the &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; era. Another of One Shot Deal's heartier endeavors is the nine-plus minute &quot;Occam's Razor&quot; -- which consists of Zappa's guitar solo from the song &quot;Inca Roads&quot; during a concert at the Rhein-Neckarhalle in Eppelheim, Germany on March 21, 1979. \n\nKeen-eared Zappa-philes might recognize portions from the Joe's Garage (1979) tune &quot;Toad-O Line&quot; and even a few riffs of the Toto pop hit &quot;Hold the Line,&quot; which is quoted fairly blatantly. &quot;Heidelberg&quot; continues with a twist as the heart of &quot;Yo' Mama&quot; is torn out at the same venue Rhein-Neckarhalle in Eppelheim, Germany -- from 11 months earlier on February 24, 1978. From the '80s is &quot;The Illinois Enema Bandit&quot; circa Halloween 1981 -- the visuals of which can be found on the Torture Never Stops (2008) DVD. The lengthy &quot;Australian Yellow Snow&quot; is a real delicacy for enthusiasts of Zappa's incorrigible sense of humor and singular storytelling. The seminal installments of &quot;Don't Eat the Yellow Snow,&quot; &quot; Nanook Rubs It,&quot; and &quot;St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast&quot; are excellent as is the extended &quot;Mar-Juh-Rene&quot; rap. Bringing One Shot Deal to a fitting conclusion is the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra's rendering of &quot;Rollo&quot; from the Royce Hall gig that yielded &quot;Hermitage.&quot; By the way, curious parties are encouraged to check out the highly recommended and significantly lengthier take of the song as heard on the aforementioned DVD-A QuAUDIOPHILIAc(2004). \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
