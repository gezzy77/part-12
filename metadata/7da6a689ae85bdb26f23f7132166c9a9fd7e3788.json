He'd been interested in music since childhood and begun to learn playing the piano in the age of seven.\n\nHe bound his fate with KrakÃƒÂ³w though, where he moved to study architecture. There Grechuta met his future friend Jan Kanty PawluÃ…â€ºkiewicz with whom he decided to start a cabaret group in the manner of Piwnica pod Baranami (an artistic bohema in KrakÃƒÂ³w which lasts to this day). This cabaret, which took the name Anawa (from french en avant which means &quot;forward&quot;), begun to perform in a student club &quot;Bambuko&quot;. The first decent success came with the performance on Festiwal Piosenki Studenckiej in 1967. Marek Grechuta took the second place in this contest behind a young student from Warszawa - Maryla Rodowicz (who later also became a famous singer in Poland). The final of the contest was broadcast live by the television what enabled the young archtecture student to be seen by the whole Poland. The next important event for Marek Grechuta was partaking in FAMA Festival where the young artist won the first prize.\n\nThis two successes led him to perform on the most important contest in Poland in that time which was the Festival in Opole. In the next year, 1970, Marek Grechuta released his debut album called simply &quot;Marek Grechuta &amp; Anawa&quot; (predated by a 4-song EP in 1969). It was a mix of cabaret, lyrical songs with neobaroque sound so characteristic, as it turned out later, for Anawa.\n\nIn 1971 Marek Grechuta and Jan Kanty PawluÃ…â€ºkiewicz recorded their second album titled &quot;KorowÃƒÂ³d&quot; which is considered one of the most important in the history of Polish popular music. It contained two songs regarded as generation hymns - &quot;Ã…Å¡wiecie nasz&quot; and title &quot;KorowÃƒÂ³d&quot;. This album made Marek Grechuta a star!\n\nDespite all this successes the band suddenly broke up. Marek Grechuta and Jan Kanty PawluÃ…â€ºkiewicz split. As Grechuta admitted himself there were too many individualities in the group so it couldn't last long.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da6a689ae85bdb26f23f7132166c9a9fd7e3788","amp;dn":"Marek+Grechuta+-+Droga+za+widnokres+%281972%2F1991%29+%5BAPE%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da6a689ae85bdb26f23f7132166c9a9fd7e3788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,166,166,137,174,133,189,178,111,35,247,19,33,102,201,169,253,126,55,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
