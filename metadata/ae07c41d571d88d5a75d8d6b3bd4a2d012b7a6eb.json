Patton\nCategory: Academic/Religion\nPublisher: University of California Press (June 27, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0520240871\nISBN-13: 978-0520240872\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - &quot;This elegantly written book introduces a new perspective on Indic religious history by rethinking the role of mantra in Vedic ritual. In Bringing the Gods to Mind, Laurie Patton takes a new look at mantra as &quot;performed poetry&quot; and in five case studies draws a portrait of early Indian sacrifice that moves beyond the well-worn categories of &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;magico-religious&quot; thought in Vedic sacrifice. Treating Vedic mantra as a sophisticated form of artistic composition, she develops the idea of metonymy, or associational thought, as a major motivator for the use of mantra in sacrificial performance. Filling a long-standing gap in our understanding, her book provides a history of the Indian interpretive imagination and a study of the mental creativity and hermeneutic sophistication of Vedic religion.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;Patton does a remarkable job in opening the worlds of Vedic and Indological study. Enhanced by Patton's flashes of beauty and humor, the book is sure to become a standard read.&quot; - Jeffrey J. Kripal, Rice University; \n\n&quot;Bringing the Gods to Mind is extremely important to the field.&quot; - Whitney Sanford, Iowa State University&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains the original retail quality PDF as well as excellent conversions into EPUB, MOBI, AZW3 and LIT formats done in Calibre.
