They wrote most of their own songs, played their own instruments, and sang with assured and beautiful voices. They wrote songs about social issues, tackled religious themes, and dipped a toe (pinky toe) into psychedelia, and when they were given a song by an outside writer they made it a smash hit. Their lush vocal harmonies owed much to groups like the Association and the Beach Boys, and they were sweet -- sweet without being innocuous, light without being lightweight. This CD has their three big hits -- &quot;Indian Lake,&quot; the truly fantastic &quot;The Rain, the Park and Other Things,&quot; and &quot;Hair&quot; (which should be the worst song ever but the Cowsills pull it off because they have such great voices) -- and a bunch of sunshine pop gems. &quot;Poor Baby&quot; sounds like a lost Beach Boys single and &quot;We Can Fly&quot; is a great song that should have been a big hit. The only complaint one might have is that some of the production seems a little unimaginative. It would have been very interesting to get the Cowsills and their songs into a studio with a producer like Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, or even Brian Wilson to see what kind of magic might have occurred. Still, the Cowsills were so much more than just a kiddie band or the model for the Partridge Family. This CD proves it. \n\nMore info here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc09.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifoxqwhldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc09.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifoxqwhldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHowever, while the tracks match, the picture and date at the All Music site don't match.\n\nTracks:\n\n01 - The Rain, The Park, And Other Things\n02 - The Path Of Love\n03 - Meet Me At The Wishing Well\n04 - In Need Of A Friend\n05 - Mister Flynn\n06 - Captain Sad And His Ship Of Fools\n07 - We Can Fly\n08 - Indian Lake\n09 - Gray, Sunny Day\n10 - A Time For Remembrance\n11 - Gotta Get Away From It All\n12 - Newspaper Blanket\n13 - Poor Baby\n14 - Hair\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ca102fe64ed376c5e8c4c0304e7c488bc13776","amp;dn":"The+Cowsills+-+The+Best+Of+The+Cowsills+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ca102fe64ed376c5e8c4c0304e7c488bc13776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,202,16,47,230,78,211,118,197,232,196,192,48,78,124,72,139,193,55,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
