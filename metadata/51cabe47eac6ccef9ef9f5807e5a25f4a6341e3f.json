A city that once made history with its divisive wall teems today with an overwhelming array of innovative chefs offering delicious seasonal creations like pureed sunflower seeds, Jerusalem artichoke flans and crushed frozen pine nuts. Loved by the likes of Garbo, Charlie Chaplin and Escoffier there's still a cornucopia of choice for those with a more traditional temperament, with Eisbein, meatballs and sausages topping every menu in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 06-May-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51cabe47eac6ccef9ef9f5807e5a25f4a6341e3f","amp;dn":"Rick+Steins+Long+Weekends+S01E03+Berlin+PDTV.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51cabe47eac6ccef9ef9f5807e5a25f4a6341e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,202,190,71,234,198,204,239,158,249,245,128,126,90,37,244,166,52,30,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
