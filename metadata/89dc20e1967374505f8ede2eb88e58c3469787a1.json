Not only did it stimulate and rejuvenate to an almost unbelievable extent, but it was directly responsible for giving pop music a character and artistic quality which had never before been associated with the idiom. And it was the cause of Britain becoming the hub of the pop music world instead of America, which had been hitherto been recognised as the centre of pop activities. Within a few months of their chart debut, the whole of Britain was in the grip of a contagious fever... Beatlemania. It was a fever that was soon to engulf the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89dc20e1967374505f8ede2eb88e58c3469787a1","amp;dn":"The+London+Starlight+Orchestra+-+Plays+20+Beatles+Greatest+Hits+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89dc20e1967374505f8ede2eb88e58c3469787a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,220,32,225,150,115,116,80,95,142,222,46,184,142,88,195,70,151,135,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
