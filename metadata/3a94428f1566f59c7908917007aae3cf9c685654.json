Google Chrome also uses a brand new javascript engine (V8), which is much faster than existing javascript interpreters. This means you can create more complex and more intensive AJAX applications with fewer speed and processing constraints. Finally, Google Chrome is built on top of Blink (WebKit fork), so Google Chrome users will benefit from the CSS3 features being added to Blink (WebKit fork) as those features are released.\r\n\r\nFeatures:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ One window for any task\r\nâ€¢ Application shortcuts\r\nâ€¢ Dynamic tabs\r\nâ€¢ Control failures\r\nâ€¢ Incognito mode\r\nâ€¢ Integration with Google Gears\r\nâ€¢ For each tab in a separate process was enshrined\r\nâ€¢ Timely updates to programme components.\r\nâ€¢ Instant bookmark\r\nâ€¢ Import settings from other browsers\r\nâ€¢ A simplified download process\r\nâ€¢ Safe browsing\r\nâ€¢ Use the simple and fast rendering WebKit HTML\r\nâ€¢ Multilanguage support and easy to use browser\r\nâ€¢ Multithreading and absence of hangs browser","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a94428f1566f59c7908917007aae3cf9c685654","amp;dn":"Google+Chrome+v48.0.2564.103+Stable+%28x86+%26amp%3B+x64%29+%7BB4tman%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a94428f1566f59c7908917007aae3cf9c685654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,148,66,143,21,102,245,156,121,8,145,112,7,170,227,207,156,104,86,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
