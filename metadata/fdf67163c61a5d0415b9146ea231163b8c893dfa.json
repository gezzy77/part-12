On the eve of her wedding, the beautiful opera singer Malvina is mysteriously killed and abducted by a malevolent Dr. Droz. Felisberto, an innocent piano tuner, is summoned to Droz?s secluded villa to service his strange musical automatons. Little by little Felisberto learns of the doctor?s plans to stage a ?diabolical opera? and of Malvina?s fate. He secretly conspires to rescue her, only to become trapped himself in the web of Droz?s perverse universe...\n\nStarring Amira Casar (Catherine Breillat?s ANATOMY OF HELL), Assumpta Serna (Pedro Almodovar?s MATADOR), Cesar Sarachu (INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA) and Gottfried John (Fassbinder?s MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN).&quot;\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes):                           732,870,656                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g \\&quot;AVI\\&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g \\&quot;OpenDML\\&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             33          \nPreload (in ms):                                504       \nAudio alignment(\\&quot;split across interleaves\\&quot;):    Aligned         \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. \\&quot;DIV3\\&quot;):                  xvid              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. \\&quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion\\&quot;):    XviD              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            01:35:12                \nFrame Count:                                    171195             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          320                  \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (\\&quot;DAR\\&quot;):                   2.250                     \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           907                 \nMPEG-4 (\\&quot;MPEG-4\\&quot; or \\&quot;\\&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (\\&quot;B-VOP\\&quot; or \\&quot;\\&quot;):                          B-VOP          \n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
