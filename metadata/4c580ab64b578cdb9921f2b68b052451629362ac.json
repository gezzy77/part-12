How would our habits change if we shed the excess of money, clutter, and food in our lives? In More or Less, readers will learn how to draw a line of Ã¢â‚¬Å“enoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in their consumer choices, how to see generosity as a chance to experience freedom in a greedy world, and how to make small changes now that will help others forever. As Shinabarger reminds them, defining Ã¢â‚¬Å“enoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is more than a responsibilityÃ¢â‚¬â€it is an opportunity to give hope. With a foreword by Bob Goff.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c580ab64b578cdb9921f2b68b052451629362ac","amp;dn":"More+or+Less%3A+Choosing+a+Lifestyle+of+Excessive+Generosity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c580ab64b578cdb9921f2b68b052451629362ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,88,10,182,75,87,140,219,153,33,242,182,139,5,36,81,98,147,98,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
