He followed with &quot;There, I've Said It Again&quot; and &quot;Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!&quot; in 1945, &quot;Ballerina,&quot; in 1947 and most famously, &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot; in 1949.  In the 1950s, Monroe tried to move into the singing cowboy genre but his rich baritone was a poor match for the fruity-friendly-good-guy role.  Although he continued to perform into the early 70s he never hit the charts again.\n\nIn the 40s and 50s, it was said that a recording artist knew that he'd made the big time when Spike Jones and his City Slickers &quot;murdered&quot; (parodied) one of his songs.  Jones effectively murdered Monroe's &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot; in 1949, and I've included the track in this torrent.\n\nTrack Listing - Disc 1\n1.  Blue Moon\n2.  Shine on Harvest Moon\n3.
