The result is ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Frightening, their second full-length album. \nIt plays like a classic reel of tape from start to finish. Opening with the visceral drums of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPercussion Gun,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it is clear that time-off from the road has served the band well. The many highlights include the emotional centerpiece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCompany I Keep,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the new sonic territory of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLionesseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the macabre lyrics of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRight Where They Left.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fans of Fort Nightly will find much to go weak in the knees over and new listeners are in for an awakening as White Rabbits flip the switch on an already impressive beginning. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Frightening is a journey into the playfully dark musings of Everyman.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b76e5d3aa9d7f18c4133603c3685f02fa206890","amp;dn":"White+Rabbits+-+It%5C%27s+Frightening+%5Bmp3-160-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b76e5d3aa9d7f18c4133603c3685f02fa206890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,118,229,211,170,157,127,24,196,19,54,3,195,104,95,2,250,32,104,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
