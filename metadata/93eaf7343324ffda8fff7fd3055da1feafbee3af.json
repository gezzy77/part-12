This album began as a series of rehearsals for collaboration on a Blind Boys of Alabama record. Recorded in two sessions, the vibe in the room was loose and creative enough that the two acts ended up with an album of collaborative material for joint release. And this is a collaboration in the truest sense of the word. It's not just Ben playing gospel, or the Blind Boys of Alabama singing on a Ben Harper record. These ten tunes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with seven Harper originals written specifically for the sessions, the rest traditional gospel tunes and covers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ showcase Harper and the Innocent Criminals alongside the Blind Boys of Alabama. The album kicks off with Harper's &quot;Take My Hand,&quot; a funky gospel tune that showcases a Fender Rhodes and Harper's wah-wah pedal underscored by the call and response of the Blind Boys repeating the title after each sung line of the verse, before Clarence Fountain takes it out. &quot;Wicked Man&quot; is a Southern soul tune that has a Muscle Shoals groove and a beautiful vocal weave on the refrain. &quot;Church House Steps&quot; is pure gospel groove with a Hammond B3 and a smoking duet between the Blind Boys' layered harmonies and Harper on the verses with full-on blues feel in his singing and playing. There's a killer cover of the Bob Dylan/Danny O'Keefe tune, &quot;Well, Well, Well,&quot; with Delta blues bottleneck shimmering through the intertwined vocal lines. The deep, nocturnal sparseness of &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot; is a complete re-reading of the nugget with a swampy backbeat. And this album works beautifully. Nothing sounds forced, all of it loose and comfortable and the vocal performances on both sides are simply stellar. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\nAll songs written by Ben Harper except as noted.\n\n1. &quot;Take My Hand&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n2. &quot;Wicked Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n3. &quot;Where Could I Go&quot; (Ford, Harper, Yates) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n4. &quot;Church House Steps&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n5. &quot;11th Commandment&quot; (Harper, The Blind Boys of Alabama) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n6. &quot;Well, Well, Well&quot; (Dylan, O'Keefe) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n7. &quot;Picture of Jesus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n8. &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot; (Hayes, Rhodes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n9. &quot;Mother Pray&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n10. &quot;There Will Be a Light&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n11. &quot;Church on Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\n\n[Vinyl 180g][24bit-96kHz]\n\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\n\nNo declick or any other editing! \n\n\nMANY THX TO THE ORIGINAL RELEASER\n\n\nMORE INFO AT COLOMBO-RELOADED.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93eaf7343324ffda8fff7fd3055da1feafbee3af","amp;dn":"Ben+Harper+%26+The+Blind+Boys+Of+Alabama-There+Will+Be+A+Light%28200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93eaf7343324ffda8fff7fd3055da1feafbee3af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,234,247,52,51,36,255,218,143,255,127,211,5,93,161,254,175,190,227,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
