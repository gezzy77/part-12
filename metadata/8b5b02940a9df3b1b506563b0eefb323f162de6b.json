This 3-CD box set\ndiffers from many other recent Elvis releases spearheaded by Jorgensen and Semon for \none reason: it features all previously released material.   \n\nThe kicker? Even the most avid Elvis CD collectors don't seem to mind.\n\nThis immaculate, comprehensive set needs no previously unreleased tracks to entice   \nElvis CD junkies like me. Likewise, the listener needs not be an Elvis Presley fan - \nor even a fan of traditional gospel music - to enjoy this collection. \n\nThe music, digitally remastered from the original master tapes to produce the   \ncleanest, crispest sound to date, captures Elvis at his emotional and spiritual best.\nThis set proves that gospel provided an anchor for Elvis's musical repertoire from   \nday one, right up to the end. The consistency in vocal conviction from the &quot;Million  \nDollar Quartet&quot; sessions (recorded by a young Elvis on the brink of superstardom) to \nthe live version of &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; (recorded at one of Elvis's final concert   \nperformances) is both startling and revealing. It is indeed difficult to listen to   \nthese tracks and not feel swept away by the utterly convincing candor that carries   \nElvis's voice through every note.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing....:  \nCD1  \n\n  01.His hand in mine  [03:17]\n  02.I'm gonna walk dem golden   [01:52]\nstairs    \n  03.In my father's house   [02:05]\n  04.Milky white way   [02:15]\n  05.Known only to him [02:08]\n  06.I believe in the man in[02:12]\nthe sky   \n  07.Joshua fit the battle  [02:40]\n  08.He knows just what I need   [02:13]\n  09.Swing down, sweet chariot   [02:34]\n  10.Mansion over the hilltop    [02:57]\n  11.If we never meet again [01:59]\n  12.Working in the building[01:53]\n  13.Crying in the chapel   [02:26]\n  14.How great thou art[03:02]\n  15.In the garden[03:09]\n  16.Somebody bigger than you    [02:26]\nand I\n  17.Father along [04:05]\n  18.Stand by me  [02:29]\n  19.Without him  [02:30]\n  20.So high [01:57]\n  21.Where could I go but to[03:39]\nthe lord  \n  22.By and by    [01:51]\n  23.If the lord wasn't walking  [01:38]\nby my side\n  24.Run on  [02:22]\n  25.Where no one stands alone   [02:43]\n  26.We call on him    [02:33]\n  27.You'll never walk alone[02:44]\n  28.Who am I[03:17]\n  29.Life    [03:10]\n\nCD2  \n\n  01.Only believe [02:50]\n  02.He touched me[02:40]\n  03.I've got confidence    [02:21]\n  04.Amazing grace[03:36]\n  05.Seeing is believing    [02:54]\n  06.He is my everything    [02:40]\n  07.Bosom of abraham  [01:37]\n  08.An evening prayer [01:55]\n  09.Lead me guide me  [02:42]\n  10.There is no god but god[02:20]\n  11.A thing called love    [02:26]\n  12.I john  [02:17]\n  13.Reach out to jesus[03:15]\n  14.Miracle of the rosary  [01:51]\n  15.Put your hand in the hand   [03:15]\n  16.I got A feeling in my body  [03:34]\n  17.Help me [02:29]\n  18.If that isn't love[03:30]\n  19.Help me (live)    [02:37]\n  20.Why me lord (live)[02:51]\n  21.How great thou art (live)   [03:38]\n  22.Farther along[01:20]\n  23.Oh happy day [01:51]\n  24.I john  [02:16]\n  25.Bosom of abraham  [00:50]\n  26.You better run    [01:50]\n  27.Lead me guide me  [02:28]\n  28.Turn your eyes upon jesus   [03:43]\n\nCD3  \n\n  01.When the saints go[01:23]\nmarching in    \n  02.Just A little talk with[04:01]\njesus\n  03.Jesus walked that lonesome  [03:10]\nvalley    \n  04.I shall not be moved   [03:18]\n  05.Peace in the valley    [01:33]\n  06.Down by the riverside  [02:24]\n  07.Farther along[02:08]\n  08.Blessed jesus[01:13]\n(hold my hand) \n  09.On the jericho road    [00:49]\n  10.I just can't make it by[01:10]\nmyself    \n  11.I hear A sweet voice   [00:44]\ncalling   \n  12.When the saints go[02:20]\nmarching in    \n  13.Softly and tenderly    [02:35]\n  14.Peace in the valley    [03:21]\n  15.It is no secret   [03:55]\n(what god can do)   \n  16.I believe    [02:05]\n  17.Take my hand precious lord  [03:18]\n  18.I asked the lord  [01:18]\n  19.He [01:47]\n  20.Oh how I love jesus    [02:01]\n  21.Show me thy ways O lord[02:33]\n  22.Hide thou me [01:05]\n  23.Down by the riverside-When  [01:56]\nthe saints\n  24.Sing you children [02:14]\n  25.Swing down sweet chariot    [02:15]\n  26.Let us pray  [03:02]\n  27.Gospel medley[09:02]\n  28.The lords prayer  [02:07]\n  29.How great thou art (live)   [03:19]\n  30.Peace in the valley    [01:43]\n____ \n\n 219:31 min    \n  287,9 MB   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b5b02940a9df3b1b506563b0eefb323f162de6b","amp;dn":"Elvis_Presley-Peace_In_The_Valley-3CD-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b5b02940a9df3b1b506563b0eefb323f162de6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,91,2,148,10,157,243,177,181,6,86,59,14,239,179,35,241,98,222,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
