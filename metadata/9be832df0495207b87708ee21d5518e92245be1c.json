Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these &quot;regions of thought,&quot; but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.\n\nVernor Vinge first used the concepts of &quot;Zones of Thought&quot; in a 1988 novella, &quot;The Blabber&quot;, which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, A Deepness in the Sky, is a prequel to A Fire Upon the Deep set 20,000 years earlier and featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's Children of the Sky is &quot;a near-term sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;, set ten years later.\n\nVinge's former wife, Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought universe, based on his notes. These include &quot;The Outcasts of Heaven Belt&quot; and &quot;Legacy&quot;.\n\nVernor Vinge won a Hugo Award for A Fire Upon the Deep. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell and a Prometheus Award for A Deepness in the Sky.\n\n\nPublication order is as follows:\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep\nA Deepness in the Sky\nThe Children of the Sky\n\n\nChronological order is:\n\nA Deepness in the Sky\nA Fire Upon the Deep\nThe Children of the Sky\n\nSome say &quot;The first book can be read as a stand-alone. Book 3 is the continuation of book 1, and has less of the space opera element. Book 2 can be skipped from the story, or can be read as it's own book. In the timeline it is a prequel but it is loosely related to book 1.&quot;\n\nIncludes .mobi/.epub/.azw3/.lit/.pdf/.txt versions of:\nA Fire Upon the Deep\nA Deepness in the Sky\nThe Children of the Sky\nEnjoy and seed!\n /  ./_ __  _.    _\n/_,//_///_|///_/_","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9be832df0495207b87708ee21d5518e92245be1c","amp;dn":"Zones+of+Thought+Trilogy-Vernor+Vinge-LibrAriuS-epub-mobi%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9be832df0495207b87708ee21d5518e92245be1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,232,50,223,4,149,32,123,135,112,142,226,29,85,24,233,34,69,190,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
