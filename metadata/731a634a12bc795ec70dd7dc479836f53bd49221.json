By 1458 he left the Veneto and was never to return; he spent most of the remainder of his career in the March of Ancona, where he developed a distinctive personal style that makes a contrast to his Venetian contemporary Giovanni Bellini.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731a634a12bc795ec70dd7dc479836f53bd49221","amp;dn":"Carlo+Crivelli+1435+-+1495+%28Art+Painting%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731a634a12bc795ec70dd7dc479836f53bd49221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,26,99,74,18,188,121,94,199,13,215,220,71,152,54,245,59,212,146,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
