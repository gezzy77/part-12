J. Akbar traces the search for a &quot;Muslim space&quot; that began in the eighteenth century, and the events, people, circumstances, and mind-set that culminated in a fractured India in 1947. But why is Pakistan in danger of becoming a &quot;jelly state,&quot; a country that constantly quivers on the edge of instability? Akbar investigates contradictions in the nation's modern leadership, from Jinnah's secular ideals to the theocrats' clear stance on creating a &quot;sanctuary of Islam.&quot; He also offers an intimate appraisal of the young nation's future--including the global implications of nuclear armament and the harboring of terrorists like Osama bin Laden.\n\nTinderbox, a riveting and expansive biography of a nation, fills a crucial void in our understanding--even as the region's conflicts grow to affect the entire world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd09673fc3bfbbb4cc600d03d9776d4f77d3ac9","amp;dn":"Tinderbox+-+The+Past+and+Future+of+Pakistan+-+M.J.Akbar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd09673fc3bfbbb4cc600d03d9776d4f77d3ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,208,150,115,252,59,251,187,76,198,0,208,61,151,118,212,247,125,58,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
