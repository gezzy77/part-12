Pianist Earl Hines and singer Jimmy Rushing had crossed paths many times through the years, but this was their first joint recording; in addition, this was the first official recording by Hines' 1967-69 quartet, a unit also including Budd Johnson on tenor and soprano, bassist Bill Pemberton and drummer Oliver Jackson. Although getting co-billing, Rushing was really a guest on the date, appearing on just four of the nine numbers. Although he sounds a little raspy on &quot;Exactly Like You,&quot; Rushing is otherwise in prime form, also singing &quot;Am I Blue,&quot; &quot;Save It Pretty Mama&quot; and a rocking &quot;St. Louis Blues.&quot; Hines is typically brilliant on his &quot;One Night In Trinidad&quot; and rollicking on the multi-key &quot;Changin' the Blues,&quot; while the underrated Johnson shows just how distinctive he was on both of his horns.
