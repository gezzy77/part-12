I've converted them all to PDFs. Some of the links in the texts work; some do not.\n\nBrazil - Juruna Shamanism\nFemale Shamanism in Japan\nHunza Shamanism\nKorean Shamanistic Performance\nKuznetsova on Shamanism\nLiving Landscape of Knowledge\nNordic Shamanism\nShaman as the Zoomorphic Human\nShamanism and Medicine in Nepal\nShamanism and Rock Art\nShamanism and Art in the Himalayas\nShamanism in Afghanistan\nShamanism in Bangladesh\nShamanism in Nepal\nShamanism in the Rig Vedas\n\nA search on shamanism at archive.org returns over fifty items: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archive.org/search.php?query=shamanism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archive.org/search.php?query=shamanism&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAt the Internet Sacred Text Archive (sacred-texts.com), there are seven items:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sacred-texts.com/sha/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sacred-texts.com/sha/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\nOf course, it should be remembered that in general, shamanism is a pre-literary experience. In fact, there is a saying that as the books come in, the drums (used by the shamans) go out. I will soon be uploading some audios that emphasize experiencing shamanism yourself.\n\nCheck my torrents for reference works on shamanism and other topics, and, of course, please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa6c857e4301bda54e8833c77f0ae72b7ce137a","amp;dn":"Shamanism%3A+A+Miscellany","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa6c857e4301bda54e8833c77f0ae72b7ce137a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,166,200,87,228,48,27,218,84,232,131,60,119,240,174,114,183,206,19,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
