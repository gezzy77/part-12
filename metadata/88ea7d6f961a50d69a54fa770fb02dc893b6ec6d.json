His name is Cosmo and he is a young alien on his way to visit a world-famous amusement park with his parents. That is, until their ship is struck by a blazing \r\ncomet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet.\r\n\r\nWhile his Dad repairs the ship, Cosmo heads off to explore the strange planet. Upon returning, both his Mom and Dad are gone, and big, scary alien footprints are all around his ship! Oh no! Have Cosmo's parents been captured? Possibly to be eaten? Well, Cosmo is off to the rescue.\r\n\r\nCosmo's Cosmic Adventure is an exciting journey across a forbidden planet full of dangers and surprises. Cosmo is a lovable extra-terrestrial with a special ability: he has hands that work like suction cups! He can cling to walls, ledges, and all sorts of things. Using his suction hands, Cosmo is able to avoid dangers, scale cliffs and get to places other aliens can't reach. Can he save his parents before they're lightly seasoned and devoured?\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88ea7d6f961a50d69a54fa770fb02dc893b6ec6d","amp;dn":"Cosmo%27s+Cosmic+Adventure+%28v2.0.0.1%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88ea7d6f961a50d69a54fa770fb02dc893b6ec6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,234,125,111,150,26,80,214,154,84,250,119,15,176,45,200,147,182,236,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
