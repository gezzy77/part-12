I spent hours pouring through them, wondering to myself, How does she do this? With Tracis new book, The Art Journal Workshop, you get to see exactly how.Ã¢â‚¬â€Christine Olivarez, Somerset Studio\n\nMany people want to express themselves through visual journaling, but are stuck or intimidated with how to get started, what to write, or how to move beyond gluing down a few images or putting some paint on the paper.\n\nWith beautiful illustrations, The Art Journal Workshop breaks down the entire working process of journaling with step-by-step photos and instructions from start to finish. You'll learn how to use different media such as paint, photographs, and collage, while following journaling prompts and exercises to help you dig deeper and enrich the journaling process and experience. Traci Bunkers discusses the benefits of visual journaling, and walks you through battling a creative funk when you're feeling down or uninspired.\n\nTitle: The Art Journal Workshop: Break Through, Explore, and Make it Your Own\nAuthor: Traci Bunkers\nPublisher: Quarry Books\nYear: 2011\nFormat: PDF\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
