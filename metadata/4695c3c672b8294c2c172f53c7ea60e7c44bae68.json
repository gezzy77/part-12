Paris, May 2002: On Vel' d'Hiv's 60th anniversary, journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in France's past. Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her toSarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d'Hiv', to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins toquestion her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life. Tatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and silence that surround this painful episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4695c3c672b8294c2c172f53c7ea60e7c44bae68","amp;dn":"Sarah%27s+Key+-+Tatiana+de+Rosnay.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4695c3c672b8294c2c172f53c7ea60e7c44bae68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,149,195,198,114,184,41,76,44,23,47,83,199,234,96,231,196,75,174,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
