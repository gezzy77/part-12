On the day of her 18th birthday Liz undergoes a strange metamorphosis which, for reasons unknown, causes her to transform into the monster called Crush! As if growing up isn't hard enough without that, Liz soon has to deal with a deadly, ruthless agent tailing her... with teenage werewolves. At least she has her best friend, Jen Tanaka, to count on. And what at first seems to be a curse may be the very thing that leads her to understand who she truly is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6514f6f771f7fa77a93d9615daa6f5638fb7a2","amp;dn":"Crush+%28Rocket%2C+2004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6514f6f771f7fa77a93d9615daa6f5638fb7a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,101,20,246,247,113,247,250,119,169,61,150,21,218,166,245,99,143,183,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
