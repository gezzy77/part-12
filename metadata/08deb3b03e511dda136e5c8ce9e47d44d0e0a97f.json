Kisame is defeated, and Guy explains his technique. Yamato restrains him so Aoba can gather intel. When he's about to learn Tobi's identity, Kisame forces himself awake by biting off his own tongue. Kisame breaks free of his restraints and creates a water dome around himself. He recalls Itachi's words about learning what kind of person one is when they die. Knowing he's too weak to resist, and to prevent his enemies from gathering intel, Kisame summons sharks and allows himself to be eaten. The others are impressed by Kisame's resolution. When they open the scroll Kisame intended to deliver, it turns out to be a trap, leaving them stuck inside water prisons, while a summoned shark takes the scroll with the intel away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08deb3b03e511dda136e5c8ce9e47d44d0e0a97f","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+251+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08deb3b03e511dda136e5c8ce9e47d44d0e0a97f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,222,179,176,62,81,29,218,19,110,92,140,233,228,125,68,208,224,169,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
