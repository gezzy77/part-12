The eponymous main character is a charismatic Roma truck driver who works on a worldwide net of motorways as a freelance trader with his own large truck.\n\nThe Gipsy setting posits a near future (roughly several decades into the 21st Century) where ozone layer damage has forced all air travel to be abandoned (except for some airships), while the world is now spanned by an interconnected mega-motorway system called C3C. At the same time, global cooling has intensified, and large areas of the globe are covered in snow, inhospitable and difficult to cross, but also allowing land connections via the northern arctic.\n\nThis stylistic tool allows the series to imagine a globalized future world where it still takes weeks to travel to from one point to another, and where private truckers and megacorporations compete (and sometimes fight) over lucrative freight. It also allows the series individual books to be set pretty much anywhere in the world, often travelling through remote and dangerous areas. The comics have so far been set in the arctic from Alaska to Siberia, in Mongolia, fictional Middle Eastern and Latin American countries as well as in Germany.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8716/g1pugip00fc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8716/g1pugip00fc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4614/g1pugip10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4614/g1pugip10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9081/g2bugipsythefiresofsibe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9081/g2bugipsythefiresofsibe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9081/g2bugipsythefiresofsibe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9081/g2bugipsythefiresofsibe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/2645/g3gypsy301.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/2645/g3gypsy301.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/958/g3gypsy320.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/958/g3gypsy320.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/913/g4bdrgypsyblackeyes01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/913/g4bdrgypsyblackeyes01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3867/g4bdrgypsyblackeyes20.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3867/g4bdrgypsyblackeyes20.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/5095/g5ghmgypwhwing01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/5095/g5ghmgypwhwing01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/5575/g5ghmgypwhwing19.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/5575/g5ghmgypwhwing19.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/6564/g6ghvm0401035.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img213.imageshack.us/img213/6564/g6ghvm0401035.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/639/g6ghvm0401120.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/639/g6ghvm0401120.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b144f986c9074d32f620908e9e9bffef31e51814","amp;dn":"Gipsy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b144f986c9074d32f620908e9e9bffef31e51814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,68,249,134,201,7,77,50,246,32,144,142,158,155,255,239,49,229,24,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
