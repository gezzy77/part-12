Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...\n\nThe player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.\n\nLevels that have been visited before might become &quot;Expedition Missions&quot; which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.\n\n\nGame Description Drakengard 2:\n\nAfter the events of the first game, the world had become broken until Caim and the Red Dragon, Angelus restored the magical seals to hold back this devastation. In the eighteen years since, the Union has taken rule over the land and made prisoner the former soldiers of the Empire's forces. The priestess child Mannah has grown and lives in the company of these imprisoned forces. Among the Union forces, the Knights of the Seal were formed in dedication to the protection of the magical seals. General Oror of the Knights was on a campaign in the wilds when he came across a young boy, named Nowe, who was cared for and able to talk to the Blue Dragon, Legna. Deciding to raise the boy as his son, Oror brought both Nowe and Legna back to the Union. The Hierach leader, Seere recognized Nowe's potential and dubbed him &quot;The Savior&quot;. Over time, Nowe grew up among the knights and aspired to join their ranks. Now finally after many years and training, Nowe is ready to formally become a member of the Knights of the Seal...\n\nDrakengard 2 is a 3rd person role-playing action game like the first title. The player controls Nowe on his quest. The game is separated into two modes: Aerial combat and Ground combat. In Aerial Combat, Nowe rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Nowe, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. Each type of weapon can only be equipped by a specific character, and so changing to a new weapon might also change the playable character from Nowe to another member of his party. These weapons are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Accessories and items, such as healing and magic restore can also be found and used during combat. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Nowe is able to defeat enemies and earn experience. Defeated enemies drop items and coins, though weapons are only found in treasure chests. In ground combat, Nowe may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. \n\nProgress in the game is shown on the world map. Levels that have been visited before might become &quot;Expedition Missions&quot; which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Additionally, villages will appear which sell weapons and items in exchange for gold coins. Depending on Nowe's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are multiple endings to the game.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM. \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2c75f6d1fc4987018681c35e2d8ae1c1835e23","amp;dn":"Drakengard+1+%26+2+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2c75f6d1fc4987018681c35e2d8ae1c1835e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,44,117,246,209,252,73,135,1,134,129,195,94,45,138,225,193,131,94,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
