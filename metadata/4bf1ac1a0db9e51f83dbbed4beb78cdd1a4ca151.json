It was released worldwide in 1995 and was an international success, especially in Japan, where it achieved platinum status. Outside of Sweden and Japan (where debut Emmerdale had been released in 1994), the album was released as their first album as a compilation of tracks from both Emmerdale and Life. It was released in the United States under the label Minty Fresh Records.\n\nAnswers.com Review By John Bush, All Music Guide - With tongue firmly in cheek, the Cardigans decided to play up the candyfloss arrangements of their debut for second album Life. Where Emmerdale studied an introverted melancholy, Life is undiminished in both its independent-minded exuberance (&quot;Hey! Get Out of My Way&quot;) and zest to enjoy life with others (&quot;Daddy's Car,&quot; &quot;Gordon's Gardenparty&quot;). The incredible production and quality of arrangement from the debut are here also, even more strikingly crisp and spot-on. (Over 50 instruments were used on the 14 songs included on the Minty Fresh American release.) Though the Cardigans planned Life as something of a joke, it became one of the finest pop albums of the '90s.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Carnival\n[02] Gordon's Gardenparty\n[03] Daddy's Car\n[04] Sick &amp; Tired\n[05] Tomorrow\n[06] Rise And Shine\n[07] Beautiful One\n[08] Travelling With Charley\n[09] Fine\n[10] Celia Inside\n[11] Hey!
