Dunn\n\nStoryline\nThis is the second feature-length film containing classic Warner Brothers cartoons linked together by newly animated footage. It is divided into three parts, all of which are being shown in a theater as part of a film ceremony honoring the classic Looney Tunes characters. Part 1 involves Yosemite Sam's pact with the Devil to exchange his place in Hell with Bugs Bunny, provided that Sam can lure Bugs into sin and then kill him. Part 2 is a parody of TV crime-fighting dramas as Bugs is selected by law-enforcement to find and apprehend gangster Rocky, who has kidnaped Tweety Bird for a ransom. Part 3 is an Academy Awards-like contest in which various classic cartoon shorts are showcased. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaIpmaaEd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaIpmaaEd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAIPdAAed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAIPdAAed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAiPCAaeD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAiPCAaeD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaiPOaAEd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaiPOaAEd&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 2696 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 16mn 18s 920ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2388 Kbps\nAspect            : 704 x 528 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : gre\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6a15aa492a59ff0b51eaa9210824fa68c0e83c","amp;dn":"Looney+Looney+Looney+Bugs+Bunny+Movie+%281981%29+Greek+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6a15aa492a59ff0b51eaa9210824fa68c0e83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,106,21,170,73,42,89,255,11,81,234,169,33,8,36,250,104,192,232,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
