On a rain soaked deck, rolling through the darkness of the night sea, Beautifullyy Broken was the first song proffered and was followed by a dazzling Patchwork Quilt and Ballerina. Hearing the acoustic version of A Million Miles From Yesterday was truly a treat as was the set ending and apropos The Sky Is Crying. The second set got underway with a full head of steam as The Real Thing led into One and then a mesmerizing Tastes Like Wine with Karl Denson contributing his skills on the flute. Into The Mystic signalled the end of the acoustic guitar as he went electric for Going Down Slow and was then joined by Rob Barraco for To Lay Me Down and Soulshine to end the set. Returning to the stage for the encore, Grace Potter came along to end the night with a beautiful telling of Gold Dust Woman.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nDisc 1: \n1. Hello JamCruise \n2. Beautifully Broken\n3.
