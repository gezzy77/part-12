Its supporters saw themselves as a new elite, ideally placed to tackle the many challenges facing the young and rapidly industrializing German nation-state. They defined themselves as bourgeois, and acted as self-appointed champions of a modern consciousness. Focusing on figures such as Hermann Muthesius, Fritz Schumacher, and Karl-Ernst Osthaus, and the activities of the Deutscher Werkbund and other networks of bourgeois designers, writers, and 'experts', this book shows how bourgeois modernism shaped the infrastructure of social and political life in early twentieth-century Germany.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ce9579a731cc87d03b7c5070ba558011c15f28","amp;dn":"German+Cities+and+Bourgeois+Modernism+1890+-+1924+%28Art+Ebook%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ce9579a731cc87d03b7c5070ba558011c15f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,206,149,121,167,49,204,135,208,59,124,80,112,186,85,128,17,193,95,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
