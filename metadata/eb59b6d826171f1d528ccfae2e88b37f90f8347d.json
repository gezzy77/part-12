Spurned by the woman he loves, Chet sets off for new territory. The journey won't come cheap. Chet leads the Byrnes family across New Mexico into a harsh, haunting land. His long lost brother Cagle, after 15 years living among the Comanche, reappears. So does the family's blackest black sheep. Then, amidst old grudges and new battles, Chet picks up the trail of a killer he desperately wants to bring to justice. The reward is a hearty welcome to Arizona. The risk: dying before he can meet the one woman who'd make it all worthwhile.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb59b6d826171f1d528ccfae2e88b37f90f8347d","amp;dn":"Dusty+Richards-Between+Hell+and+Texas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb59b6d826171f1d528ccfae2e88b37f90f8347d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,89,182,216,38,23,31,29,82,140,207,174,46,136,179,127,144,248,52,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
