Read by Simon Callow\n\nAnimal Farm is George Orwell's great socio-political allegory set in a farmyard where the animals decide to seize the farmer's land and create a co-operative that reaps the benefits of their combined labours. However, as with all great political plans, some animals see a bigger share of the rewards than others and the animals start to question their supposed utopia.\n\n\n\n&gt;--- This Audiobook was converted and uploaded by OldScotsman ---&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc53e9751889374c8d2f642feb0b5fb8d41e52c","amp;dn":"George+Orwell+-+Animal+Farm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc53e9751889374c8d2f642feb0b5fb8d41e52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,197,62,151,81,136,147,116,200,210,246,66,254,176,181,251,141,65,229,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
