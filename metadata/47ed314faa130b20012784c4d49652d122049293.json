It gives essential information about usage, architectures, functioning, planning, construction, measurements and optimisation. The structure of the book is modular, giving both overall descriptions of the architectures and functionality of typical use cases, as well as deeper and practical guidelines for telecom professionals.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the book is on current and future networks, and the most up-to-date functionalities of each network are described in sufficient detail for deployment purposes. The contents include an introduction to each technology, its evolution path, feasibility and utilization, solution and network architecture, and technical functioning of the systems (signalling, coding, different modes for channel delivery and security of core and radio system). The planning of the core and radio networks (system-specific field test measurement guidelines, hands-on network planning advices and suggestions for the parameter adjustments) and future systems are also described.\r\n\r\nEach chapter covers aspects individually for easy reference, including approaches such as: functional blocks, protocol layers, hardware and software, planning, optimization, use cases, challenges, solutions to potential problems\r\nProvides very practical detail on the planning and operation of networks to enable readers to apply the content in real-world deployments\r\nBridges the gap between the communications in the academic context and the practical knowledge and skills needed to work in the telecommunications industry\r\nSection divisions include: General theory; Fixed telecommunications; Mobile communications; Space communications; Other and special communications; and Planning and management of telecommunication networks\r\nCovers new commercial and enhanced systems deployed, such as IPv6 based networks, LTE-Advanced and GALILEO\r\nAn essential reference for Technical personnel at telecom operators; equipment and terminal manufacturers; Engineers working for network operators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ed314faa130b20012784c4d49652d122049293","amp;dn":"The+Telecommunications+Handbook+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ed314faa130b20012784c4d49652d122049293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,237,49,79,170,19,11,32,1,39,132,196,212,150,82,209,34,4,146,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
