Coming six years after No Security, this seventh official Rolling Stones full-length live release captures performances from the band's year-long 2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003 Licks Tour in support of their career-spanning retrospective Forty Licks.\nOf the special guests taking part, Sheryl Crow appears on &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, while Solomon Burke sings on his own &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;, which The Rolling Stones originally covered on The Rolling Stones No. 2 in 1965.  The Rolling Stones released two subtly different versions of cover art for Live Licks. While both feature the Rolling Stones logo's tongue in a very suggestive context, the British version features the woman without her bikini top. Live Licks peaked at No. 38 in the UK and No. 50 in the US[citation needed], though it became a gold record on 9. December 2004 according to the RIAA.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Brown Sugar\n[02] Street Fighting Man\n[03] Paint It Black\n[04] You Can't Always Get What You Want\n[05] Start Me Up\n[06] It's Only Rock N' Roll\n[07] Angie\n[08] Honky Tonk Women\n[09] Happy\n[10] Gimme Shelter\n[11] (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n\nPlay Time - 00h:49m:13s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Neighbours\n[02] Monkey Man\n[03] Rocks Off\n[04] Can't You Hear Me Knocking\n[05] That's How Strong My Love Is\n[06] The Nearness Of You\n[07] Beast Of Burden\n[08] When The Whip Comes Down\n[09] Rock Me, Baby\n[10] You Don't Have To Mean It\n[11] Worried About You\n[12] Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n\nPlay Time - 00h:59m:55s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:49m:08s\nTotal File Size....................... 782mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
