Once again, Travis Meeks has outdone himself with accoustic guitars,\nEgyptian sounds, orchestra pieces, that were all created by him and only him. Meeks\nhas by far outdone any comparision to Morrison or Cornell. He has reached into the\ndepths of his soul to create a very well-planned album with lyrics that will move you to the point of tears. You can feel his raw emotion in tracks like Die Born, Dirty Road, and Once Again just to name a few.\n\nThis album is by no means an accoustical ballad mixture. Such songs as Words, Hang On To This, and Fighting With Clay illustrate that you can still jam with accoustical guitars and give the impression of an electric guitar sound.\n\nDancing With The Wind may confuse someone who is new to Days' sound. This song clearly illustrates the influence that such bands as Dead Can Dance had on Meeks. His orchestra pieces throughout this song are completely brilliant and leave the listener wanting more. --  By Jewelet K Schmidt\n\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Hang on to this                                      [04:12]\n02.Fighting with clay                                   [02:53]\n03.Days in our life                                     [03:43]\n04.Die born                                             [03:57]\n05.Best of life                                         [05:34]\n06.Dirty road                                           [04:43]\n07.Where are you                                        [03:34]\n08.Never drown                                          [05:06]\n09.Words                                                [03:42]\n10.Once again                                           [03:40]\n11.Giving in                                            [05:45]\n12.Dancing with the wind                                [10:10]\n________\n56:59 min\n89,10 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
