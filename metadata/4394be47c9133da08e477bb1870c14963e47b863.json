THE SANDBOX IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF IMPROVEMENT, AND IT ISN'T FINISHED. BUYING THE LONG DARK ON EARLY ACCESS SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THE GAME. FOR MORE INFORMATION, REFER TO THE EARLY ACCESS INFORMATION ABOVE.***\nWhat is The Long Dark?\nThe Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and everything Mother Nature can throw at you.\nCurrent Game Features\nThe Early Access version of The Long Dark features the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-narrative Survival Sandbox mode. \n\nNo hand holding! The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. \nMonitor your Calorie count, Hunger and Thirst, Fatigue, and Body Temperature. Maintain your overall Condition if you want to survive. Let yourself weaken and any small threat may take lead to your death. \nTwo sandbox regions provided more than 10 square kms of wilderness to explore (and with more regions coming!). Mystery Lake offers abundant hunting and exploration of points of interest like the Forestry Lookout, TrapperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Homestead, and an abandoned Hydro Dam. Coastal Highway is populated with small townsites, a fishing village, and various hunting cabins in the hills. Watch out for thin ice! \nDynamic weather, wildlife, and time of day, all with an impact on how you choose to survive. \nOver 100 gear items including clothing, tools like hatchets and rifles, first aid equipment, foodstuffs, light sources like lanterns and flares, and firestarting equipment. \nHunt Deer, Snare Rabbits, and watch for Crows as they can signify the presence of animal, or human, corpses that can be vital sources of Supplies. Wolves are territorial and will defend their territory, or stalk you if they catch your scent. If you let them get too close, you may find yourself in a desperate struggle to survive. \nHarvest Wood for fuel, maintain your Gear and Clothing, and keep your Knife, Hatchet, and Rifle in top shape as they will save your life! \nDeep First Aid system featuring many afflictions including: Sprains, Blood Loss, Infection Risk, Infection, Food Poisoning, and Dysentery. \nCraft Snares, First Aid items, Repair your Clothing and Tools, and Harvest raw materials from the environment, as you do your best to become self-sufficient. \nPermadeath! See how long you can survive, check your standing on the global Leaderboards, then head back in and push yourself to survive longer. \n...and much more!\nOngoing Development\nWith an average of 3-4 updates per month, The Long Dark is in a state of constant improvement. Major areas that will receive additional expansion in the coming months: Crafting, Wildlife, NPC Survivors, more Hunting-type activities, more Gear, Tools, and Supplies, more Regions (maps), Oculus Rift support, Controller support, International Versions, and eventually, a full Story mode featuring the voice talents of Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale, Elias Toufexis, and David Hayter. \n\nPlease note that the Early Access price provides immediate access to the Sandbox Mode, and includes the cost of Story Mode, which will be available at the game's full launch.\nThe Hinterland Team\nThe Long Dark is brought to you by Hinterland Studio, an independent game developer comprised of industry veterans with significant credits on many renowned series including Far Cry, Red Faction, Saints Row, God of War, Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, Company of Heroes, and many others. The Long Dark is the team's first attempt to create a unique and thought-provoking independent game that pushes the boundaries of the medium. \n\nWe appreciate your support of our efforts!\n\n\n\n\nCHANGELOG:\nTHE LONG DARK SANDBOX v.197 -- CHANGELIST\n\n* Fix issue with Wolf spawn region population control in Coastal Highway.\n\nTHE LONG DARK SANDBOX v.198 -- CHANGELIST\n\n* Reduced memory usage when transitioning between outdoor scenes (to address out of memory crash for some people running 32 bit Windows)\n* Blood trails persist longer so players can effectively track bleeding wildlife\n* Wildlife can now lose the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scent if wind changes or if player gets far enough away\n* Don't close the inventory interface after eating, drinking or using first aid items\n* Fixed issue with being able to use a partially crafted bedroll\n* Fixed issue with footstep audio not respecting the global sound volume setting\n* Fixed incorrect time of day lighting during time lapse activities such as crafting\n\nTHE LONG DARK SANDBOX v.199 -- CHANGELIST\n* fixed inspection mode issue introduced in v.198 \n\n\n\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1.
