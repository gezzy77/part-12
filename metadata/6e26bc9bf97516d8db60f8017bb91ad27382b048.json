He then takes a vocal on a sweet 'Trouble In Mind' and a spirited romp through 'My Babe'.\n\nJohnny Nicholas's 'Cold Chills' is a nice mid-tempo shuffle with some great guitar work, before the pace is taken down for the lengthy 'ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Why IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Cryin'', featuring Sugar Ray Norcia again, this time on lovely chromatic harmonica; before things rock again on the self-explanatory 'Bocce Boogie' - you can just imagine the packed dance floor and the beer flowing!\n\nThe rest of the set contains mainly blues standards - from Robert Nighthawk's 'Sweet Black Angel' to Big Joe Williams 'Baby Please Don't Go', and even a touch of jazz on 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore'. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frightening how good these musicians were thirty years ago and easy to see how they are still at the top of the blues tree.\n\nThe closing 'BreakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ With The Earl' is one of those jazzy shuffles that builds as it goes on and what Ronnie Earl became famous for, and is complete with band introductions before some of that trademark guitar work and nice piano from Anthony Giarossi, a lovely ending to a fine release that comes highly recommended.\n\nThe real deal, the blues the way it's supposed to be played, the way it's supposed to be enjoyed, in a setting that is, and has been, home to the blues throughout it's history, in the juke joints, lounges and bars.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e26bc9bf97516d8db60f8017bb91ad27382b048","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Big+Walter+Horton+-+Bocce+Boogie+%5BLive+1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e26bc9bf97516d8db60f8017bb91ad27382b048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,38,188,155,249,117,22,216,219,96,248,1,123,185,26,210,115,130,176,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
