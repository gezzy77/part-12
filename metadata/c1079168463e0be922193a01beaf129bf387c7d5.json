She loves animals and has lots of them--a cat, a parakeet, a dog, and a large black lizard. The other cats and birds in the neighborhood seem to like Maggie as well. And Maggie makes the most delicious fudge. In fact, her fudge is so good, after one piece it almost seems as if Tad and Nora's father are becoming animal lovers . . . and after several pieces, Nora can even have a conversation with the family dog, Skipper. But what happens when you eat one piece too many?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1079168463e0be922193a01beaf129bf387c7d5","amp;dn":"No+Such+Thing+as+a+Witch+-+Ruth+Chew.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1079168463e0be922193a01beaf129bf387c7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,7,145,104,70,62,11,233,34,25,58,1,190,175,18,155,243,135,199,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
