Simply put...HOLLYWOOD SAID NO!\n\nSince Mr. Show closed up shop, Bob and David have kept busy with many projects--acting in fun, successful, movies and TV shows, directing things, and complaining about stuff that didn't turn out well to anyone who would listen, and even alone, in silence, inside their own heads.\n\nHOLLYWOOD SAID NO! reveals the full-length, never-before-seen scripts for Bob and David Make a Movie (fleshed out with brand-new storyboards by acclaimed artist Mike Mitchell) and Hooray For America!: a satirical power-house indictment of all that you hold dear. This tome also includes a bonus section of orphaned sketch ideas from the Mr. Show days and beyond, suitable for performance by church groups that aren't all koo-koo about religion. What you are looking at online, and are about to buy, is chock-full of comic twists, turns, and maybe a few hard truths. We said &quot;maybe,&quot; but what we mean was &quot;probably not.&quot;\n\nNow, for the first time, take a peek at the scripts that didn't get the go-ahead and ponder a world we can only dream about...and beyond!\n\nOdenkirk and Cross, who created and starred in the HBO sketch-comedy series Mr. Show, offer up the scripts to their two unproduced features as well as several sketches. The first of the scripts, Bob and David Make a Movie, finds Odenkirk and Cross on a quixotic journey throughout Hollywood to get their movie green-lit. They brave fast-talking doctors, Korean movie bootleggers, and sleazy producers in their quest to fulfill the requirements laid out for them by the woman who holds the power to make their cinematic aspirations a reality. Before skewering Hollywood, Odenkirk and Cross penned Hooray for America, which finds David as an improbable candidate for president, backed by a sinister chemical company, while Bob, after being humiliated on national television, ends up working as the diabolical companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascot. Since Mr. Show, Cross and Odenkirk have gone on to play iconic characters in Arrested Development and Breaking Bad, respectively, and their fans will no doubt enjoy seeing them reunited on the page in these zany comedic endeavors. --Kristine Huntley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6cbc50737361f3f63a66fa30764b1947acba94","amp;dn":"Hollywood+Said+No%21+-+David+Cross+%26amp%3B+Bob+Odenkirk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6cbc50737361f3f63a66fa30764b1947acba94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,108,188,80,115,115,97,243,246,58,102,250,48,118,75,25,71,172,186,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
