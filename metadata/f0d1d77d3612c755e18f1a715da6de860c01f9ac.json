Still, as Sibelius reportedly told Englund, â€œYou shouldn't dismiss your work. The quintet is your best work to date, and you will always remember it as the first milestone in your career.â€œ\r\n\r\n&quot;Sibelius knew the disadvantages of being a late-starter, and one who took considerably longer to find his own voice. He wasn't just being compassionate in his remarks, however. Englund's part-writing in the quintet is idiomatic; his themes have character; the inner movements impress with their unity of concept and ability to achieve much through an economy of means. Though uneven in inspiration and overfilled with incident, the Piano Quintet is just as worthy of praise as Sibelius presciently indicated.&quot;\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosedYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or just looking in this regularly updated thread: \r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d1d77d3612c755e18f1a715da6de860c01f9ac","amp;dn":"Einar+Englund+-+P+Qnt+-+Sinfonia+Lahti+Ch+Ens%2C+P+Lonnqvist%2C+p+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d1d77d3612c755e18f1a715da6de860c01f9ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,209,215,125,54,18,199,85,225,143,26,113,93,166,222,134,12,1,249,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
