Taking the reader on a fast-moving journey from HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rough-and-tumble Baltimore childhood (where she ran errands at a whorehouse in exchange for the chance to listen to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith albums), to her emergence on HarlemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s club scene, to sold-out performances with the Count Basie Orchestra and with Artie Shaw and his band, this revelatory memoir is notable for its trenchant observations on the racism that darkened BillieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and the heroin addiction that ended it too soon. We are with her during the mesmerizing debut of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStrange FruitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; with her as she rubs shoulders with the biggest movie stars and musicians of the day (Bob Hope, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and more); and with her through the scrapes with Jim Crow, spats with Sarah Vaughan, ignominious jailings, and tragic decline. All of this is told in HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tart, streetwise style and hip patois that makes it read as if it were written yesterday.\n\nThe book was  re-released in late July. Expanding on the original, the publisher has added a foreword and a complete listing of Holiday's discography, both by writer David Ritz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d8a1f1eb60d9390a90af3601dbe7f577b95481","amp;dn":"Lady+Sings+The+Blues%28Billie+Holiday+auto+bio%29%28epub%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d8a1f1eb60d9390a90af3601dbe7f577b95481","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,216,161,241,235,96,217,57,10,144,175,54,1,219,231,245,119,185,84,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
