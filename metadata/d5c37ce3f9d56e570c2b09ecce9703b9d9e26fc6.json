Many of these are just a \n\nsquare with a pattern, which can be also used in other projects. \n\nThey are not rar-ed, so you can pick and choose which files you need. \nEverything was carefully renamed for consistency, so that the file name \n\nreflects the real title, and you can see whether you have it or not. \n\nTo choose the files you want to download when downloading a .torrent file, \n\nif you're using Firefox it will ask you &quot;save or open&quot;. Choose Open with \n\nuTorrent or your other client. And you'll get a window with all the files \n\nchecked. Uncheck the ones you don't want, click OK and you're done. \n\nTo choose the files you want to download when downloading a magnet link, \n\nin uTorrent) go to the lower half of the window, click the &quot;Files&quot; tab, wait a \n\nbit until the list of files appears; select those you don't want, right click and \n\ncheck &quot;Don't download&quot;. Other clients also have this capability. \n\nHowever, if you download the whole thing and seed it, you will do a service \n\nto other downloaders. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Site statistics are not always accurate - actually, they \n\nseldom are! For instance, you may see 0 seeders and just a few leechers, \n\nbut if you download and open in your torrent client, you may see that in fact \n\nthere are many. So don't trust the numbers you see and despair, check for \n\nyourself before giving up. \n\nYou may be interested in my other knitting and crochet torrents. Just click my username to see them all.
