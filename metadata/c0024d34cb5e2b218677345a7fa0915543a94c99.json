Meyer used running jokes and recurring themes in many of his films which were unique to the veteran's sense of humor. In Supervixens, these include the use of German marching tunes and Nazi references. Actor Henry Rowland appears as Martin Bormann, who was Adolf Hitler's personal secretary, rumored to have escaped Allied justice for decades and the subject of many &quot;sightings&quot;. The Bormann character refers to SuperAngel as the FÃƒÂ¼hrer.\nBruce Springsteen mentions this movie in the chorus of his song 'Pilgrim in the temple of love'.\n\nSet again in the vast Californian deserts and small towns that he loves, Russ Meyer's Supervixens represents a strong return to a confident, independent style after a few side tracks (two major studio releases and the disappointing Blacksnake). Blazing with color and audacious action, this film best presents the Meyer universe, a world where women are all-powerful beings in control of sex and society, and men merely bath toys being tossed in their wake. \n\nEvery female character's name sports a sassy &quot;Super&quot; as a prefix (Supereula, Superlorna, Supercherry), and their impressive proportions are emphasized through costume, camera angles, and the bold, aggressive nature of their actions. The male leads either run from these aggressive women or attempt to destroy them, choosing acceptance or defiance of what Meyer sees as a natural order. Supervixens is also the most graphic film that Meyer had made at that point.\n\nThere's less left to the imagination in terms of sex, nudity, and violence, Meyer obviously feeling the need to keep up commercially with an exploitation audience that he himself had helped stoke toward stronger stuff. It's easily his most violent work; the scene where sadistic cop Harry Sledge (Charles Napier) murders Superangel (Shari Eubank) is, for better or for worse, one of the most viciously rendered by any director, the impotent rage that Sledge unleashes terrifyingly real. Meyer wouldn't create anything this intense again, though the two films that followed are definitely along the same outrageously cartoonish lines. This is the finest, most consistently entertaining of the director's 1970s work.\n \nTaking its zany energy from slapstick comedy, Supervixens rushes breathlessly from one comic setup to the next, interspersing each scene with plenty of shots of pneumatic beauties stripping off and wiggling their ample assets. The tone is pure 'Looney Tunes': Harry kidnaps SuperVixen, tying her up in the desert with a stick of dynamite between her legs (&quot;the best bang you ever had&quot;) while making explicit references to the manic chases of the 'Road Runner' cartoons. There's even a &quot;That's all folks!&quot; ending, albeit with a nude woman standing in for Porky Pig. In retrospect this, together with the jokey, good ol' boy humour, could well have been an influence on 1977's Smokey And The Bandit franchise of chases and bosoms.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.09gb\nDuration.... 01:17:24\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate....1831kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 192kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0024d34cb5e2b218677345a7fa0915543a94c99","amp;dn":"Supervixens+1975+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0024d34cb5e2b218677345a7fa0915543a94c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,2,77,52,203,94,43,33,134,119,52,90,127,160,145,85,67,169,76,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
