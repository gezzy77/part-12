Their music, built around radiant harmonies and a solid electric folk foundation, was gorgeous on its own terms, but a major part of its appeal lay in the easygoing southern California lifestyle it endorsed. The group's success was as extraordinary as it was brief, and onlookers may well wonder what went wrong with a performing group that seemed to have the world at its feet for all of two years. The irony behind the Mamas &amp; the Papas' story is that the same forces that made it possible for them to create extraordinary music together also made it impossible for them to stay together for more than a short time.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mamas-the-papas-p4831/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mamas-the-papas-p4831/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by James Christopher Monger):\n\nThis Mamas &amp; the Papas compilation from the U.K.'s See for Miles reissue label collects five EPs from the folk-rock legends' heydays. For the most part, all of the big hits are here, including &quot;California Dreamin',&quot; &quot;Monday, Monday,&quot; &quot;Go Where You Wanna Go,&quot; &quot;I Saw Her Again,&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Street,&quot; but without &quot;Creeque Alley&quot; and &quot;Twelve-Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon),&quot; this 20-track EP Collection is far from definitive. Fans looking for the whole package should check out Geffen's two-disc Gold compilation or Universal/MCA's massive, four-disc Complete Anthology.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-r203778&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ep-collection-r203778&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011A3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011A3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
