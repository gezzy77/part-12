Therefore no charges or waiting time for data transfer are incurred.\n- The Europe version requires approx. 2GB of free memory. Please ensure you have sufficient available mass-storage space (SD card). The map material must be downloaded after installing the app via wireless Internet on the smartphone. Please ensure a reliable and safe connection is available.\n- On first startup a short data connection (ca. 25kB) is required to register your product\n\n\nWhether in the car, by bike or on foot, NAVIGON hopes you have fun navigating.\n\n\n-----------\nWhats New:\n\nNAVIGON EUROPE 4.7.0\n\n+\n\n Foursquare: Search for recommended locations from the Foursquare community and check in at your arrival\n+ Glympse: Send your current location during a pre-defined time to selected contacts via SMS or mail.
