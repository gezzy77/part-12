It includes EBM concepts for use in the identification of cost-effective panels of immunostains and other laboratory tests and for improvement of diagnostic accuracy based on the identification of selected diagnostic features for particular differential diagnosis. EBM concepts are also put forth for use in Meta-analysis to integrate the results of conflicting literature reports and use of novel analytical tools such as Bayesian belief networks, neural networks, multivariate statistics and decision tree analysis for the development of new diagnostic and prognostic models for the evaluation of patients. This volume will be of great value to pathologists who will benefit from the concepts being promoted by EBM, such as levels of evidence, use of Bayesian statistics to develop diagnostic and other rules and stronger reliance on &quot;hard data&quot; to support therapeutic and diagnostic modalities.\n\n\nHardcover: 375 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 1, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441910298\nISBN-13: 978-1441910295","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f7efa27fe88e8761cc6f685210764fe0c32daf","amp;dn":"Evidence+Based+Pathology+and+Laboratory++Medicine+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f7efa27fe88e8761cc6f685210764fe0c32daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,247,239,162,127,232,142,135,97,204,111,104,82,16,118,79,224,195,45,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
