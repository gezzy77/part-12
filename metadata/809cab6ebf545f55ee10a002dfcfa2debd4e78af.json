Throughout these lessons we will go over how to composite elements such as fire and smoke, and make them as real as possible. We will be using the powerful 3D system in NUKE to position these elements properly. We are going to create a whole new environment within our scene. We will then export our camera to Maya and set up our scene and effects. You will learn new techniques in this course, as well as the skills it takes to work faster as a compositor.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img30/1227/c8hn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img30/1227/c8hn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:809cab6ebf545f55ee10a002dfcfa2debd4e78af","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+%26ndash%3B+Destruction+Compositing+Techniques+in+NUK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"809cab6ebf545f55ee10a002dfcfa2debd4e78af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,156,171,110,191,84,95,85,238,16,160,2,223,207,162,222,189,78,120,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
