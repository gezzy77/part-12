Ja-hyo (Kim Rae-weon) is a student in his last year at high school who attracts the eye of a girl named Ha-ra (Yun Ji-hye). Ha-ra throws herself at Ja-hyo, but he is unable to return her love after they&amp;#039;ve slept together. Ha-ra falls into a deep depression and commits suicide; shocked and saddened, Ja-hyo finds himself unable to commit to a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. He becomes involved with Nam-ok (Bae Du-na), an older woman working as a nurse, but while Ja-hyo isn&amp;#039;t sure if he&amp;#039;s ready for a long-term relationship, Man-ok isn&amp;#039;t about to let him get away from her. Meanwhile, Ja-hyo&amp;#039;s best friend Su-in (Kim Jeong-hyeon) has romantic problems of his own -- he&amp;#039;s fallen in love with his teacher, Jeong-hye (Jin Heui-kyeong). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5233d276d8eaeb4eea166c0c22dad9be77ed5b0","amp;dn":"Plum.Blossom.2000.+Korean+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5233d276d8eaeb4eea166c0c22dad9be77ed5b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,35,61,39,109,142,174,180,238,161,102,192,194,45,173,155,231,126,213,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
