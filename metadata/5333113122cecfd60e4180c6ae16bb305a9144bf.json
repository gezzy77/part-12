The story begins as the two begin scouting locations in Italy for Tarkovsky&amp;#039;s film, Nostalgia. Though Guerra shows him many beautiful places, Tarkovsky rejects them all until they go to the medieval town, Bagno Vignoi, which contains in its main square, a famous Roman bath. The two then begin to converse about filmmaking and life with Guerra asking questions in Italian and Tarkovsky answering them in Russian.\nSandra Brennan\n\nA voice from IMDB\n\nI have been looking EVERYWHERE for this documentary! it must be the most coveted biographical doc ever, i live in new york and anyone who knows what its like to live there knows that finding even the oldest, most obscure works is always possible, however, i could never get my hands on it. i have seen all of his films, read his book and his interviews, consider him a god of sorts, have never had a chance to see how he was in person, his mannerisms, his voice, his expressions, his tone.. I finally found this in some small Illinois town and picked it up immediately and watched it. So fulfilling! It was made while he was in Italy scouting locations for &amp;#039;Nostalghia&amp;#039; with screenwriter Toni Guerro. He speaks candidly and vulnerably about his past films, art, and fields questions from young filmmakers. Important document (and a beautiful film too!) and testament to one of the greatest geniuses that ever lived. Try and find it.\n\nFile Name .............: voyage.in.time.1983.dvdrip.xvid-imbt.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 367,497,216 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 1:02:20 (19793528 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD 1.0.3\nFrame Size ............: 448x336 [=1.333]\nFPS ...................: 24.975\nVideo Bitrate .........: 694 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.185 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 89 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n \nNOT MY RIP   Thanks to imbt for the rip \n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
