So argues David Horowitz, bestselling author in his newest book Radicals: Portraits of a Destructive Passion.\nFrom Karl Marx to Barack Obama, Horowitz shows how the idealistic impulse to make the world Ã¢â‚¬Å“a better placeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gives birth to the twin cultural pathologies of cynicism and nihilism, and is the chief source of human suffering. A former liberal himself, Horowitz recounts his own brushes with radicalism and offers unparalleled insight into the disjointed ideology of liberal elites through case studies of well-known radial leftists, including Christopher Hitchens, feminist Bettina Aptheker , leftist academic Cornel West, and more.\nExploring the origin and evolution of radical liberals and their progressive ideology, Radicals illustrates how liberalism is not only intellectually crippling for its adherents, but devastating to society.\nGenre: Non-Fiction | General | True Crime\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e38f22e9181d127c473c04ea5a47480f77a514d5","amp;dn":"Radicals%3A+Portraits+of+a+Destructive+Passion+by+David+Horowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e38f22e9181d127c473c04ea5a47480f77a514d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,143,34,233,24,29,18,124,71,60,4,234,90,71,72,15,119,165,20,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
