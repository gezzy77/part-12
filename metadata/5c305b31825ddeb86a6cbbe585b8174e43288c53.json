The lyrics are mostly about white supremacy, hate and anti-religion. BlackGoat rejects the Ã¢â‚¬Å“NSBMÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ label because, although racialist in his lyrics and perspectives, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t particularly identify his lyrics with the National Socialist movement.\n\nGoatmoon was created in spring 2002 from the ruins of BlackGoatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old band Count LÃƒÂ¤hde(-99). First recordings BlackGoat made by him self, but in some point of summer Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ02 joined drummer T. Bloodvengeance, who played on the half of songs on the first demo. On the early winter of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ02 Bloodvengeance left the Goatmoon. BlackGoat has recorded six demos by himself during the years 02-05. First full length album was brought to moonlight late winter Ã¢â‚¬â„¢04 released and distributed by Werewolf records.\n\n\nGoatmoon At MySpace\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Voitto Tai Valhalla\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
