Guy Delisle delves deep into the male psyche and emerges with 26 alphabetically arranged strips, named after the men who tumble through the pages. These elastic protagonists risk damnation and dismemberment in a series of improbable slapstick relationships with women that veer from the titillating to the downright macabre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba822ed2a3fc99c8ebf2b20c3491a66d8cf8ee93","amp;dn":"Guy+Delisle+-+Albert+and+the+Others","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba822ed2a3fc99c8ebf2b20c3491a66d8cf8ee93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,130,46,210,163,252,153,200,235,242,178,12,52,145,166,109,140,248,238,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
