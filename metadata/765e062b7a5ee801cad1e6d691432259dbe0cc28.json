Often the target is the individual's spouse. The program is edited in a documentary style, using a central voice-over narration by reporter Sharon Martin, as well as interviews with people in possession of first-hand knowledge of the case, including law-enforcement officials, lawyers, journalists, friends and family members of both the victims and the accused, and at times the criminals themselves.\n\n1.Donna Yaklich\n2.Yesenia Patino\n3.Manuela Garcia\n4.
