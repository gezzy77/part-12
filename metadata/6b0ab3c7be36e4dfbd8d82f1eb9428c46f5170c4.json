Playing as dual characters, Jack Forzenski and Marcus Hill, gamers must rid the world of the powerful international drug cartel known as K.R.A.K. But to do so, users will have to use their deadly firepower and police authority to make the choice of either playing it straight or stumble down the road of narcotics. Pursue illegal deals with drug dealers or be the law abiding NARC cop. It's up to you. \n\n\nWho's up for pummeling whores and stealing their drugs?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0ab3c7be36e4dfbd8d82f1eb9428c46f5170c4","amp;dn":"NARC+PC%282005%29+RePack.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0ab3c7be36e4dfbd8d82f1eb9428c46f5170c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,10,179,199,190,54,228,223,189,141,130,241,235,148,40,196,111,81,112,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
