Executive-produced by Watley herself, the album highlighted her MCA years (1987-1994), and contained all of her well-known pop hits, among them &quot;Looking For a New Love&quot;, &quot;Real Love&quot; and &quot;Everything&quot;; two of Watley's classics, &quot; &quot;Don't You Want Me&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Lover&quot;, were presented in their more familiar remixed forms. Additionally, Watley (who compiled the collection with Andy McKaie) took care to include lesser-known (but equally iconic) songs like &quot;Still a Thrill&quot; and &quot;Most of All&quot;.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Looking For A New Love\n[02] I Want You\n[03] Some Kind Of Lover \t\t\t- (Dance Remix)\n[04] Friends\n[05] Still A Thrill\n[06] Everything\n[07] Don't You Want Me \t\t\t- (Dance Remix)\n[08] Your Love Keeps Working On Me\n[09] Most Of All\n[10] I'm The One You Need\n[11] Ecstasy \t\t\t\t\t- (Extended Dance Remix)\n[12] When A Man Loves A Woman\t\t- (P.M.
