The series is set in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nJamie's challenge is to see if he can get a whole community cooking again. He works with the school lunch ladies and local families to get everyone back in the kitchen and making tasty meals with fresh ingredients ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no packets, no cheating. He's started a Food Revolution: to get people all over America to reconnect with their food and change the way they eat.\n\n\nRelease Date----- 26.03.2010\nRelease Size----- 350.13 Mb\nPlay Time-------- 00:42:10\nVideo------------ 624x352\nFrame Rate------- 23.976fps\nVideo Codec------ XVID\nAudio ----------- MPEG Audio \nAudio Codec------ MP3\n\n\nIPOLITAN - T h e  n e w   w o r l d   o f   k n o w l e d g e\n\nipolitan.wordpress com\n\n\nSeed and enjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98427498392301bd1ca247490ed351b567369994","amp;dn":"Jamie+Olivers+Food+Revolution+S01E01+HDTV+XviD-Ipolitan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98427498392301bd1ca247490ed351b567369994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,66,116,152,57,35,1,189,28,162,71,73,14,211,81,181,103,54,153,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
