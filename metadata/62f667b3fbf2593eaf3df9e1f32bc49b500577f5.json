After lifting a cool million from a U.S. bank, the crook is anxious to sneak across the border into Mexico, but to do so he must hire an experienced wilderness guide. He goes to the guide's ranch and finds his ex-lover, now the guide's wife, preparing to leave her husband. The crook offers to take her to her home town. There is trouble with a border guard and the crook runs him over with his car. Terrified, the girl tries to escape, but the crook runs after her and they go back to the ranch where they meet the guide (who was beside the border guard when he died). Desperately, the crook forces the guide and his wife to head into the mountains with him. As they traverse the treacherous terrain, the crook becomes increasingly desperate and makes it plain that he will kill anyone who stands in his way. He also makes it clear that he would rather die himself than give up the money. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050903/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050903/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-50903/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-50903/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:16\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 712x320  2.22:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1644 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,30 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f667b3fbf2593eaf3df9e1f32bc49b500577f5","amp;dn":"The+River%5C%27s+Edge+%281957%29+Anthony+Quinn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f667b3fbf2593eaf3df9e1f32bc49b500577f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,246,103,179,251,242,89,62,175,61,249,225,243,43,196,155,80,5,119,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
