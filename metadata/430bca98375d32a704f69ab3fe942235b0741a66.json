Viewing this made me feel like I was on the front row! And the most amazing thing (besides the music) is that sells for just 10 bucks! Absolutely the wisest 10 bucks I've ever spent! I give it 15 stars!\n\nSome may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert. G-3 LIVE IN CONCERT is a 3 song live playing of each artist and then they all jam together at the end in complete rapport and friendship. You can tell they all respect each other alot. The running time is 75 minutes of &quot;glued to your seat&quot; entertainment! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!\n\nHere are the songs in order: SATRIANI plays 1) Cool No9 2) Flying In A Blue Dream and 3) Summer Sky. The second is my favorite. JOHNSON plays second. His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite. VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song. Again the second song is my favorite.\n\n&quot;THE JAM SONGS&quot; (FEATURING ALL 3 G-3'S) are: 1) Going Down 2) My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama and 3) Red House (in honor of the late, great Jimi Hendrix.) The third song is my favorite.\n\nI highly and whole-heartedly recommend this videotape--incredible sound, very entertaining, diverse, and fun to view. You will not be disappointed; trust me! BUY THIS NOW! DON'T MISS IT! There isn't a single boring moment or bad song; these guys ROCK! It will make you a fan of all three if you aren't already! \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0218/8f/07f56ec9d87f927b795f62566d44c88f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0218/8f/07f56ec9d87f927b795f62566d44c88f.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n0=============================0\n\n.: Info Ripping :.\n\nDimensione........: 664 MB\nDurata............: 01:08:32\n\nVideo Codec.......: DivX 3 Low-Motion\nVideo Bitrate.....: 1155 kb/s\nRisoluzione.......: 480x336 (1.43:1) [=10:7]\nFPS (Frames/sec)..: 29.970\nQF (Frame quality): 0.239 bits/pixel\n\nAudio Codec.......: MP3\nAudio Bitrate.....: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR\nFreq Audio........: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:430bca98375d32a704f69ab3fe942235b0741a66","amp;dn":"G3+-+Live+in+Concert+1996+%5BDVDrip+Eng%5D+E.Johnson+S.Vai+J.Satrian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"430bca98375d32a704f69ab3fe942235b0741a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,11,202,152,55,93,50,167,4,246,154,179,254,148,34,53,176,116,26,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
