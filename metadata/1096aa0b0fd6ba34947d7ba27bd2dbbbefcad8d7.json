It is the only book written for health care professionals who work with adolescents in schools, community agencies, neighborhoods, and other settings. It contains abundant resources for best serving-and having a positive impact on-this population. Designed to provide speedy information retrieval, the guide describes a broad spectrum of health and health care issues particular to adolescents, reviews current data, explores behaviors and risk factors, and addresses nursing implications for treatment. Framed in a positive perspective of adolescence, the book also includes suggestions for working and communicating effectively with teens.\n\nChapters are consistently organized according to the domain model, a whole-person health model comprising six pillars: physical, intellectual, sexual, spiritual, emotional, and relational. Special features include brief chapters with bullet points; an introduction, clear objectives, and summary in each chapter; Fast Facts in a Nutshell; lists and tables summarizing important information; and references including key resources. The book also includes a special section on chronic illness and complex health issues in teens and covers problems arising from technology use, legal and ethical issues, and marginalization of youth. This is a compact, affordable resource for students and health professionals &quot;on the front lines&quot; alike.\n\nKey Features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Identifies and addresses the key aspects of working with adolescents in an accessible, portable, and user-friendly format\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Written by a highly respected leader in adolescent nursing\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Presents a broad spectrum of adolescent health issues in many settings\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Incorporates current issues related to adolescent health and risk behaviors throughout\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes information on communicating and intervening with teens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1096aa0b0fd6ba34947d7ba27bd2dbbbefcad8d7","amp;dn":"Fast+Facts+on+Adolescent+Health+for+Nursing+and+Health+Professio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1096aa0b0fd6ba34947d7ba27bd2dbbbefcad8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,150,170,11,15,214,186,52,148,125,123,162,123,210,219,187,239,202,216,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
