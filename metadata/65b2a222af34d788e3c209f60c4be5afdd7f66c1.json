This is one of the best dance albums of that decade, but it is much more than just another dance album.\nDuring the four years that went into this album's production, Dennis worked with D Mob to record the song C'mon and Get My Love, and this served as the introduction of her voice to the public. Some have called this song a dance anthem, and there can be no doubt that it gets the body moving with its intense energy and unflagging beat. \nMore great dance songs were to come, significant hits in the form of Just Another Dream, All Night Long (Touch Me), and Move to This. Dancin' Danny D of D Mob backs Dennis up on Just Another Dream (although he sounds a little too much like Rick Astley here for my comfort); this is the song that made me a fan, although Dennis' most memorable hit is probably All Night Long (Touch Me). The dance songs that didn't see release are really just as good as any on the album: Everybody Move bursts with energy, Got to Get Your Love takes a backseat to no track, and Taste Your Love finishes the album off with great pep and emotion.\nSome critics were never won over by Cathy Dennis' voice, but I cannot agree with their oftentimes negative assessment of the few stray ballads on this CD. Too Many Walls paints a poignant picture of a love that could have been, and its run up the singles charts was none too shabby. My Beating Heart makes for a second ballad that does much to disprove Dennis' lack of range. You won't find any poetic musings to philosophize over in these lyrics, but Dennis' soulful delivery is a far cry indeed from throwaway pop. The only weak track on the CD, as far as I am concerned, is Tell Me - this song basically just lies there giving few signs of life. The other nine tracks more than make up for this one lackluster effort, however.\nCathy Dennis remains a force in music today, writing such hits as Can't Get You Out of My Head for Kylie Minogue. While her solo career faded in the mid-1990s, Move to This stands as a lasting testament to her talent. She co-wrote nine of the album's ten songs, was heavily involved in the mixing and production of the album, and created something that holds up remarkably well all these years later.
