They will embark on a 12 day epic mission like no other. Only the courageous will survive this brutal expedition to the very end. They must trek over treacherous mountains, find and eat wild food, build shelter and make fire as they navigate their way to the coastline and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Part 6 \r\nThe Finalists fight it out to be crowned ultimate mission survivor. The first task sees the trio traversing a rocky coastline and performing a commando crawl 80ft above crashing waves. They no longer have any rations, so they must then forage for seafood in the shallows and rockpools, before joining Bear, Meg and Scott around the campfire to reflect on the competition. The next morning, Bear has a couple of surprises to see how they react to adversity, and then they face their last two challenges - making fire, a primary skill for a survivor, and racing to the top of a 65ft sheer cliff face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3138 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/mission-survive/251813-mission-survive-2016-cast-revealed-meet-celebrity-contestants.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:622474d1893c9069af30bd941911219d309fa047","amp;dn":"Bear+Grylls+Mission+Survive+Series+2+6of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"622474d1893c9069af30bd941911219d309fa047","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,36,116,209,137,60,144,105,175,48,189,148,25,17,33,157,48,159,160,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
