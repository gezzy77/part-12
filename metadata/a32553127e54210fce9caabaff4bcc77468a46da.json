With appearances on Em&amp;#039;s 8 MILE soundtrack and a debut album, CHEERS, in the can, Trice reaches for the brass ring on the follow-up, SECOND ROUND&amp;#039;S ON ME. And he gets off to a brilliant start with leadoff single &quot;Since They Wanna Know.&quot; Built out of the powerhouse hometown hard-rock of Power of Zeus&amp;#039;s 1970 hitter &quot;It Couldn&amp;#039;t Be Me,&quot; the track became the unofficial theme song of the third season of HBO&amp;#039;s series ENTOURAGE, and was subsequently heard by millions. Leaning heavily on a mid-paced, paranoid gangsta-rap production style, evidenced on tracks like &quot;They Wanna Kill Me&quot; and &quot;Snitch&quot; (a duet with Akon), Trice stakes his claim as a tough, swaggering performer whose self-awareness never undermines his hard, ghetto edge.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32553127e54210fce9caabaff4bcc77468a46da","amp;dn":"Obie+Trice+-+Second+Round%5C%27s+On+Me+%28Retail%29+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32553127e54210fce9caabaff4bcc77468a46da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,37,83,18,126,84,33,15,206,156,170,186,255,75,204,119,70,138,70,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
