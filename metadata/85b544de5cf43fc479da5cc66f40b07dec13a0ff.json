While not as nice as having the complete set of outtakes of each venue package\ntogether, still; for a compilation type of package (think of the official Bootleg series 1-3) This series is hard\nto match. It holds 3 CDs in separate cardboard sleeves. All packed in a glossy cardboard photo box. Included is a\nbooklet that lists tracks along with the venues, dates, and wonderful vintage photos. A true labor of love package.\n\n---\n\n\nBob Dylan\nGenuine Bootleg Series\nVolume 2\n\nFor more info: http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-g09.html\n\nDisc 1:\n\nd1t01 The Two Sisters\nd1t02 Lang A-Growing\nd1t03 Corrina, Corrina\nd1t04 That's Alright Mama\nd1t05 Hero Blues\nd1t06 Long Time Gone\nd1t07 Lay Down Your Weary Tune\nd1t08 Guess I'm Doing Fine\nd1t09 Mr. Tambourine Man I\nd1t10 Mr. Tambourine Man II\nd1t11 It's All Over Now Baby Blue\nd1t12 Lunatic Princess Revisited\nd1t13 I Don't Want To Be Your Partner\nd1t14 Freeze Out\nd1t15 Does She Need Me I &amp; II\nd1t16 Like A Rolling Stone\n\nDisc 2:\n\nd2t01 I'm Not There\nd2t02 Lang A-Growing\nd2t03 Banks Of The Royal Canal\nd2t04 Silent Weekend\nd2t05 Wild Mountain Thyme\nd2t06 Tomorrow Is A Long Time\nd2t07 Spanish Is The Loving Tongue\nd2t08 George Jackson\nd2t09 Goodbye Holly\nd2t10 House Of The Rising Sun\nd2t11 Nobody 'Cept You\nd2t12 Tangled Up In Blue\nd2t13 Abandoned Love\nd2t14 People Get Ready\nd2t15 The Water Is Wide\nd2t16 Repossession Blues\nd2t17 If You See Her Say Hello\nd2t18 Stop Now\nd2t19 Coming From The Heart\n\nDisc 3:\n\nd3t01 Ain't Gonna Go To Hell\nd3t02 Coverdown, Breakthrough\nd3t03 The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\nd3t04 Magic\nd3t05 Heart Of Mine\nd3t06 Nadine\nd3t07 We Three\nd3t08 The Dawn Is Gonna Shine (Almost Done I)\nd3t09 Almost Done II\nd3t10 Freedom For The Stallion\nd3t11 Something's Burning Baby\nd3t12 To Fall In Love With You\nd3t13 Got Love If You Want It\nd3t14 Don't Keep Me Waiting Too Long\nd3t15 Broken Days\nd3t16 Born In Time\nd3t17 Most Of The Time\nd3t18 Series Of Dreams\n\nReview from bobsboots.com:\nThis incredible 3 CD set is packed full of only the rarest tracks.

Each sleeve has a rare, glossy photo. Includes yet a different 40 page\nbooklet containing 24 more rare, vintage photos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b544de5cf43fc479da5cc66f40b07dec13a0ff","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+The+Genuine+Bootleg+Series+Vol.+1+-+3+%289+CDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b544de5cf43fc479da5cc66f40b07dec13a0ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,181,68,222,92,244,63,196,121,218,92,198,111,64,176,125,236,19,160,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
