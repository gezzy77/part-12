It even obtains new results when only approximate and partial solutions were previously available.\nThrough the problem of option pricing, the author introduces powerful tools and methods, including differential geometry, spectral decomposition, and supersymmetry, and applies these methods to practical problems in finance. He mainly focuses on the calibration and dynamics of implied volatility, which is commonly called smile. The book covers the BlackÃ¢â‚¬â€œScholes, local volatility, and stochastic volatility models, along with the Kolmogorov, SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger, and BellmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œHamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â€œJacobi equations.\nProviding both theoretical and numerical results throughout, this book offers new ways of solving financial problems using techniques found in physics and mathematics.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nA Brief Course in Financial Mathematics\nDerivative products\nBack to basics\nStochastic processes\nItÃƒÂ´ process\nMarket models\nPricing and no-arbitrage\nFeynmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œKacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorem\nChange of numÃƒÂ©raire\nHedging portfolio\nBuilding market models in practice\nSmile Dynamics and Pricing of Exotic Options\nImplied volatility\nStatic replication and pricing of European option\nForward starting options and dynamics of the implied volatility\nInterest rate instruments\nDifferential Geometry and Heat Kernel Expansion\nMultidimensional Kolmogorov equation\nNotions in differential geometry\nHeat kernel on a Riemannian manifold\nAbelian connection and StratonovichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s calculus\nGauge transformation\nHeat kernel expansion\nHypo-elliptic operator and HÃƒÂ¶rmanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorem\nLocal Volatility Models and Geometry of Real Curves\nSeparable local volatility model\nLocal volatility model\nImplied volatility from local volatility\nStochastic Volatility Models and Geometry of Complex Curves\nStochastic volatility models and Riemann surfaces\nPut-Call duality\nÃŽÂ»-SABR model and hyperbolic geometry\nAnalytical solution for the normal and log-normal SABR model\nHeston model: a toy black hole\nMulti-Asset European Option and Flat Geometry\nLocal volatility models and flat geometry\nBasket option\nCollaterized commodity obligation\nStochastic Volatility Libor Market Models and Hyperbolic Geometry\nIntroduction\nLibor market models\nMarkovian realization and Frobenius theorem\nA generic SABR-LMM model\nAsymptotic swaption smile\nExtensions\nSolvable Local and Stochastic Volatility Models\nIntroduction\nReduction method\nCrash course in functional analysis\n1D time-homogeneous diffusion models\nGauge-free stochastic volatility models\nLaplacian heat kernel and SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equations\nSchrÃƒÂ¶dinger Semigroups Estimates and Implied Volatility Wings\nIntroduction\nWings asymptotics\nLocal volatility model and SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation\nGaussian estimates of SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger semigroups\nImplied volatility at extreme strikes\nGauge-free stochastic volatility models\nAnalysis on Wiener Space with Applications\nIntroduction\nFunctional integration\nFunctional-Malliavin derivative\nSkorohod integral and Wick product\nFock space and Wiener chaos expansion\nApplications\nPortfolio Optimization and BellmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œHamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â€œJacobi Equation\nIntroduction\nHedging in an incomplete market\nThe feedback effect of hedging on price\nNonlinear BlackÃ¢â‚¬â€œScholes PDE\nOptimized portfolio of a large trader\nAppendix A: Saddle-Point Method\nAppendix B: Monte Carlo Methods and Hopf Algebra\nReferences\nIndex\nProblems appear at the end of each chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751025c7a9ad1344f2f87710a0c5138b0b9e9f4d","amp;dn":"Analysis%2C+Geometry%2C+and+Modeling+in+Finance%3A+Advanced+Methods+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751025c7a9ad1344f2f87710a0c5138b0b9e9f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,16,37,199,169,173,19,68,242,248,119,16,160,197,19,139,11,158,159,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
