Losing that bet put her in lockdown--and at the top of Todd Mitchell's revenge-fueled hit list. Now she'll work every seductive move and lethal play to survive.

Caked Up De'nesha Diamond Harlem Banks already has twenty-five million reasons to break out of the federal pen. But saving his desperately ill daughter is at the top of his list, even as he's racing his ex-partner-in crime to his stashed loot . . . while U.S. Marshals are hot on his trail.
