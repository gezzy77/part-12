The film tells how even as chattel slavery came to an end in the South after the Civil War, new systems of involuntary servitude took its place with shocking force and brutality. The film documents how for more than 80 years, thousands of African Americans, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of white masters. Tolerated by both the North and South, forced labor lasted well into the 20th century.\n\n[i]Slavery by Another Name[/i], based upon the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Douglas A. Blackmon, gives voice to the largely forgotten victims and perpetrators of forced labor and features moving interviews with their descendants living today. A distinguished group of historians provides context and perspective on one of the most shameful and little known chapters in American history. \n\nOriginal broadcast date: February 13, 2012\n\n[url]http://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/[/url]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Screenshots[/b]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[img]http://www.imgcrave.com/u/tTNe8.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.imgcrave.com/u/Jr03S.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.imgcrave.com/u/7qePF.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.imgcrave.com/u/LSc3e.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSlavery.by.Another.Name.HDTV.XviD-QCF.avi\n\nEnglish | 01:24:35 | XviD | 624Ãƒâ€”352 | 23.98fps 1160 Kbps | MP3 128 Kbps 48.0khz | 701MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f02f37eb1ba3184add059303cebed707f8426f","amp;dn":"PBS+Slavery+by+Another+Name+%282012.HDTV.XviD-QCF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f02f37eb1ba3184add059303cebed707f8426f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,240,47,55,235,27,163,24,74,221,5,147,3,206,190,215,7,248,66,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
