Utilizing years of advising companies of all sizes, hypergrowth startups to Fortune 500 company management teams, Dana Ardi identifies a pivotal evolutionary moment: the decline of the traditional Alpha-model (the top-down, male-dominated, authoritarian, corner-office hierarchy that has ruled organizational landscapes for so long), as it is replaced by collaboration, connectivity, and the sharing of power. As Ardi persuasively demonstrates, in the new Beta organization, it is the team players, the sage advisors, the network experts, the trusted assistants, and the communications facilitators who are coming to the fore, as savvy managers learn to lead through influence and collaboration rather than authority and competition. From technology behemoths to small and medium-sized businesses, Beta has become the new paradigm for success in today's challenging market.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66009be88261499d54f839be34af47a5ff72bbf","amp;dn":"The+Fall+of+the+Alphas%3A+The+New+Beta+Way+to+Connect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66009be88261499d54f839be34af47a5ff72bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,96,9,190,136,38,20,153,213,79,131,155,227,74,244,122,95,247,43,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
