But there are times when the televised concertsÃ¢â‚¬â€which have featured everyone from Nirvana to Bob Dylan over the past eight yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€do considerably more than just present songs in a newly marketable way. Such is the case with Kenny &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds' first in-performance album. Recorded in New York City this fall, Babyface Unplugged is, despite the title, a decidedly plugged-in event with such electrified backup players as Sheila E. and Nathan East plus guest stars Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder. But what is more significant than the higher-than-expected decibel level is the fact that Babyface Unplugged gives the ubiquitous singer-songwriter-producer a chance to reclaim some of the songs he gave awayÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop),&quot; &quot;Breathe Again&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and to offer up crisp new takes on his own personal hits. With the performer's impassioned singing, engaging ÃƒÂ©lan and impressive musicianship, this CD is a sleek, polished celebration of Kenny Edmonds, the hitmaker and the star. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f5653741cc8d6ecebe214d8ce737ba36b0ff3e4","amp;dn":"Babyface+-+MTV+Unplugged+NYC+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f5653741cc8d6ecebe214d8ce737ba36b0ff3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,86,83,116,28,200,214,236,235,226,20,216,206,115,123,163,107,15,243,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
