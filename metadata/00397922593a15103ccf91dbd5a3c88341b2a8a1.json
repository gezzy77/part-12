Or rather, Mario did, which pissed the hell out of Luigi. What would happen if you actually got to play Super Mario with a portal gun? Is that even possible, and would it be fun? The Portal II video game has become a huge hit, and it seems like everyone is playing it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a puzzle solving first person game in which you will cause no casualties more than a few broken computers and some chips. Whatever it is that makes people, by the millions, buy this game and play it is of course difficult to say more than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really cool.\n\nWhat would happen when you mash it up with Super MarioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ for real? I mean, the REAL gameplay would be awesome, right? Can you imagine in your head what it would be like having a portal gun at your disposal? If you have played Portal I or II, you know exactly what it would be like. If you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, we could have a problem. Good thing I found a clip on YouTube that totally shows you what it would be all about.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn4.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mario-portal.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn4.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mario-portal.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cromeyellow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/super-mario-portal2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cromeyellow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/super-mario-portal2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/03/05/243506-nintendo-s-super-mario-bros-will-now-have-valve-s-portal-guns.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/03/05/243506-nintendo-s-super-mario-bros-will-now-have-valve-s-portal-guns.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cromeyellow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/super-mario-portal2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cromeyellow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/super-mario-portal2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.bitrebels.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Super-Mario-Portal-Gun-Gameplay-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.bitrebels.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Super-Mario-Portal-Gun-Gameplay-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00397922593a15103ccf91dbd5a3c88341b2a8a1","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Portal+2012+-+Windows+Version+1.6+-+FULL+-+Foxy+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00397922593a15103ccf91dbd5a3c88341b2a8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,57,121,34,89,58,21,16,60,207,145,219,213,163,200,131,65,178,168,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
