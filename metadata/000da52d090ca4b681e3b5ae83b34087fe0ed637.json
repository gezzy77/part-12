KahleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s textbook has\nproved its worth. What should one do after taking on the job of carrying on with this text\nbook, other than leaving as much as possible as it is? However, the rapid growth in our\nknowledge of neuroscience does not permit this. In just the last few years many new discoveries\nhave been made that have shaped thewaywe viewthe structure and function of the\nnervous system. There was a need for updating and supplementing this knowledge. Hence,\nnewsections have been added; for example, a section on modern methods of neuroanatomy,\na section on neurotransmitter receptors, and an introduction to modern imaging procedures\nfrequently used in the hospital. The Clinical Notes have been preserved and supplemented in\norder to provide a link to the clinical setting. The purposewas to provide the student not only\nwith a solid knowledge of neuroanatomy but also with an important foundation of interdisciplinary\nneurocience. Furthermore, the student is introduced to the clinical aspects of those\nfields in which neuroanatomy plays an important role. I sincerely hope that the use of modern\nmulticolor printing has made it possible to present things more clearly and in a more uniform\nway. Thus, sensory pathways are now always presented in blue.\n\n\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a3ced6cbc2cecec2c78dd4c2d2c2d18dc2c1c1c2d0e3cfcad5c68dc0ccce&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000da52d090ca4b681e3b5ae83b34087fe0ed637","amp;dn":"Color+Atlas++and+TextbookOf+Human+Anatomy+Vol+3+5th+Ed.+%5BWerner_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000da52d090ca4b681e3b5ae83b34087fe0ed637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,13,165,45,9,12,164,182,129,227,181,174,131,179,64,135,254,14,214,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
