Covering all the key concepts of his work, Starting with Wittgenstein provides an accessible introduction to the ideas of this hugely significant thinker. Thematically structured, the book leads the reader through a thorough overview of the development of Wittgenstein's thought, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the roots of his philosophical concerns. Offering coverage of the full range of Wittgenstein's earlier and later work, the book emphasizes the relationship between his treatment of language and his treatment of the other major questions in philosophy. Crucially the book introduces the major thinkers whose work proved influential in the development of Wittgenstein's thought, including Frege, Russell and Schopenhauer. This is the ideal introduction for anyone coming to the work of this challenging thinker for the first time. \nAbout the Author\nChon Tejedor is a Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Oxford, UK \n\nPaperback: 200 pages \nPublisher: Continuum (March 31, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf2948711d4e1d5f8cc59cb53d93ca5a23cabd0","amp;dn":"Starting+with+Wittgenstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf2948711d4e1d5f8cc59cb53d93ca5a23cabd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,242,148,135,17,212,225,213,248,204,89,203,83,217,60,165,162,60,171,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
