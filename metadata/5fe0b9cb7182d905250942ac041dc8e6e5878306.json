Johnson\n\nEnglish | 30 July 2015 | ISBN: 1491933399, 1449304680 | 164 Pages | \n\nThe modern human animal spends upwards of 11 hours out of every 24 in a state of constant consumption. Not eating, but gorging on information ceaselessly spewed from the screens and speakers we hold dear. Just as we have grown morbidly obese on sugar, fat, and flourÃ¢â‚¬â€so, too, have we become gluttons for texts, instant messages, emails, RSS feeds, downloads, videos, status updates, and tweets.\nWe're all battling a storm of distractions, buffeted with notifications and tempted by tasty tidbits of information. And just as too much junk food can lead to obesity, too much junk information can lead to cluelessness. The Information Diet shows you how to thrive in this information glutÃ¢â‚¬â€what to look for, what to avoid, and how to be selective. In the process, author Clay Johnson explains the role information has played throughout history, and why following his prescribed diet is essential for everyone who strives to be smart, productive, and sane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fe0b9cb7182d905250942ac041dc8e6e5878306","amp;dn":"The+Information+Diet%3A+A+Case+for+Conscious+Comsumption+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fe0b9cb7182d905250942ac041dc8e6e5878306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,224,185,203,113,130,217,5,37,9,66,172,4,29,200,230,229,135,131,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
