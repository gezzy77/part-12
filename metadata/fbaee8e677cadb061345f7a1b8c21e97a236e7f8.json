Eugenides&amp;#039;s command of the narrative is astonishing. He balances Cal/Callie&amp;#039;s shifting voices convincingly, spinning this strange and often unsettling story with intelligence, insight, and generous amounts of humor:\n\n    Emotions, in my experience aren&amp;#039;t covered by single words. I don&amp;#039;t believe in &quot;sadness,&quot; &quot;joy,&quot; or &quot;regret.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ I&amp;#039;d like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic traincar constructions like, say, &quot;the happiness that attends disaster.&quot; Or: &quot;the disappointment of sleeping with one&amp;#039;s fantasy.&quot; ... I&amp;#039;d like to have a word for &quot;the sadness inspired by failing restaurants&quot; as well as for &quot;the excitement of getting a room with a minibar.&quot; I&amp;#039;ve never had the right words to describe my life, and now that I&amp;#039;ve entered my story, I need them more than ever.\n\nWhen you get to the end of this splendorous book, when you suddenly realize that after hundreds of pages you have only a few more left to turn over, you&amp;#039;ll experience a quick pang of regret knowing that your time with Cal is coming to a close, and you may even resist finishing it--putting it aside for an hour or two, or maybe overnight--just so that this wondrous, magical novel might never end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbaee8e677cadb061345f7a1b8c21e97a236e7f8","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Eugenides+-+Middlesex+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbaee8e677cadb061345f7a1b8c21e97a236e7f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,174,232,230,119,202,219,6,19,69,247,161,184,194,30,151,162,54,231,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
