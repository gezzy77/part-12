They announced plans to break up in 2004, and played their final concert at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City on February 28, 2005.\n\nThe original line-up was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994&amp;#039;s Bewitched. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997&amp;#039;s Pup Tent, and Britta Phillips of Belltower (also known as the singing voice of animated character Jem) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17159092ca5488fbb1a6f89a64fa189ae6c60e10","amp;dn":"Luna+-+9+albums%2C+2+eps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17159092ca5488fbb1a6f89a64fa189ae6c60e10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,21,144,146,202,84,136,251,177,166,248,154,100,250,24,154,230,198,14,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
