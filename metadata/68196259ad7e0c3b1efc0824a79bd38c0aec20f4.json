The album marks the final Rush work prior to the events in Neil Peart's life that put the band on hiatus for several years. Peart recorded a majority of his drum tracks for the album using traditional grip, after receiving drum lessons from jazz instructor Freddie Gruber.\n\nThe cover denotes an inukshuk, native to the band's home country of Canada. Created by the Inuit, an inuksuk is a stone figure in the shape of a human used to mark a food cache, hunting ground or a place where someone lost their life.\n\nThe title track reached #1 on the mainstream rock chart. &quot;Driven&quot; became a bass showcase for bassist Geddy Lee during live performances, while &quot;Resist&quot; was rearranged as an acoustic song on the Vapor Trails and R30 tours.\n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (Lifeson, Lee, Peart, Pye Dubois) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:56\n    &quot;Driven&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:27\n    &quot;Half the World&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n    &quot;The Color of Right&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n    &quot;Time and Motion&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n    &quot;Totem&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n    &quot;Dog Years&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56\n    &quot;Virtuality&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:43\n    &quot;Resist&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;Limbo&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:28\n    &quot;Carve Away the Stone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68196259ad7e0c3b1efc0824a79bd38c0aec20f4","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Test+For+Echo+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68196259ad7e0c3b1efc0824a79bd38c0aec20f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,25,98,89,173,126,12,59,30,252,8,36,167,155,211,140,10,236,32,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
