You do not require any previous patches for this to work.\r\nThis will work for the GOG version of the game without affecting your save files.\r\n\r\n#################################\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nUPDATE: AMD Phenom Support:\r\nThousands of lines of assembly have been \r\nrewritten to support AMD CPUs. The game code \r\nno longer relies on anything above SSE 2,\r\nHavok Physics has also now created new libs. \r\nGame is now confirmed working on Phenom CPUs. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Mouse Smoothing\r\nSmoothing on mouse movement has been improved \r\nto prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now \r\nadjustable through the Options menu in â€œMouse \r\nSmoothingâ€. It now defaults to off. If you feel \r\nthe framerate is &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;lumpy&quot;, please \r\nmake sure that this is turned off (it helps \r\nplayers with sub-30 fps) \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Improved Performance\r\nOn CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance \r\nhas been improved. On CPUs with 8 threads, \r\nperformance has also been significantly improved. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Radeon 6xxx\r\nAdded support for this GPU, which doesn't support \r\nOpenGL 4.5 fully. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Player Saves\r\nHelp to recover some player saves which had \r\nbeen lost or corrupt. \r\n\r\nAlt-Tab has improved\r\nSome systems/configs were crashing or not pausing \r\ncorrectly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. \r\n\r\nShader Caching\r\nFramerate was initially stuttering due to shaders \r\nnot being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. \r\nWe have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice \r\nsome stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game \r\n(the very first time you run), but it should be smoother \r\nfrom then on (this will be fixed in future). This is \r\nparticularly true on ATI cards \r\n\r\nMax FPS Cap\r\nOn some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS \r\nto 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS \r\n(causing stuttering). This has been improved. \r\n\r\nIntel GPU Detection\r\nWe do not currently support Intel GPUS. We are \r\nworking on this for a future patch, to expand \r\nour min spec. In the meantime, the game will \r\nnow let you know if you are trying to run with \r\nan unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for \r\nsome users that their high end GPU has not been selected. \r\n\r\nGsync\r\nGsync has been disabled by default, which was \r\ncausing an issue for some users","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976a8e1ef926b6af8b71c3debaade659630eeaad","amp;dn":"No+Man%27s+Sky+Patch+1+GOG+Update+2.1.0.3+-+18th+Aug+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976a8e1ef926b6af8b71c3debaade659630eeaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,106,142,30,249,38,182,175,139,113,195,222,186,173,230,89,99,14,234,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
