Unabridged.\n\nThe Mark of Athena is the third installment of The Heroes of Olympus series\n\nThis torrent is a re-encoding of this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7715046/The_Mark_of_Athena by sven_kirk\n\n  I took the files and meged all the files from one disc together and encoded them at am much lower bitrate.\n\n   Encoding: MP3, 32kbps, Mono, 22 khz  This may seem like poor quality, but for an audio book it's decent.  It \n\nshrinks the total size from 1.62GB to 207MB.\n\n I have listened to the whole thing, there are a couple spots were there is some distortion (I'm pretty sure this \n\nwas in the original) but it's short and doesn't make you miss anything.\n\n  Anyway I've used so many torrents I decided to try providing one.  Hope you enjoy, I'll keep seeding as long as \n\nthere seems to be interest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295a6dfb215b9d95cbc6fdf6787adcc574f7baa5","amp;dn":"The+Mark+of+Athena+by+Rick+Riordan+Audio+Book+Unabridged.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295a6dfb215b9d95cbc6fdf6787adcc574f7baa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,90,109,251,33,91,157,149,203,198,253,246,120,122,220,197,116,247,186,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
