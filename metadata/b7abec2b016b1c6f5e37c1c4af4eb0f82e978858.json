MIKE OLDFIELD's influence together with the fact that the groups was signed up by the multinational label (WARNER) took the group to the heights of its fame with successful tours all over Spain. So far over 50,000 copies of the record have been sold, making it one of the few Galician groups with a gold record. It is worth repeating that thanks to this record the group has not only been very well received by the critics but has also been awarded several important prizes.\n\n01 O son do ar\n02 Tu gitana\n03 Ao-Tea-Roa\n04 RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­o Xordo\n05 Os teus ollos\n06 Ronsel\n07 Pola Pomte de San XoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n\n08 Pandeirada das Fiandeiras de Ramelle\n09 Sol de outono\n10 Cantiga de Falvan\n11 Romance de Bernaldino e SabeliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a\n12 Galaecia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7abec2b016b1c6f5e37c1c4af4eb0f82e978858","amp;dn":"Luar+Na+Lubre...Plenilunio%281997%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7abec2b016b1c6f5e37c1c4af4eb0f82e978858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,171,236,43,1,107,28,111,94,55,193,196,175,78,176,248,46,151,136,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
