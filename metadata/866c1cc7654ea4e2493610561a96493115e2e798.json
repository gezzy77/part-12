After being cut, this object collapses into four cylindrical pieces, each about the size of a tube train. Each is densely packed with either alien technology or some kind of life. They are placed for safety in three ozark cylinders of a massively secure space station. There a female research scientist subsequently falls pregnant, and gives birth to quads. Then she commits suicide - but why? By the end of the war one of the contesting planets has been devastated by the hilldiggers - giant space dreadnoughts employing weapons capable of creating mountain ranges. The quads have meanwhile grown up and are assuming positions of power in the post-war society. One of them will eventually gain control of the awesome hilldiggers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866c1cc7654ea4e2493610561a96493115e2e798","amp;dn":"Neal+Asher+-++Hilldiggers+%5BPolity+%232%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866c1cc7654ea4e2493610561a96493115e2e798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,108,28,199,101,78,164,226,73,54,16,86,26,150,73,49,21,226,231,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
