The mere mention of their name today evokes images of suntanned California teens dancing and surfing on the beaches of Malibu. The ultimate good-time music act of the early '60s -- who only earned one gold record (for &quot;Surf City&quot;) -- the duo get credit for inspiring lots of smiles and providing the soundtrack to countless parties, but few listeners, critics, or pop culture historians appreciate just how important they were musically during the first half of the 1960s, or how long it took them to achieve the level of craftsmanship that characterized their music as much as their high harmonies and catchy choruses. Even becoming &quot;Jan &amp; Dean&quot; wasn't easy for this duo. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifoxqe5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fifoxqe5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThis CD collects two albums released within weeks of each other in 1964. The title tracks from both albums were hits, as was &quot;Sidewalk Surfin'&quot; and &quot;The Anaheim, Azusa &amp; Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review &amp; Timing Association,&quot; the latter of which boasts one of the longest song titles in the history of the Billboard charts. Ride the Wild Surf is devoted to surf, beach, and skateboard music, and ends with a comedy skit somewhat reminiscent of the Smothers Brothers. The Little Old Lady From Pasadena is more varied, adding hot rod songs, novelties, and the gorgeous pure pop of &quot;It's as Easy as 1, 2, 3.&quot; The CD adds a previously unreleased take of &quot;The Little Old Lady From Pasadena&quot; as a bonus. Like the Beach Boys' albums of the period, these albums show the duo creating more sophisticated compositions and stretching their thematic boundaries.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gbfyxqw5ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gbfyxqw5ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReview for Ride The Wild Surf: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxftxql5ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxftxql5ldse&lt;/a&gt;\nReview for The Little Old Lady From Pasadena: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:09fqxq95ldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:09fqxq95ldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Ride-Wild-Surf-Little-Pasadena/dp/B000008GZD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Ride-Wild-Surf-Little-Pasadena/dp/B000008GZD&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
