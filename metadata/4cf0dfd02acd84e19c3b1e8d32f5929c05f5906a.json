Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Penn Jillette\n\n\nNot only can the man rant, he can write. From the larger, louder half of the world-famous magic duo Penn &amp; Teller comes a scathingly funny reinterpretation of The Ten Commandments. They are The Penn Commandments, and they reveal one outrageous and opinionated atheist's experience in the world. In this rollicking yet honest account of a godless existence, Penn takes readers on a roller coaster of exploration and flips conventional religious wisdom on its ear to reveal that doubt, skepticism, and wonder -- all signs of a general feeling of disbelief -- are to be celebrated and cherished, rather than suppressed. And he tells some pretty damn funny stories along the way. From performing blockbuster shows on the Vegas Strip to the adventures of fatherhood, from an on-going dialogue with proselytizers of the Christian Right to the joys of sex while scuba diving, Jillette's self-created Decalogue invites his reader on a journey of discovery that is equal parts wise and wisecracking\nUnabridged.\nRead By Penn Jillette. .\n\n--------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n--------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf0dfd02acd84e19c3b1e8d32f5929c05f5906a","amp;dn":"God%2C+No%21+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Penn+Jillette","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf0dfd02acd84e19c3b1e8d32f5929c05f5906a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,240,223,208,42,205,132,225,156,59,30,141,50,245,146,156,5,245,144,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
