There are several recording from the mid 1980's that are questionable both in sound quality and song selection but not here.\n\n&quot;Voyage&quot; easily establishes Getz as perhaps the finest lyrical tenor saxophone player ever, building upon a foundation laid down by the likes of Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster.\n\nGetz often referred to Barron as his musical soul mate and the chemistry is undeniable in this jazz masterpiece.\n\nEasy to enjoy, difficult to classify, Voyage is one of Getz finest recordings.\n\n\nSTAN GETZ\n\nVoyage     1986\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
