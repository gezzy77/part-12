The purpose of the book is to provide a complete and self-contained treatment, which includes the basic underlying mathematics and numerics, examples from population dynamics and engineering applications, and Matlab programs implementing the proposed numerical methods. A number of proofs is given to furnish a solid foundation, but the emphasis is on the (unifying) idea of the pseudospectral technique for the stability analysis of DDEs. It is aimed at advanced students and researchers in applied mathematics, in dynamical systems and in various fields of science and engineering, concerned with delay systems. A relevant feature of the book is that it also provides the Matlab codes to encourage the readers to experience the practical aspects. They could use the codes to test the theory and to analyze the performances of the methods on the given examples. Moreover, they could easily modify them to tackle the numerical stability analysis of their own delay models.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (December 14, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1493921061\nISBN-13: 978-1493921065","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d30bb0f4270778ff1f58474a81e284c5cd3b4edd","amp;dn":"Stability+of+Linear+Delay+Differential+Equations+A+Numerical+App","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d30bb0f4270778ff1f58474a81e284c5cd3b4edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,11,176,244,39,7,120,255,31,88,71,74,129,226,132,197,205,59,78,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
