Regardless of any blues album rankings...they are truly MUST OWN albums. The albums are listed in no particular order except for the number one listing. King of the Delta Blues Singers is a compilation album by American blues musician Robert Johnson, released in 1961 on Columbia Records. It is considered one of the greatest and most influential blues releases ever.. I hope you enjoy this collection and I will be releasing further collections in the near future.\n\n01.Robert Johnson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ King Of The Delta Blues Singers\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to overstate the importance of Robert JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence on the sound of modern music. His ghostly wail and precise finger picking style, combined with tales of hellhounds and cheating women, set the bar for what a blues singer should sound like (and, since rock was born out of the bluesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well, you connect the dots). And his personal background is one of the most interesting and hotly debated stories in the history of music. An oft-told tale has Johnson meeting the Devil at the crossroads and trading his soul for the musical skills that would make him a legend.\n\nBut the songs are the real story here: Ã¢â‚¬ËœSweet Home ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m A Steady RollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRamblinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On My MindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœStop BreakinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Down BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Red HotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove In Vain BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with nearly everything else he recorded in his short life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ would go on to become standards, and have been covered by everyone from Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones to The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Eric Clapton. JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence was particularly rampant during the mid-to-late 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s when many young rockers (including Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, and Clapton) turned to him for inspiration as well as material. And while Johnson had a deep influence on the British blues, his hold on musicians continues into the 21st century in the songs of the White Stripes and others. As long as music is being made, Robert JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence will continue to resonate.\n\n02.Billie Holiday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Songs For Distingue Lovers\nTo her core, Lady Day was a blues singer. A life filled with hard living, hard relationships, and hard drugs gave her first hand insight into what constituted the blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and ultimately led to her early grave. But none of that should overshadow her accomplishments as a singer. In terms of vocal phrasing, Holiday stands as one of the finest singers of the 20th century Ã¢â‚¬â€œ along with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye. Like those artists, her voice seems to come from within in the song, and any tune she put it to is instantly hers.\n\nShe sings like a woman whose heart was recently removed by way of her throat, so it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter if she were backed by Xavier Cugat or Carl Stalling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billie Holiday always sang the blues. Here, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backed by Jimmy Rowles, Ben Webster and Barney Kessel, among other jazz musicians, but her voice epitomizes unendurable pain, endless struggle, and utter hopelessness. Songs For Distingue Lovers is as good a place as any to begin discovering the genius of Billie Holiday. Taking perversely happy songs and lending them her distinct touch, she turns tales of happiness and found love into gut wrenching takes on anguish and loss. Pure and bitter genius.\n\n03.Mississippi John Hurt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1928 Sessions\nMississippi John HurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story reads like a blues fairy tale. A farm laborer from Avalon, Mississippi, Hurt recorded a number of sides in 1928 for the Okeh label. But the great depression effectively ended his recording career before it gained any traction, and he returned to Avalon to resume working as a laborer. In 1963, record collector Tom Hoskins pieced together clues from HurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs, found him in Avalon, and convinced him to resume his music career. Hurt was instantly recognized as a lost treasure, and began a healthy touring and recording schedule, releasing three albums and playing to coffeehouses across the country. Alas, his re-found fame was cut short when he passed away in 1966. 1928 Sessions captures Hurt in his young glory before he went into deep freeze. His finger picking is absolutely unparalleled in the history of Blues music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just listen to Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrankieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for evidence. A mellow, soulful singer, HurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laid back style makes him instantly recognizable and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\n04.Bessie Smith Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Complete Recordings, Vol. 1\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Empress Of The BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ possessed a voice powerful enough to cut through the hiss and scratch of primitive recordings and leap across the chasm of time. No other singer from the 1910Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s &amp; 20Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s still sounds as fresh, vital, and imposing as Bessie Smith. She was one of the first stars of recorded music, and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t uncommon for her more popular sides to sell nearly a million copies. The majority of her songs were recorded before 1929, when the Great Depression essentially put the recording industry out of business.\n\nThe Complete Recordings, Vol. 1 is the first set in a series that collects all of her recorded work on 5 two-disc sets. The music here was recorded between February 1923 and April 1924 and features her mostly just accompanied by piano. From Ã¢â‚¬ËœDownhearted BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ all the way through to Ã¢â‚¬ËœHateful BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is equal parts iron and velvet, and she sings like a woman who would Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and has Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spit in the face of the devil himself.\n\nBefore she died in 1937 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at age 43, from injuries sustained in an automobile accident Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she laid a foundation of blues songs that have influenced generations of female singers, including Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin, &amp; Norah Jones. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one Bessie Smith, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right here, waiting to reach out across nearly 100 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ time and tell you just how it is.\n\n05.Reverend Gary Davis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harlem Street Singer\nDavis was born partially blind and lost his sight completely before he reached adulthood. He turned to the church in part to cope with this burden, and in 1933 was ordained as a Baptist minister. In the late 50Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s he found favor with the secular folk crowd, and began to have an influence on players of that era including Dave Van Ronk, Bob Dylan, and eventually, Jerry Garcia. His picking style was born out of a badly broken and poorly set left wrist that forced him to finger his notes at an odd angle. But his vocal intensity was no accident Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Davis sang with a fire that matched the brimstone in his songs. Harlem Street Singer displays the eclectic mix of song styles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ragtime, marches, gospel, field songs, and more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that he brought together through his incomparable voice and singular style.\n\n06.Skip James Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Complete Early Recordings Of Skip James Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1930\nEarly Recordings is one of the scariest albums ever recorded in any genre, under any circumstances. JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unearthly wail is the sound of a tormented spirit corkscrewing away from its earthly body. When he sings Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jesus is coming to this world again/Coming to judge the hearts of menÃ¢â‚¬Å“, he sounds like a leering devil who sees all your sins and gleefully knows how youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be judged. The quality of these recordings is terrible, but the sheets of hiss and scratch sound like black rain and actually add to the overall creepy effect. Refreshingly spared the digital sanitization that almost every other reissue of the compact disc era has undergone, this is a hair-raising journey down the darkest side street of the Blues.\n\n07.Albert King Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Born Under A Bad Sign\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“He can take four notes and write a volume,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ guitarist Mike Bloomfield once said of Albert King. His minimalist blues styling is in a perfect setting here, backed by the Memphis Horns, Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and many other Stax/Volt luminaries. More a collection of singles than a proper album, Born Under A Bad Sign influenced a whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who of rock, including Clapton, Hendrix, Peter Green, and others. More importantly, it fused soul, R&amp;B and the Blues into a stout mixture that would reinvigorate interest in a sagging genre and ensure that King would be forever (and rightly) known as a Blues legend and one of the most influential musicians of all-time.\n\n08.Howlin' Wolf - His Best: Chess 50th Anniversary Collection\nChester Arthur Burnett, known as Howlin' Wolf, was an influential American blues singer, guitarist and harmonica player. With a booming voice and looming physical presence, he is one of the best-known Chicago blues artists.\n\n09.Lonnie Johnson with Victoria Spivey - 1962 - Idle Hours\nJohnson and Victoria Spivey had known one another for decades (they duetted on the ribald &quot;Toothache Blues&quot; way back in 1928), so it's no surprise that their musical repartee on 1961's Idle Hours seems so natural and playful. Spivey guests on three tracks (including the title number) and plays piano on her one solo entry. Johnson does the majority of the disc without her, benefitting from pianistic accompaniment by Cliff Jackson.\n\n10.Blind Willie McTell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Definitive Blind Willie McTell\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sang Bob Dylan in his song named and written for this blues titan. Virtually ignored in his lifetime, McTell wrote songs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœThree Women BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“one for the morning/one for late at night/I got one for noon time/to treat your old daddy rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that sound like a cross between Luther Campbell and Robert Johnson. That is, impeccably sung tales of love, lust and betrayal. And Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like virtually every other name on this list Ã¢â‚¬â€œ McTell has a long list of disciples (including Taj Mahal, Nirvana, Dylan, and White Stripes) and sings like heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunted by the very hounds of hell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:711a437d3b84b1261ffaff2c4ad0ab075aa7f983","amp;dn":"Ten+Must+Have+Essential+Blues+Albums+%5B-emidius-%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"711a437d3b84b1261ffaff2c4ad0ab075aa7f983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,26,67,125,59,132,177,38,31,250,255,44,74,208,171,7,90,167,249,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
