Enter Sarah Boston: a vet who suspects a suspicious growth in her neck is thyroid cancer. From the moment she uses her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portable ultrasound machine to investigate her lump Ã¢â‚¬â€ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a vet, too Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear Lucky Dog is not your typical cancer memoir. She takes us on a hysterical and thought-provoking journey through the human healthcare system from the perspective of an animal doctor. Weaving funny and poignant stories of dogs sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treated along the way, this is an insightful memoir about what the human medical world can learn from the way we treat our canine counterparts. Lucky Dog teaches us to trust our instincts, be our own advocates, and laugh while weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b38c1f4c5574d57053b4aab137587f0fe4ecec","amp;dn":"Lucky+Dog+%28Dr.+Sarah+Boston%29+Retail+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b38c1f4c5574d57053b4aab137587f0fe4ecec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,179,140,31,76,85,116,213,112,83,180,170,177,55,88,127,15,228,236,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
