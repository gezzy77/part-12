I have a low  success rate, but \nit's all good fun, regardless.\n\nI understand that the MIT LOCK PICKING GUIDE is one\nof the more recent 'bibles' for such 'hobbies', but\nmost copies I've come across have been re-hashed so\nmuch  that  the  text  and/or  diagrams were mostly \nmessed up and of v.low quality.  So I decided to do\nsomething about it...\n\nThis PDF file is NOT  a  re-edited  version, as all\ncontent is as  the  original  release  from Ted The\nTool  -  all I've done is reformatted the text into\nsomething  better  than that  godawful Courier type\nand  tidied up the overall presentation.  Also I've\ntaken  the  opportunity to bookmark  all topics and\ndiagrams, for further ease of use.  Oh yeah... it's\nnow got a decent jacket cover too, for those of you\nwho might want to print to hard copy. ^^\n\nI claim  no  credit for this update nor have I made\nany  such  claims in the document itself.  It's all\njust a  lil  bit of house-keeping for what I see as\none of the best lock picking guides available.\n\nI am  distributing  this  for  educational purposes\nONLY  and  DO NOT in any  way  support  the  use of\nsuch  practices   for  illegally  entering  peoples\npremises  or  stealing   other  people's  property.\n\n\nEnjoy\nAnon...\n\n\n* Comments are always welcome ^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cb777c5598ef3fad8da24325a2e705401abe729","amp;dn":"MIT+Lock+Picking+Guide+%5BUpdated+Format+2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cb777c5598ef3fad8da24325a2e705401abe729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,183,119,197,89,142,243,250,216,218,36,50,90,46,112,84,1,171,231,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
