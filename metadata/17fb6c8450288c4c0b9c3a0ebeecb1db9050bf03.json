The superfreak dressed 'em up in skimpy outfits and provocative costumes, and had them sing songs very reminiscent of James -- actually, it's probably more accurate to say that the sound was closer to Prince or one of his protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, because there was a heavily Minneapolis vibe to his songs and productions for the Mary Jane Girls. They hit a home run once, with the spectacular &quot;In My House,&quot; one of the great urban funk songs of the mid-'80s. They never got that good again, although they almost hit the Top 40 with &quot;Wild and Crazy Love&quot; and &quot;Walk Like a Man.&quot; Those three songs, along with a bunch of other singles, R&amp;B hits, and album tracks are on 20th Century Masters, as good a retrospective as could be assembled on the Girls. It's not totally comprehensive, but it does have anything that anybody would want to hear, and while it won't make a case for the girls or James as a Svengali, it's pretty enjoyable for those that want to hear songs like &quot;In My House,&quot; only not as memorable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17fb6c8450288c4c0b9c3a0ebeecb1db9050bf03","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters%3A+The+Best+of+the+Mary+Jane+Girls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17fb6c8450288c4c0b9c3a0ebeecb1db9050bf03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,251,108,132,80,40,140,76,11,156,58,14,190,236,177,219,144,80,191,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
