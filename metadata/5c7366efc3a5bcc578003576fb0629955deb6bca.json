Dark Side of a Dream (DSOAD):  an audio mix conceived in mid 2001, released around 2003 on various sharing sites.\n\n2. Passage: Follow up audio production to DSOAD dedicated to the life of Syd Barrett\n\n3. Dark Side of  a Dream Revisited:  A remolded audio production of DSOAD to be the main soundtrack for &quot;Truth and Delusion&quot;\n\n4. Truth and Delusion: An experimental film using various video clips.\n\n5. Sound Scheme:  Designed for Win XP to replace stock sound with PF effects.\n\n6. Podcast file: Some of my work was featured on the Doc's show back in 2007.\n\nEach folder has its own description from the original releases.\n\nEach piece in this collection (except for the podcast) was done solely by me, Ray Kolling, as an experiment in creativity and personal growth.  I think that if I had not made them, I would not be the same man I am today.\n\nNone of the files here are intended for sale.  This site is being used mainly as a personal archive so that I may retrieve the collection in case of hard drive failure.\n\nSpecial thanks to leahcim3360 for his support and friendship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7366efc3a5bcc578003576fb0629955deb6bca","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+A+Collection+of+Curious+Collages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7366efc3a5bcc578003576fb0629955deb6bca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,115,102,239,195,165,188,197,120,0,53,118,251,6,41,149,93,235,107,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
