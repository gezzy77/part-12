The processing of these specifications, made by mathematical models of different complexity, starts always from the presentations of the needs of the customer using the vehicle and from the large number of rules imposed by laws and customs.\n\n The two volumes are completed by references, list of symbols adopted and subjects index.\n\nThese two books about the vehicle body may be added to those about the chassis and are part of a series sponsored by ATA (the Italian automotive engineers association) on the subject of automotive engineering; they follow the first book, published in 2005 in Italian only, about automotive transmission.\n\nThey cover automotive engineering from every aspect and are the result of a five-year collaboration between the Polytechnical University of Turin and the University of Naples on automotive engineering.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 692 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (December 21, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9400705123\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9400705128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e54039662b4c4c7b8afbfa91fd4742c5730bb0","amp;dn":"The+Automotive+Body%3A+Volume+I%3A+Components+Design%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e54039662b4c4c7b8afbfa91fd4742c5730bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,229,64,57,102,43,76,76,123,138,251,250,145,253,71,66,197,115,11,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
