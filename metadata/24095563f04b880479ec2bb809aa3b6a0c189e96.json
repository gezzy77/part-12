For subscribers only, this double-CD comes packaged in a U2.com LP-sized 24-page book and will not become commercially available.\r\n\r\nOn U2360Â° between 2009 and 2011, the band played 110 shows in 30 countries to 7 million people. There were at least 22 songs in the show every night, but over 26 months the set list was continually reinvented. By the last night more than fifty songs had featured, stretching from 2009's No Line On The Horizon all the way back to 1980's debut Boy. It was down to the subscribers of U2.com to decide on the 22 songs (via a vote) that appear on the 'U22'.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDisc One:\r\n\r\n01.
