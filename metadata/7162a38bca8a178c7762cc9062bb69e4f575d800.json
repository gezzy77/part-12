After the mainstream success of &quot;Loser&quot;, Odelay featured several hit singles, including &quot;Where It's At&quot;, &quot;Devils Haircut&quot;, and &quot;The New Pollution&quot;. The album peaked at #16 on the Billboard 200 chart and eventually sold over 2 million copies in the United States. It was also Beck's first hit album in the United Kingdom, making #17; it has since gone platinum in the UK.\n\nMusical style\nThe sessions for what would become Odelay originally began as a subdued, acoustic affair. In 1994, Beck started to record tracks for his follow-up to Mellow Gold with Bong Load producers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf. Hansen had recently experienced a number of personal tragedies (including the death of his grandfather, Al Hansen), and the tone of the songs as well as their production were considerably somber. Only a handful of tracks from these sessions have been released: &quot;Ramshackle&quot;, &quot;Feather in Your Cap&quot;, and &quot;Brother&quot;. All three of these songs are acoustic, sparse, and melancholic, and have a haunting sound very different from the more upbeat, &quot;party&quot; style of Odelay. Beck would eventually return to this downbeat style with his 1998 album, Mutations.\n\nHe would eventually abandon work with Rothrock and Schnapf, opting to work with the Dust Brothers instead. The Dust Brothers' production style was notably more upbeat and hip-hop-focused; their rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© included work with The Beastie Boys and Tone Loc.\n\nTitle and artwork\nThe title is a phonetic English rendering of the Mexican slang interjection &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³rale.&quot; The phrase &quot;odelay&quot; is repeated in the lyrics during the outro of the song &quot;Lord Only Knows&quot;.\n\nThe album's unusual cover photo, which has been misinterpreted as a mop head jumping over a hurdle, is actually a real photo of a Komondor, a rare Hungarian breed of dog with thick matted hair. The image was chosen at the last minute after Beck failed to decide on an album cover. The image was presented to him by his girlfriend and was chosen almost out of desperation. The typeface was chosen by a record company worker.\n\nReception\nOdelay won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1997, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Where It's At'. It was ranked 16 in Spin's &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005&quot;. It was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, and also in the NME's annual critics poll. In 1998, Q magazine readers voted Odelay the 51st greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 305 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Voters in Channel 4's 2005 &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; poll placed it at number 73. The music website Pitchfork Media ranked it at #19 on their top 100 albums of the 1990s.\n\nTrack listing\nSide A\n&quot;Devils Haircut&quot; - 3:15\n&quot;Hotwax&quot; - 3:49\n&quot;Lord Only Knows&quot; - 4:15\n&quot;The New Pollution&quot; - 3:39\n\nSide B\n&quot;Derelict&quot; - 4:13\n&quot;Novacane&quot; - 4:37\n&quot;Jack-Ass&quot; - 4:12\n&quot;Where It's At&quot; - 5:30\n\nSide C\n&quot;Minus&quot; - 2:32\n&quot;Sissyneck&quot; - 3:57\n&quot;Readymade&quot; - 2:37\n&quot;High 5 (Rock the Catskills)&quot; - 4:11\n&quot;Ramshackle&quot; - 4:47\n\nSide D\n&quot;Deadweight&quot; - 6:12\n&quot;Inferno&quot; (previously unreleased) - 7:03\n&quot;Gold Chains&quot; (previously unreleased) - 4:59\n\nSuide E\n&quot;Where It's At&quot; (U.N.K.L.E. remix) - 12:26\n&quot;Richard's Hairpiece&quot; (remix by Aphex Twin) - 3:19\n&quot;American Wasteland&quot; (remix by Mickey P.) - 2:42\n\nSide F\n&quot;Clock&quot; - 3:17\n&quot;Thunderpeel&quot; - 2:40\nDifferent version than the one on Stereopathetic Soulmanure.\n&quot;Electric Music and the Summer People&quot; - 4:38\n&quot;Lemonade&quot; - 2:21\n\nSide G\n&quot;SA-5&quot; - 1:53\n&quot;Feather in Your Cap&quot; - 3:46\n&quot;Erase the Sun&quot; - 2:56\nSped up from the originally released length of 3:16.\n&quot;000.000&quot; - 5:25\n&quot;Brother&quot; - 4:47\n\nSide H\n&quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot; - 4:34\n&quot;Trouble All My Days&quot; - 2:25\n&quot;Strange Invitation&quot; - 4:06\n&quot;Burro&quot; - 3:13\n\nPersonnel\nBeck ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, acoustic guitar, bass, harmonica, percussion, celeste, drums, electric guitar, keyboards, electric piano, vocals, clavinet, producer, slide guitar, art direction, design, mixing\nMike Boito ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, trumpet\nMario Caldato, Jr. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ producer, mixing\nCharlie Haden ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nGreg Leisz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pedal steel\nBob Ludwig ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mastering, photography\nMike Millius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ screams\nBrian Paulson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ producer, mixing\nTom Rothrock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ producer, mixing\nRob Schnapf ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ producer, mixing\nJoey Waronker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, drums\nDust Brothers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ producer, mixing\nRobert Fisher ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ art direction, design\nNitin Vadukul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ photography\nZarim Osborn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ artwork, collage\nAl Hansen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ artwork, collage\nShauna O'Brien ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ coordination, production coordination\nManuel Ocampo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ artwork, paintings, collage\nDavid Brown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\nRoss Harris (The Enchanting Wizard of Rhythm)\nDavid Campbell - arranger\n\nProfessional ratings\nPitchfork Media (1996) (9.8/10)\nPitchfork Media (8.5/10) Deluxe Edition\nAllmusic 5 / 5 Stars\nSlant Magazine 5 / 5 Stars\nThe Austin Chronicle 4 / 5 Stars\nRobert Christgau (A-)\nRS Album Guide 5 / 5 Stars\nRolling Stone 5 /5 Stars Deluxe Edition\n\n\n\nTechnical Log\nRCM Hannl 'limited' with &quot;Rotating Brush&quot;\nMusic Hall MMF 9.1 Turntable\nTonearm: Pro-Ject 9cc evo with Pure Silver Wires\nCartridge: Nagaoka MP-500\nBrocksieper Phonomax (Tube Phono PreAmp)\nE-MU 0404 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections : Silent Wire NF5\nWaveLab 6 recording software\niZotope RX Advanced 1.21 for resampling and dithering\n\nVacuum cleaning &gt; TT &gt; Brocksieper Phonomax &gt; E-MU 0404 &gt; WaveLab 6 (24/192) &gt; manual click removal &gt; analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) &gt; converted to 24/96 (16/44.1) with iZotope RX Advanced 1.21 &gt; split into individual Tracks &gt; FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.\n\nPersonal Note\nWith my vinyl transfers, I try to catch the whole beauty of vinyl records; therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improvement. What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, &quot;Life is full of surface noises.&quot; In some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7162a38bca8a178c7762cc9062bb69e4f575d800","amp;dn":"Beck+-+Odelay+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%5BVinyl-180g%5D-aksman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7162a38bca8a178c7762cc9062bb69e4f575d800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,98,163,139,202,138,23,140,119,98,204,144,98,187,105,228,245,117,216,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
