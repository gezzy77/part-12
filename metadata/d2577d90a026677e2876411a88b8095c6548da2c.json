Working Hammerwatch 1.3 for Windows.\nContains 6 classes and both campaings. I don't know if multi works. For me - not. 0 servers everytime I check. I also don't have anyone for coop. Single works like a charm. I'm currently\ndeep in Act 3 with my Ranger (easier level). This is some kind of Steam rip. Of course Steam is not needed to run it.\n\nLast but not least, change Your name in-game. :)\nI've managed to change it from default (after installing you have &quot;John2s&quot;). I've enclosed my config.xml so you don't need to figure it out. Just open the file in Notepad and edit\nPatryk line. I've put my own, real name here but it can be anything.\n\nAs for compatibility - works perfectly in Windows 8.1.\n\nThanks for reading this file.\nEnjoy the game.\nRadTang\n\n\nIncluded files:\nSetup.exe (checked it with Comodo - 0 viruses)\nReadme.txt\nconfig.xml (to make name change easier - just edit the file and replace)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2577d90a026677e2876411a88b8095c6548da2c","amp;dn":"Hammerwatch+1.3+%28Windows%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2577d90a026677e2876411a88b8095c6548da2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,87,125,144,160,38,103,126,40,118,65,26,136,184,9,92,101,72,218,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
