This comes in handy if you want to share your menu design\nwith others.\n\n- Add music, image, and video to your menu\nAdd background music, favorite photos, and action videos to\nmake your menus come alive.\n\n- True drag and drop functionality\nAdjust the playing order of titles or chapters in the DVD\nsimply by dragging and dropping.
