Good Neighbor Sam is suitable for all ages, to be sure, but that doesn't stop producer-writer-director David Swift from injecting plenty of double-entendre dialogue and harmlessly risque situations. Lemmon plays ad executive Sam Bissell, happily married to all-American blonde Minerva (Dorothy Provine). Anxious to land the Nurdlinger's milk account, Sam is carefully scrutinized by the prudish Simon Nurdlinger (Edward G. Robinson), a staunch advocate of old-fashioned family values.\n\nMeanwhile, Minerva welcomes her old school friend, sexy Janet Langerlof (Romy Schneider) into her home. Janet is in line to inherit a fortune, but only if she's married. Unfortunately, Janet is currently separated from her insanely jealous spouse Howard Ebbets (Michael Connors), so big-hearted Minerva volunteers Sam to pose as Janet's husband. The ensuing comic complications come to a head when Nurdlinger elects Sam and Janet as the nation's ideal &quot;married&quot; couple, and posts their pictures on billboards all over town! Some of the smaller pleasures in this film are provided by Louis Nye as a high-tech private eye, Barbara Nichols as a squeaky-voiced call girl, Robert Q. Lewis as Sam's lascivious neighbor, and an uncredited Gil Lamb as a genial wino. An amusing running gag involved the Hertz &quot;man in the driver's seat&quot; commercials of the 1960s has sometimes been cut from TV prints of Good Neighbor Sam. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058153/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058153/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58153/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58153/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nDavid Swift\n\n        Jack Lemmon\t ... \tSam Bissell\n\tRomy Schneider\t... \tJanet Lagerlof\n\tDorothy Provine\t... \tMinerva Bissell\n\n\tMike Connors\t... \tHoward Ebbets (as Michael Connors)\n\tEdward Andrews\t... \tHarvey Burke\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:47:27\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x464  1.55:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1500 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,15 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f8d936153a5b1fd2aeeb7cc934b12c82d03e9a","amp;dn":"Good+Neighbor+Sam+%281964%29+Jack+Lemmon+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f8d936153a5b1fd2aeeb7cc934b12c82d03e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,248,217,54,21,58,91,31,210,174,235,124,201,52,177,44,130,208,62,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
