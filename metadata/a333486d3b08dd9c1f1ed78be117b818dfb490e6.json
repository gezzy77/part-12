Fitzsimmons is perhaps best known for his songs \\\\\\&quot;Passion Play\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Please Don\\\\\\'t Go,\\\\\\&quot; which aired during pivotal scenes in ABC\\\\\\'s medical drama Grey\\\\\\'s Anatomy.[1] His first two full-length albums, Until When We Are Ghosts (2005) and Goodnight (2006) were completely self-produced and recorded by Fitzsimmons at his former home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His most recent effort, 2008\\\\\\'s The Sparrow And The Crow was his first studio record, and impressively reached #1 on the iTunes Top Folk Albums chart, and #56 on the iTunes Top Albums chart. In addition to the above, his music has also been featured on ABC\\\\\\'s Brothers &amp; Sisters, MTV\\\\\\'s Life of Ryan, The CW\\\\\\'s One Tree Hill, ABC Family\\\\\\'s Greek, and Lifetime\\\\\\'s Army Wives, and he has been given reference in Billboard, Rolling Stone, Paste, Spin, Musikexpress, Uncut, Q Magazine, and Performing Songwriter Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nGold in the Shadow gets underway with the gorgeous new single The Tide Pulls From The Moon, a fair reflection of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s yet to come on William Fitzsimmons third album.\n\nA generally more uplifting collection than his bleak and intimate last effort The Sparrow And The Crow in 2008 which dealt with his personal feelings during the time of his marriage break up and divorce.\n\nRegardless of the content that album went on to become iTunes Best Folk Album of 2008 and Gold in the Shadow is destined to achieve at least a similar accolade if not a whole lot more.\n\nFitzsimmons is a gifted songwriter who conjures up images through his wonderful lyrics rather than storytelling, while weaving stunning melodies with his dexterous finger picking. His fragile and tender vocals will undoubtedly draw comparisons to Simon &amp; Garfunkel, in particular the early solo work of Paul Simon.\n\nThis is most apparent on the beautiful track Bird Of Winter Prey, but equally evident on the early tracks on the album Beautiful Girl, the uplifting The Winter From Her Leaving and Fade &amp; Then Return, while the quite excellent Psychasthenia pushes the album in to another dimension, evoking memories of Prefab Sprout with its heavenly hushed boy/girl vocals.\n\nThe duet Let You Break featuring Leigh Nash further demonstrates how the lush female vocal perfectly compliments the breathy fragility of Fitzsimmons own voice and songs, and is used to best effect on the haunting album closer What Hold.\n\nThe album is a sumptuous affair which simply seduces your ears rather than giving them a pounding, it gets better and better with every listen as appreciation of the excellent production and arrangements grow.\n\nThe theme that runs through Gold in the Shadows is focused on healing, it was two years after The Sparrow And The Crow was released before Fitzsimmons started writing again and he says;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI had reached the point where I was either going to yield to my sicknesses or engage them headlong,in either case I could no longer live how I was.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He describes the songs on the album as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa real and long coming confrontation with personal demons, past mistakes and the spectre of mental illness which has hovered over me for the great majority of my life.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nGold in the Shadow is a spellbinding album on which Fitzsimmons surpasses all expectations and has created not only a certain album of the year contender but possibly one of those rare essential classic recordings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.buzzinmusicblog.co.uk/william-fitzsimmons-gold-in-the-shadow-album-review/4096&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.buzzinmusicblog.co.uk/william-fitzsimmons-gold-in-the-shadow-album-review/4096&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
