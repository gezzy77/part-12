At the end of the last Ice Age, huge areas of land were submerged by rising sea levels - the same areas that are likely to have been inhabited by man. But archaeologists have concentrated their search for past civilisations on land and so date the dawn of civilisation to around 6,000 years ago. Hancock contends that underwater evidence points to a much earlier starting point for organised settlement.\n\nUsing the latest underwater technology and working with leading academics, Hancock sets out to prove his theory. At submerged sites off the coasts of India, in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Caribbean and in the seas between China and Japan, Hancock has discovered underwater monuments, temples and cities that he contends can only have been made by man when these areas were last above water - around 10,000 years ago.\n\n\nEpisode 2/3: India's Sunken Cities (2002) India's prehistoric past, including a tour of the Indus Valley to see what can be learned about early civilisations\n\nFile Name ..........: Graham Hancock - Underworld02.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 485,612,864 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 474,231 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 463.12 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 439,204,042 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 428,910 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 418.86 MB\nVideo Length .......: 00:48:20\nVideo Codec Code ...: DIVX\nVideo Codec Name ...: OpenDivX (DivX 4.0 and later)\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1211 KB/s\nResolution .........: 720 x 576\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.25:1\nTotal frames .......: 193313 frames\nframerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 24 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 4.382 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 46,400,000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 45,313 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 44.25 MB\nAudio Length .......: 00:00:08\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\nRip by Chinadoc; These files were converted to avi format from a ripped version of Underworld (PAL DVD) found on a public tracker.\n\n\n\nU/L; Not the best Pic or audio, but it's interesting\n\nEnjoy\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc97c6ba7a23904f65d302090365fb0f1996355","amp;dn":"Graham+Hancock+-+Underworld02.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc97c6ba7a23904f65d302090365fb0f1996355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,201,124,107,167,162,57,4,246,93,48,32,144,54,95,176,241,153,99,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
