But it is a new beginning.&quot; ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how Jay Malinowski is viewing the release of Bright Lights And Bruises, his first foray into the solo world outside of the cozy confines of his popular band Bedouin Soundclash. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m cleaning my side of the street before going back to work,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Malinowski of the 13-track soul purging recording while on a rare hiatus from his Juno award-winning day job. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThese are songs of things I lost along the way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The self-produced acoustic-based album, which will be released on BedouinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own PirateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blend Record label and distributed through Sony Music in Canada, February 16, 2010, shows off a different side of the artist -- quieter, deeply personal and incredibly contemplative, it is a sound befitting the catharsis he so urgently required. Bright Lights &amp; Bruises is a stunning and remarkably stirring collection of material that shows someone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as much in touch with his feelings as he is with the craft of songwriting, and someone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s willing to take chances and lay it all on the line. From the haunting and plaintive piano ballad ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Light -- the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s opener and first single -- to country strummers Life Is A Gun and Loving Hand, and the jangly, McCartney-esque pastoral melodicism of A Vacant Youth, Malinowski explores sonic and emotional spaces that will surprise but allure fans old and new.\n\ncd ripped by someone else using X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/jay-malinowski/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dec9545f0de4d1f6acb751c4a90d98f373925d8","amp;dn":"Jay+Malinowski...Bright+Lights+%26amp%3B+Bruises%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dec9545f0de4d1f6acb751c4a90d98f373925d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,236,149,69,240,222,77,31,106,203,117,28,74,144,217,143,55,57,37,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
