Johnny Morrison (Alan Ladd) returns from the war to find his wife Helen (Doris Dowling) having a party and in the arms of another man. Johnny and Helen have a terrible fight, and later Helen is found dead. Johnny must prove his innocence and he enlists the aid of Joyce Haywood (Veronica Lake), the ex-wife of Helen's lover. Pursued by the cops, and never sure if he is being set-up for the murder, Johnny finally solves the murder and clears his name. Alan Ladd is at his hard-boiled, no-nonsense best as Johnny and Veronica Lake is, as always, the perfect noir femme-fatale, mysterious and alluring. Nicely directed by George Marshall, the film moves with great pace to an exciting, satisfying conclusion. The screenplay, the only one written by Chandler directly for the screen, was nominated for an Academy Award.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img187.imageshack.us/img187/4756/bluedahlia03.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img187.imageshack.us/img187/4756/bluedahlia03.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/6263/bluedahlia03a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/6263/bluedahlia03a.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/7222/shadows01.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/7222/shadows01.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------not my rip--------\n\n~~~~~~ The Blue Dahlia.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,424,338,666                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:35:24                \nFrame Count:....................................143082             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................496                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.290                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1786                 \n......MPEG-4..............................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.225&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\n**************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
