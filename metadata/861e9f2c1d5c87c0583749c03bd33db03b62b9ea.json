Equal parts joke and subversive polemic, the work slices and dices the Queen, &quot;Tubthumping,&quot; the Sex Pistols, the Spice Girls, the M*A*S*H theme, Chic, George Bush, Gore Vidal, Noam Chomsky, Sesame Street and Alexander Berkman's 1929 publication ABC Of Anarchism. Further infringement strategies come in the form of The Weatherman's &quot;(c) Is For Stupid&quot; remix. If you need a product that represents your belief in freedom and humour, this is what you want, what you really, really want.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861e9f2c1d5c87c0583749c03bd33db03b62b9ea","amp;dn":"Negativland+and+Chumbawamba-ABCs+of+Anarchy+EP+%28VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861e9f2c1d5c87c0583749c03bd33db03b62b9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,30,159,44,29,92,135,192,88,55,73,192,59,211,61,176,59,98,185,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
