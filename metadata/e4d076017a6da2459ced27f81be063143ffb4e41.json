While I did release an AVCHD 720p version all the footage was upconverted from SD.\n\nWith the Blu-Ray release and even more tinkering by Lucas I decided to revisit this edit and do a proper HD version. Utilizing the Blu-Ray release as the main source, and Harmy's 720p version of the Despecialized Edition, I am happy to announce the release of Return of the Jedi: Q2 Edition - Remastered.\n\nCuts and Additions:\nI've left the special edition mostly intact, and have only changed the most grievous of alterations to the Blu-Ray release. Anything that is restored from the theatrical cut comes from an upconverted 720p version (which may in-turn been upconverted from SD though, I'm not sure). Because of this, the theatrical footage doesn't look quite as crisp as the BR source.\n\n- restored original Jabba's palace door\n- replaced &quot;Jedi Rock&quot; with the original dance number from the theatrical cut\n- removed subtitle &quot;I want fifty thousand. No less.&quot; C-3PO translates this immediately after, so it felt redundant.\n- cut burps from giant toad and Sarlacc pit\n- restored all shots of the theatrical beakless Sarlacc pit\n- restored Solo's original line &quot;Trust me!&quot; at the Sarlacc pit\n- removed Vaders &quot;No. Noooooo!&quot;\n- while I left the new galaxy-wide celebration intact, I did cut &quot;We'sa free!&quot; and restored the older Anakin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4d076017a6da2459ced27f81be063143ffb4e41","amp;dn":"Fall+of+the+Jedi%3A+Episode+6+-+Return+of+the+Jedi+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4d076017a6da2459ced27f81be063143ffb4e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,208,118,1,122,109,162,69,156,237,39,248,27,224,99,20,63,251,78,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
