The feeling is one of improvised (though well-conceived) pieces that build up from initial drones to multi-layered ragas built around the same initial patterns. Their strong debts to both Indian music and contemporary experimental/minimalist compositions are evident. It's not accessible enough for the average rock (or even average progressive rock) listener. But it's certainly more geared toward the adventurous rock listener than the most challenging and/or difficult contemporary avant-garde music. \n\nAll Apple Lossless (ALAC) (average 850kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8102cbbdc0a16c8f33e9081b2fc405421403b1af","amp;dn":"Third+Ear+Band+-+Self-Titled+%28Elements%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8102cbbdc0a16c8f33e9081b2fc405421403b1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,2,203,189,192,161,108,143,51,233,8,27,47,196,5,66,20,3,177,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
