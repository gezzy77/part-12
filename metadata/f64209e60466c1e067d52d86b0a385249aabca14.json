They can engage in combat with other starfighters to protect traders or engage in piracy themselves. They can also visit planets and space stations to look for jobs and to engage in commodity trade. The single-player story ties up the player, in the role of Edison Trent, in a series of missions to save the Sirius sector from a mysterious alien force. As the story progresses, restrictions on player activity are gradually released, and total freedom is granted at the story&amp;#039;s completion.\n\nGAMESPOT REVIEW: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/freelancer/index.html?tag=result;title;0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/freelancer/index.html?tag=result;title;0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTORRENT FOLDER CONTAINS:\nCD Image\nCrack Fixed/EXE\nInstall Read Me!\n\nSIZE:\n592 MB\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64209e60466c1e067d52d86b0a385249aabca14","amp;dn":"FreeLancer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64209e60466c1e067d52d86b0a385249aabca14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,66,9,230,4,102,193,224,103,213,45,134,176,163,133,36,154,171,202,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
