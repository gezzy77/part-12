The Daniel Project puts these prophecies under a journalistic microscope, discovering that many appear to have already come to pass.\n\nWritings by the prophet Daniel claim to predict - with uncanny accuracy - the Big Brother surveillance society, climate change, terrorism, and the rise of conflict within the Middle East.\n\nKnown as &quot;the real Nostradamus&quot;, Daniel's take on his future, our present, is like the musings of a rollercoaster Dan Brown novel - the dark implication being that what we perceive to be the truth is in fact masking a deadly pattern beneath.\n\nAs science continues to reveal the complexity of the world in which we live, there are those that claim we are not alone in this universe, and that compelling evidence is unfolding before our very eyes that clearly indicate mankind is about to meet his final destiny.\n\nMany years of research and five years in the making, &quot;The Daniel Project&quot; is a gripping documentary for our time. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae16772241e31940903828a9b1c5e2c6823f71a","amp;dn":"The+Daniel+Project+-+Prophecy%2C+Big+Brother%2C+Terrorism%2C+Jews","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae16772241e31940903828a9b1c5e2c6823f71a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,225,103,114,36,30,49,148,9,3,130,138,155,28,94,44,104,35,247,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
