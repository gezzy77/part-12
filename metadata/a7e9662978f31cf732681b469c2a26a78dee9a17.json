They slither, swim, walk and crawl, leap and lunge, and some spend their entire lives contained within a shell. Their ranks include some of the most skillful predators on Earth. And their long-departed dinosaur ancestors are an unending source of fascination to humanity, both in fiction and scientific endeavor. They are &amp;#039;The Reptiles,&amp;#039; the fascinating subjects of a four-part NATURE miniseries.&quot; \n\nPart 3 - Turtles and Tortoises \n\n&quot;Turtles and Tortoises&quot; takes a close look at ancient creatures marching slowly through the millennia. A turtle&amp;#039;s shell is among the most peculiar but successful pieces of design in the natural world. Unchanged for 200 million years, it has allowed the various species of turtles to populate almost everywhere in the world. But the limitations of life in a shell are causing turtles problems in today&amp;#039;s world. Overexploitation by humans has caused many turtle species to become extinct or endangered. This episode introduces some inspirational people who are trying to help them. \n\nmore info: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/reptiles/ \n\n== \nRuntime: 53mins \nSource: OTA High Definition 1080i \nEncoding: xvid.928x528.1706kbps.mp3.160.vbr \nFile Size: 700MB \n\nFederal funding for CPB/PBS is going to be cut significantly over the next two years, so if you watch any of these programs, please support your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs.
