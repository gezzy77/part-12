After the first demo was released some line-up changes took place, which leads us to the current line-up. They recorded their debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnlightenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and changed their name to Sleeping Romance, and after that a deal was inked with the Swedish label Ulterium Records. \n\nFederico Truzzi recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnlightenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the Lemonhead Studio and then the album was mastered by Roberto Priori [Los Angeles, Danger Zone, Vision Divine] at Pristudio. The incredible artwork was created by Felipe Machado Franco [Blind Guardian, Rhapsody of Fire] who really managed to capture the vibe of the album. \n\nThe band describes the concept for Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnlightenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a travel into the human soul who is crashing into the world: fighting, loving and to be born againÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\nFronted by the emotional vocals of Federica Lanna and the epic songwriting from guitar player Federico Truzzi, Sleeping Romance creates something really exciting together that should appeal to fans in the scene. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss out on Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnlightenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½! \n\nSleeping Romance supported Theocracy on their European tour in November 2013.\ncredits\nreleased 30 December 2013\n\n(Not my torrent, just helping to spread the good metal.
