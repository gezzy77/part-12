Dyson. Like artists and poets, they are free spirits who resist the restrictions their cultures impose on them. In their pursuit of nature's truths, they are guided as much by imagination as by reason, and their greatest theories have the uniqueness and beauty of great works of art.Dyson argues that the best way to understand science is by understanding those who practice it. He tells stories of scientists at work, ranging from Isaac Newton's absorption in physics, alchemy, theology, and politics, to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the structure of the atom, to Albert Einstein's stubborn hostility to the idea of black holes. His descriptions of brilliant physicists like Edward Teller and Richard Feynman are enlivened by his own reminiscences of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68362e2cf77787976c65a396c3d159dfa0bcdd7","amp;dn":"The+Scientist+as+Rebel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68362e2cf77787976c65a396c3d159dfa0bcdd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,131,98,226,207,119,120,121,118,198,90,57,108,61,21,157,250,11,205,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
