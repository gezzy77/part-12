Â \r\n\r\nEven decades after their arrival, Corrine and Russell Calloway still feel as if theyâ€™re living the dream that drew them to New York City in the first place: book parties or art openings one night and high-society events the next; jobs they care about (and in fact love); twin children whose birth was truly miraculous; a loft in TriBeCa and summers in the Hamptons. But all of this comes at a fiendish cost. Russell, an independent publisher, has superb cultural credentials yet minimal cash flow; as he navigates a business that requires, beyond astute literary judgment, constant financial improvisation, he encounters an audacious, potentially game-changingâ€”or ruinousâ€”opportunity. Meanwhile, instead of chasing personal gain in this incredibly wealthy city, Corrine devotes herself to helping feed its hungry poor, and she and her husband soon discover theyâ€™re being priced out of the newly fashionable neighborhood theyâ€™ve called home for most of their adult lives, with their son and daughter caught in the balance.\r\n\r\nThen Corrineâ€™s world is turned upside down when the man with whom sheâ€™d had an ill-fated affair in the wake of 9/11 suddenly reappears. As the novel unfolds across a period of stupendous changeâ€”including Obamaâ€™s historic election and the global economic collapse he inheritedâ€”the Calloways will find themselves and their marriage tested more severely than they ever could have imagined","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbed746121e44851bb29bc50050f1ceb70ef217a","amp;dn":"Bright%2C+Precious+Days+-+Jay+McInerney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbed746121e44851bb29bc50050f1ceb70ef217a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,237,116,97,33,228,72,81,187,41,188,80,5,15,28,235,112,239,33,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
