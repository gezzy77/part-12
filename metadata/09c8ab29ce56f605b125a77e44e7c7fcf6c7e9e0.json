Then we'll discuss the UI and break it down to make it easier to understand. After that we'll start working in the editor by learning how to navigate the viewports, place objects in the level, manipulate those objects, along with several other helpful techniques for working in the level editor. \n\nFrom there we'll break out into some of the other commonly used editors like the Materials editor, blueprint editor and matinee editor. After we've laid a solid foundation, we'll jump into a quick project to solidify what we have learned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c8ab29ce56f605b125a77e44e7c7fcf6c7e9e0","amp;dn":"Your+First+Day+in+Unreal+Engine+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c8ab29ce56f605b125a77e44e7c7fcf6c7e9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,200,171,41,206,86,246,5,177,37,167,126,68,231,199,252,246,199,233,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
