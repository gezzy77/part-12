It pulls no punches, and shows the violence and senselessness of war, in start black and white that almost grates the soul to read. I added this book to my recommended euro books list even before I was halfway done editing it.\nIf you want a book about war that glorifies war, and show heroic acts, and are semi propaganga, this is NOT a book for you. If you want a book that shows why mankind should NOT wage war, this is the essential comic for it.\n\nWorld War I, that awful, gaping wound in the history of Europe, has long been an obsession of Jacques Tardis. But It Was the War of the Trenches is Tardis defining, masterful statement on the subject, a graphic novel that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Erich Maria Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front and Ernest Hemingways A Farewell to Arms.\n\nTardi is not interested in the national politics, the strategies, or the battles. Like Remarque, he focuses on the day to day of the grunts in the trenches, and, with icy, controlled fury and disgust, with sardonic yet deeply sympathetic narration, he brings that existence alive as no one has before or since. Yet he also delves deeply into the underlying causes of the war, the madness, the cynical political exploitation of patriotism. And in a final, heartbreaking coda, Tardi grimly itemizes the ghastly human cost of the war, and lays out the future 20th century conflicts, all of which seem to spring from this global burst of insanity.\n\nTrenches features some of Tardis most stunning artwork. Rendered in an inhabitually lush illustrative style, inspired both by abundant photographic documentation and classic American war comics, augmented by a sophisticated, gorgeous use of Craftint tones, trenches is somehow simultaneously atypical and a perfect encapsulation of TardiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mature style. It is the indisputable centerpiece of Tardis oeuvre. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/387/itwasthewarofthetrenche.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1eed0204d22e1551b4029398fc256035119dc2f","amp;dn":"It+was+the+War+of+the+Trenches+%28Batmanatee+Begins-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1eed0204d22e1551b4029398fc256035119dc2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,238,208,32,77,34,225,85,27,64,41,57,143,194,86,3,81,25,220,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
