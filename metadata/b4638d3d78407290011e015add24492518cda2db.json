He and Emaline have been together all through high school in Colby, the beach town where they both grew up. But now, in the summer before college, Emaline wonders if perfect is good enough.\n\nEnter Theo, a super-ambitious outsider, a New Yorker assisting on a documentary film about a reclusive local artist. Theo's sophisticated, exciting, and, best of all, he thinks Emaline is much too smart for Colby.\n\nEmaline's mostly-absentee father, too, thinks Emaline should have a bigger life, and he's convinced that an Ivy League education is the only route to realizing her potential. Emaline is attracted to the bright future that Theo and her father promise. But she also clings to the deep roots of her loving mother, stepfather, and sisters. Can she ignore the pull of the happily familiar world of Colby?\n\nEmaline wants the moon and more, but how can she balance where she comes from with where she's going?\n\nSarah Dessen's devoted fans will welcome this story of romance, yearning, and, finally, empowerment. It could only happen in the summer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4638d3d78407290011e015add24492518cda2db","amp;dn":"The+Moon+and+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4638d3d78407290011e015add24492518cda2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,99,141,61,120,64,114,144,1,30,1,90,221,36,73,37,24,205,162,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
