He is sent to RÃƒÂ©surrection after his death and is attacked by a mob of zombies. During the confrontation he meets a vampire who calls himself Otto von Todt and befriends him. Otto reveals he is a vampire and explains that now Heinrich has become a vampire as well. As the story progresses, the hero discovers the world of RÃƒÂ©surrection, its peoples and politics. He is however only interested in retrieving a woman he loved during his lifetime and who he knows by the name of Rebecca.\n\nThis is part 2. I hope you all enjoy. In this part at the Battle of the twenty-third century in London that materialized on Resurrection, a monster gathering all existing diseases is freed to fight the vampires. His features are reminiscent of King Kong. Moreover, the monster is shown, in some way, at the top of Big Ben (as King Kong on the Empire State Building) fighting off a swarm of flying machines controlled by vampires and bombarding it with bullets.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr&quot; files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other translated Belgian/French comics, you can check my release thread:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced.
