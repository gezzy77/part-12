Sure, HTML started as a mere markup language, but more recently HTMLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s put on some major muscle. Now weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a language tuned for building web applications with Web storage, 2D drawing, offline support, sockets and threads, and more. And to speak this language youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got to go beyond HTML5 markup and into the world of the DOM, events, and JavaScript APIs.\n\nNow you probably already know all about HTML markup (otherwise known as structure) and you know all aboutCSS style (presentation), but what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been missing is JavaScript (behavior). If all you know about are structure and presentation, you can create some great looking pages, but theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still just pages. When you add behavior with JavaScript, you can create an interactive experience; even better, you can create full blown web applications.\n\nHead First HTML5 Programming is your ultimate tour guide to creating web applications with HTML5 and JavaScript, and we give you everything you need to know to build them, including: how to add interactivity to your pages, how to communicate with the world of Web services, and how to use the great new APIs being developed for HTML5.\n\nHere are just some of the things youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn in Head First HTML5 Programing:\nLearn how to make your pages truly interactive by using the power of the DOM.\nFinally understand how JavaScript works and take yourself from novice to well-informed in just a few chapters.\nLearn how JavaScript APIs fit into the HTML5 ecosystem, and how to use any API in your web pages.\nUse the Geolocation API to know where your users are.\nBring out your inner artist with Canvas, HTML5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new 2D drawing surface.\nGo beyond just plugging a video into your pages, and create custom video experiences.\nLearn the secret to grabbing five megabytes of storage in every userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s browser.\nImprove your pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s responsiveness and performance with Web workers.\nAnd much more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1cdb35771bc4b6b826eb4c4b202d543a167410","amp;dn":"Head+First+HTML5+Programming+-+Building+Web+Apps+with+JavaScript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1cdb35771bc4b6b826eb4c4b202d543a167410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,28,219,53,119,27,196,182,184,38,235,76,75,32,45,84,58,22,116,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
