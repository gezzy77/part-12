He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriter partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.\n\nIn his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300 million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 Billboard Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2000) he had at least one song in the Billboard Hot 100. He has the most No. 1 hits on US Adult Contemporary Chart (16 No. 1's).[His single &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;/&quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is &quot;the best-selling single of all time&quot;. He has received six Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legend award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him Number 49 on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2008, Billboard ranked him the most successful male solo artist on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot; (third overall).\n\nElton John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Having been named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996, John received a knighthood from Elizabeth II for &quot;services to music and charitable services&quot; in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.\n\nHe has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over $200 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005 and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements worldwide and same-sex marriage.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMadman Across the Water is the fourth studio album by British singer/songwriter Elton John, released in 1971 through DJM/Uni Records.\n\nJohn, Johnstone, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson, who would be the main musicians on the next album (Honky Chateau), would soon join with percussionist Ray Cooper and form the best-known line-up of his mid-1970s band. As with all John songs during this period, the lyrics were penned by his writing partner, Bernie Taupin. This was the last album to be recorded at London's Trident Studios. They relocated to ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'HÃƒÂ©rouville for the next three albums. Caleb Quaye and Roger Pope wouldn't play with John again until Rock of the Westies in 1975, following Murray and Olsson's departure from the band.\n\nUpon its release, Madman Across the Water was almost ignored in John's homeland, barely reaching #41 on the UK Albums Chart and spending only two weeks there. It has been the lowest-charting album of his career to date. The album fared better in North America, peaking at #8 on the U.S. Billboard Top Pop Albums and placing at #10 on the year-end list of 1972. It received Gold by the RIAA in February 1972, achieving $1 million in sales at wholesale value just in the United States. In 1998, the album was certified Multi-Platinum, representing shipments of over 2 million units in the U.S.\n\nThe title song was set to be released on John's previous album Tumbleweed Connection. However, it was set aside and would eventually be re-recorded and serve as the title track of this album. Previous versions of the song (from the Tumbleweed sessions with Mick Ronson on guitar) can still be found, specifically on the remastered Tumbleweed Connection CD.\n\nWhen it was released in 'The Classic Years' collection, it was the first album not to feature any bonus tracks. One known track recorded at the time, &quot;Rock Me when He's Gone,&quot; was released on Rare Masters a few years before. The song was written for and recorded by one of John's long-time friends, Long John Baldry. This was John's first album in which he plays his piano and no other keyboards. This was the first album in which Davey Johnstone played guitar for John, a role that would continue for decades.\n\nThe song &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was written for Adam Diaz. An additional verse in the recorded version that was originally part of the song was either omitted during recording or edited out of the final album version. It can, however, be heard on &quot;unofficial&quot; live recordings of the song from some of his concerts during this period, which have circulated among collectors.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nElton John: Piano, Vocals\n\nRoger Pope: Drums (Tracks 1, 3 &amp; 6)\n\nDavid Glover: Bass guitar (Tracks 1, 3 &amp; 6)\n\nCaleb Quaye: Electric guitar (Tracks 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3), Acoustic guitar (Track 6)\n\nBJ Cole: Steel guitar (Track 1)\n\nDavey Johnstone: Acoustic guitar (Tracks 1, 4 &amp; 7), Mandolin (Track 6), Sitar (Track 6)\n\nLesley Duncan, Sue &amp; Sunny, Barry St. John, Liza Strike, Roger Cook, Tony Burrows, Terry Steele, Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson: Backing vocals (Tracks 1, 6 &amp; 7)\n\nPaul Buckmaster: Arrangement (Tracks 1, 2, 4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6, 8 &amp; 9)\n\nBarry Morgan: Drums (Track 2)\n\nBrian Odgers: Bass guitar (Track 2)\n\nBrian Dee: Harmonium (Track 2)\n\nRick Wakeman: Organ (Tracks 3, 4 &amp; 7)\n\nJack Emblow: Accordion (Track 3)\n\nTerry Cox: Drums (Tracks 4, 5 &amp; 7)\n\nHerbie Flowers: Bass guitar (Madman Tracks 4, 5 &amp; 7)\n\nRay Cooper: Percussion (Track 4), Tambourine (Tracks 7 &amp; 8)\n\nChris Spedding: Electric guitar (Track 4), Slide guitar (Track 7)\n\nDiana Lewis: ARP Synthesiser (Tracks 4 &amp; 7)\n\nChris Laurence: Double bass (Track 5)\n\nCantores em Ecclesia Choir: Backing vocals (Tracks 5 &amp; 8)\n\nNigel Olsson: Drums (Track 8)\n\nDee Murray: Bass guitar (Track 8)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e69c939315fbd6f6bf54496e860303821fd8f20d","amp;dn":"Elton+John%2FMadman+Across+The+Water%5B1971%5D%5B1995%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e69c939315fbd6f6bf54496e860303821fd8f20d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,156,147,147,21,251,214,246,191,84,73,110,134,3,3,130,31,216,242,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
