Himself                                        \n\nComedian Bill Maher's Tony Award-nominated Broadway standup show,      \nBill Maher: Victory Begins at Home, will return to New York, July      \n17-19, 2003. The final performance at the Hudson Theatre (which is     \nnot technically a Broadway house though it's in the midtown theatre   \ndistrict) will be filmed live for HBO. In the show, Maher addresses     \ncontemporary political, social and cultural topics -- Iraq, President   \nBush and the so called Axis of Evil. The opinionated Maher said about   \nVictory Begins at Home: &quot;We've heard everything about the War on        \nTerrorism except what we can actually do to help win it. The           \ngovernment used to do that for us through propaganda (the positive     \nkind) posters, so taking my cue from the great old posters of World     \nWar I and World War II ('Loose Lips Sink Ships,' 'Buy War Bonds,'       \n'Plant a Victory Garden,' etc.) I commissioned artists to paint the    \nposters our government today should be putting out to help us win    \nthis war.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a86891c701015398519ce0bba3e970579130fe","amp;dn":"Bill+Maher+-+Victory+Begins+At+Home+%282003%29+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a86891c701015398519ce0bba3e970579130fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,168,104,145,199,1,1,83,152,81,156,224,187,163,233,112,87,145,48,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
