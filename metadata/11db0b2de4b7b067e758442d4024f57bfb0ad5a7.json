Stewart may have chosen to cater to the pop\nand disco crowd of the 80s, but back in the early seventies he was perhaps the very best interpreter of\nfolk, blues and country that the United Kingdom had to offer, and the team of Rod Stewart and Ronnie\nWood turned out some of the best folk/rock albums of all time.\n\nThis is definitely NOT where you go to get &quot;Baby Jane&quot;, &quot;Some Guys Have All The Luck&quot; or\n&quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy&quot;, no, this is the very best of Rod Stewart's first six studio albums under his\nown name, back when he was a young singer/songwriter with a musical vision that didn't include pink\noutfits, spiky hair and lots and lots of synth.\nJust listen to his interpretations of &quot;Country Comforts&quot; and &quot;Mama You've Been On My Mind&quot;, or the\nStewart Wood originals &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; and &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot;. Or his own compositions\n[why doesn't he write and compose his own songs anymore ?], like &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and the beautiful\n&quot;Mandolin Wind&quot;.\n\nThis is how Rod Stewart should be remembered, as a first-rate interpreter and a great songwriter who\nknew and understood the origins of the music he played without being weighed down by it.\n\n\n\n\n  01 - Every Picture Tells A Story               [05:59]\n  02 - [Interludings]                            [00:40]\n  03 - You Wear It Well                          [04:22]\n  04 - You Put Something Better Inside Of Me     [03:49]\n  05 - Only A Hobo                               [04:19]\n  06 - Reason To Believe                         [04:07]\n  07 - Its All Over Now [Single Version]         [03:36]\n  08 - Cut Across Shorty                         [06:33]\n  09 - Lost Paraguayos                           [03:59]\n  10 - Mandolin Wind                             [05:31]\n  11 - Crying Laughing Loving Lying              [02:52]\n  12 - Street Fighting Man                       [05:06]\n  13 - Man Of Constant Sorrow                    [02:33]\n  14 - [I Know] Im Losing You                    [05:21]\n  15 - Lady Day                                  [04:05]\n  16 - So Tired                                  [03:41]\n  17 - Oh No Not My Baby                         [03:38]\n  18 - What Made Milwaukee Famous                [02:55]\n  19 - Handbags And Gladrags                     [04:24]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:17:35\nTotal Size...........: 478.73 MB\n\n\n\n  01 - Henry                                     [00:32]\n  02 - Maggie May                                [05:15]\n  03 - Gasoline Alley                            [04:05]\n  04 - Dixie Toot                                [03:28]\n  05 - Every Time We Say Goodbye                 [03:34]\n  06 - Twsitin The Night Away [Original Version] [03:16]\n  07 - True Blue                                 [03:33]\n  08 - Lochinvar                                 [00:24]\n  09 - Farewell                                  [04:34]\n  10 - Italian Girls                             [04:58]\n  11 - Mama You Been On My Mind                  [04:30]\n  12 - Country Comfort                           [04:44]\n  13 - I Wouldnt Change A Thing                  [04:46]\n  14 - Id Rather Go Blind                        [03:53]\n  15 - Angel                                     [04:05]\n  16 - Mised You                                 [03:59]\n  17 - Dirty Old Town                            [03:41]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 01:03:23\nTotal Size...........: 399.53 MB\n\n\n\n\nRipper.......: EAC V0.99 prebeta 5, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC - 8 - oan\n\nCodec........: Free Lossless Audio Codec [FLAC]\n\nVersion......: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nQuality......: Lossless, [avg. compression: 51 %]\n\nChannels.....: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nTags.........: VorbisComment\n\nScand Artwork.........: @ 600dpi\n\nTraders Little Helper....: checksum Files .ffp &amp; .md5\n\nLyrics....: No .lol\n\nTorrent Pieces....: 14138 x 64 kb\n\n\nRipped by....: (oan) on 08/12/2011\n\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 26/12/2011\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/442d/726b15d4.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11db0b2de4b7b067e758442d4024f57bfb0ad5a7","amp;dn":"Rod+Stewart+-+Handbags+n+Gladrags+1995+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11db0b2de4b7b067e758442d4024f57bfb0ad5a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,219,11,45,228,183,176,103,231,88,68,45,64,36,245,123,251,10,213,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
