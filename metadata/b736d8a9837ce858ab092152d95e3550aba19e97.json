The 12 revised full papers presented together with 2 invited lectures were carefully selected from a total of 45 submissions to both events. The workshops' thematic focus is on collaborative and autonomous agents that plan, negotiate, coordinate, and act under conditions of incomplete information, uncertainty, and bounded rationality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b736d8a9837ce858ab092152d95e3550aba19e97","amp;dn":"Collaborative+Agents+-+Research+and+Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b736d8a9837ce858ab092152d95e3550aba19e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,54,216,169,131,124,232,88,171,9,33,82,217,94,53,80,171,161,158,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
