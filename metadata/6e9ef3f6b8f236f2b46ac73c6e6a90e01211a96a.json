Author Sheila Rogers discusses categories of tics including spasmodic facial movements, eye blinking, mild sounds, and humming. She persuasively counters the medical establishmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard claim that such disorders are Ã¢â‚¬Å“mysteriousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and based in genetics. The dramatic spike in cases, she argues, belies this explanation. Natural Treatments for Tics and TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s takes a closer look at the environmental factors and underlying physical imbalances that trigger these conditionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ symptoms. In this second edition to Tics and Tourette's: Breakthrough Discoveries in NaturalTreatments, Rogers offers a detailed natural treatment plan. No more will patients have to rely on traditional, drug-based treatments that often carry multiple side effects. In eight sections, the book offers advice from medical experts, the latest reports in medical research, a checklist of common tic triggers, inspirational stories from families who have successfully conquered tics and TouretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and practical worksheets for readers to use in their treatment and research. Each of the 23 chapters includes a place for notes and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Takeaway TipsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ summarizing key points.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9ef3f6b8f236f2b46ac73c6e6a90e01211a96a","amp;dn":"Natural+Treatments+for+Tics+and+Tourette%27s+-+Sheila+J.+Rogers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9ef3f6b8f236f2b46ac73c6e6a90e01211a96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,158,243,246,184,242,54,242,180,106,199,60,110,106,144,224,18,17,169,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
