But Hadley was only one of four women married, in turn, to the legendary writer. Just as T.C. BoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestseller The Women completed the picture begun by Nancy HoranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Loving Frank, Naomi WoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mrs. Hemingway tells the story of how it was to love, and be loved by, the most famous and dashing writer of his generation. Hadley, Pauline, Martha and Mary: each Mrs. Hemingway thought their love would last forever; each one was wrong.\n\nTold in four parts and based on real love letters and telegrams, Mrs. Hemingway reveals the explosive love triangles that wrecked each of Hemingway's marriages. Spanning 1920s bohemian Paris through 1960s Cold War America, populated with members of the fabled &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; Mrs. Heminway is a riveting tale of passion, love, and heartbreak.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be7eb8ae22b677b2cdd509d23b9bc9c3991c84b","amp;dn":"Mrs.+Hemingway+-+Naomi+Wood.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be7eb8ae22b677b2cdd509d23b9bc9c3991c84b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,231,235,138,226,43,103,123,44,221,80,157,35,185,188,156,57,145,200,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
