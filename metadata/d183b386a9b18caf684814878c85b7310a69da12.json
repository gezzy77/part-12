Rush had the misfortune to be equated with Bob Dylan, but he had a more easygoing and accessible personality that comes out on numbers here such as Woody Guthrie's &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; and Kokomo Arnold's &quot;Milkcow Blues,&quot; which are thoroughly enjoyable and quietly (but totally) beguiling. Additionally, he isn't such a purist that he felt above covering a Leiber &amp; Stoller number such as &quot;When She Wants Good Lovin'.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d183b386a9b18caf684814878c85b7310a69da12","amp;dn":"Tom+Rush+-+1965","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d183b386a9b18caf684814878c85b7310a69da12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,131,179,134,169,177,140,175,104,72,20,135,140,133,183,49,10,105,218,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
