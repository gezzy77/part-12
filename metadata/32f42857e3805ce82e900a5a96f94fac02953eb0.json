Actually I bought but on the contract it says I only owned a license to live at .. sure I didn't read the contract. My house's license expired 3 hours ago because you know.. a famous Wall street lawyer told me so. \n\n\nYear: 2012 \nGenre: All genres \nDeveloper: Nintendo and others. \nPublisher: Nintendo \nLanguage: Anliysky, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, etc. \nConsole: Nintendo 64 \nDescription: The newest Good-Rom Set for Nintendo 64 version GoodN64 3.21, today.

Info: \nDifferences between sets. \nCompilations Good - designed for collectors, they have everything - formal and informal games, hacks, prototypes, beta and TP. Court also includes No-Intro collections and collections of Russian versions of games, that is, as some say - &quot;garbage collectors&quot;, although I fundamentally disagree with that, because I am a collector. Many do this collection of separate distribution. \nCollections No-Intro - those in which only good dumps, no hacks, prototypes and etc., ie, the original versions of the various countries USA, EUR, JAP and etc., dump as close to the official release of the license kartridzham.Tolko igry.Napominayu they are in collections from Good sets. \nCompilations NonGood - all roms not included in Good sets, they are usually harvested like us fans and fans of the consoles in order to expand its collection Ryskov on an Internet search for new dumps and all the possible new Roma - later this fall collections in the new version of the Good set .\n\nFrom myself - dear fans clone distribution, treat carefully to the differences between sets! If you do No-Intro - for example, make it clean without additional folders with the same hacks and prototypes, what's the point? Good set - renamed the No-Intro - I often zamechayu.Est lovers rename ROMs, stick to the standards. Meaning that the right to rename the rum is named, it is convenient for you, for collectors - this is a normal set and you renamed, and then to understand some of the dumps right.\n\nATTENTION !!! It is interesting! \n- Number of files 414 pcs \n- Number of Rom 3389 pcs \n- The size of the Rom unpacked 44.9 gigabytes \n- Before starting the emulator should unpack Rom!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32f42857e3805ce82e900a5a96f94fac02953eb0","amp;dn":"Good64+3.21+%5Bcomplete+rom+set%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32f42857e3805ce82e900a5a96f94fac02953eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,244,40,87,227,128,92,232,46,144,10,90,150,249,79,172,2,149,62,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
