Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a multi-platinum double album\nproduced by George Martin, featuring covers of songs by The Beatles. It was\nreleased in July 1978, as the soundtrack to the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely\nHearts Club Band, which starred the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and Steve\nMartin.\n\nThe project was managed by The Robert Stigwood Organisation. In 1975 the\noriginal plans for the album were suspended due to a dispute between\nColumbia and RSO. RSO invested $12 million into this soundtrack and the profit\noffset set against costs such as $1 million for promotion.\n\nAlthough Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band debuted at #5 in the U.S.\nBillboard album charts and stayed there for six weeks, becoming a multi-\nplatinum album, there was reported resistance to the interpretation of The\nBeatles' songs, such as Martin's comedic take on &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;.\nHowever Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's version of &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; became\na million selling single and Aerosmith's &quot;Come Together&quot; charted in the top 40\nand later appeared on the soundtrack for Armageddon.\n\nRadio airplay trailed off when the film was released with poor reviews, only\nfive weeks later. The album immediately dropped out of the top 100 and\npre-sale shipments to USA failed to sell in the quantities predicted. Owing to\nlow box office receipts the film failed to make back its production costs, but\nprofits from the soundtrack album and the successful singles it spawned later\ncovered those losses.\n\n320 bit rate MP3\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc 1\n\n01 Introducing Sgt.
