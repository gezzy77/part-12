The name originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was widely disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax, and may have been written by a journalist in a deliberate attempt to heighten interest in the story. Within the crime case files as well as journalistic accounts the killer was known as &quot;the Whitechapel Murderer&quot; as well as &quot;Leather Apron&quot;.\n\nAttacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of London and whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer possessed anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and letters from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer were received by media outlets and Scotland Yard. The &quot;From Hell&quot; letter, received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, included half of a preserved human kidney, supposedly from one of the victims. Mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events, the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;.\n\nExtensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper, and his legend solidified. An investigation into a series of eleven brutal killings in Whitechapel up to 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888. Five victims: Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly, all murdered between 31 August and 9 November 1888, are known as the &quot;canonical five&quot; and their murders are often considered the most likely to be linked. As the murders were never solved, the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, folklore, and pseudohistory. The term &quot;ripperology&quot; was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. There are now over one hundred theories about the Ripper's identity, and the murders have inspired multiple works of fiction.\n\n\nJack the Ripper Video List\n\n1978-10-12 - s03e05 - In Search Of - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 320x240, 864kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1980-09-17 - Documentary - Jack the Ripper - The Final Solution\n     (Video: 600x468, 858kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1988 - Secrets of the Unknown - Jack The Ripper\n     (Video: 720x480, 848kbps, 30fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1988-01-01 - The Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 1280x720, 1500kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 106kbps)\n\n1988-09-07 - s07e07 - Timewatch - Shadow of the Ripper\n     (Video: 352x288, 383kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1993-01-01 - Documentary - The Diary of Jack the Ripper - Beyond Reasonable Doubt\n     (Video: 1280x720, 1211kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1994-10-07 - s10e04 - History's Mysteries - The Hunt for Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 720x540, 768kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1995-08-23 - A and E Biography - Jack the Ripper - Phantom of Death\n     (Video: 496x360, 351kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n1996 - The White Chapel Murders\n     (Video: 470x360, 300kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2000 - Discovery Channel - Jack The Ripper - An On-going Mystery\n     (Video: 720x480, 1486kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 105kbps)\n\n2002 - Independent - Jack the Ripper Conspiracies\n     (Video: 472x360, 323kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2002 - Omnibus - Episode 1 - Jack the Ripper - Case Closed\n     (Video: 352x288, 251kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2004-04-05 - Bloody Britain - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 854, 640kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 122kbps)\n\n2006 - The History Channel - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 454x360, 386kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2006-10-30 - s02e11 - Is it Real - Jack The Ripper\n     (Video: 640x360, 1500kbps, 30fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2006-11-21 - s05e02 - Revealed - Jack the Ripper - The First Serial Killer\n     (Video: 1080x720, 1151kbps, 30fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2007 - Independent - Vic Reeves Investigates - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 608x336, 764kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 102kbps)\n\n2009-01-27 - s01e01 - America's Serial Killers - Portraits in Evil - The Monster Within And Among Us\n     (Video: 640x360, 323kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2009-06-24 - s08e01 - Revealed - Jack the Ripper - Tabloid Killer\n     (Video: 624x352, 762kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 107kbps)\n\n2009-11-11 - s01e08 - MysteryQuest - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 640x352, 501kbps, 23fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2010-02-01 - s01e02 - Mystery Files - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 640x360, 767kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2010-08-31 - Documentary - The Real Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 640x360, 496kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2011-01-11 - Miniseries - Jack The Ripper - The Definitive Story (1)\n     (Video: 640x360, 351kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2011-01-20 - Miniseries - Jack The Ripper - The Definitive Story (2)\n     (Video: 640x360, 350kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2011-04-03 - NatGeo Expedition Week - Finding Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 1280, 1892kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2012 - Independent - Finding the True Identity of Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 1280x720, 2197kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2012-05-09 - TDC Australia - Jack the Ripper - Prime Suspect\n     (Video: 1280x720, 1348kbps, 30fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 101kbps)\n\n2013 - Independent - Jack The Ripper - (Year Approx)\n     (Video: 1280x720, 1260kbps, 23fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2013-11-05 - s03e01 - Fred Dinenage - Murder Casebook - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 608x336, 315kbps, 25fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n2013-12-04 - s01e01 - Killer Contact - Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 720x404, 710kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n(Year Unknown) - Independent - Jack the Ripper and Whitechapel Walking Tour\n     (Video: 1280x720, 2850kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 121kbps)\n\n(Year Unknown) - Independent - Jack The Ripper Contradictions\n     (Video: 640x480, 539kbps, 29.97fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n\n(Year Unknown) - The Truth about Jack the Ripper\n     (Video: 848x480, 1986kbps, 30fps - Audio: 44.1kHz, 96kbps)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2a3711abdb45fb1fe56c1f05f805b24a246baf","amp;dn":"32+Different+Jack+the+Ripper+Documentaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2a3711abdb45fb1fe56c1f05f805b24a246baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,42,55,17,171,219,69,251,31,229,108,31,5,248,5,178,74,36,107,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
