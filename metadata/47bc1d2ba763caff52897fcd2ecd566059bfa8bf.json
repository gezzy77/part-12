When her father dies shortly after losing his horse farm to Duke Bradley (Gable), Carol Clayton (Harlow) refuses the handsome bookmaker's offer to forget the debt and instead vows to pay him back in full. She even forbids her stockbroker fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Harley Madison (Pidgeon), to make wagers that may benefit Duke, but promises to marry him once her champion horse wins at Saratoga. But against all the odds, Carol falls in love with Duke and when he appears in danger of ruination, she finds herself rooting for the competitor to win the all-important race. Saratoga, which was finished using both onscreen and voice doubles for Jean Harlow, was partially filmed on-location at Lexington and Louisville, KY, and in Saratoga Springs, NY. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029516/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029516/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-27382&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-27382&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:31:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x416 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1002 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 64 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47bc1d2ba763caff52897fcd2ecd566059bfa8bf","amp;dn":"Saratoga+Jean+Harlow+1937+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47bc1d2ba763caff52897fcd2ecd566059bfa8bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,188,29,43,167,99,202,255,82,137,127,205,46,205,86,96,89,191,168,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
