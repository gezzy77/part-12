A. Dupont. Olga Tschechowa plays the star dancer of Paris\\' famed Moulin Rouge nightspot. Her daughter Eve Gray is in love with impressionable Jean Bradin. Alas, Jean adores another - Eve\\'s own mother. A blessed relief from the usual turgid, slapped-together British films of the period, Moulin Rouge has visual moments that approach the brilliance of Dupont\\'s previous backstage melodrama, the German Variety. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nMoulin Rouge ranks among the best British-made films of the silent era, though it\\'s essentially a German film produced in England. German film-critic-turned-director E. A. Dupont and German set designer Alfred Junge provide the film with its outstanding visual flair. The star is the Armenian-born Olga Tschechova; French actors Georges TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ville and Marcel Vibert have key supporting roles, as does German-born actress Ellen Pollock. The resulting film supplied London studios with an influx of talent. Junge, in particular, became a mainstay in the films of Michael Powell. As with much of Dupont\\'s best work, the story is a sexually charged backstage melodrama, the kind which would all but vanish in the 1930s with the advent of the movie musical and increasingly restrictive censorship codes. ~ Richard Gilliam, All Movie Guide\n\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 1.493 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 128 kbps 44 KHz\nResolution: 640 x 480\nAspect Ratio: 1.333\nFormato de Tela: Tela Cheia (4x3)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nSize: 991.3 MiB\n\nIntertitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f439a67136992a869ffeb3997ecca4114aca6ef","amp;dn":"Moulin+Rouge+1928.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f439a67136992a869ffeb3997ecca4114aca6ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,67,154,103,19,105,146,168,105,255,235,57,151,236,202,65,20,172,166,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
