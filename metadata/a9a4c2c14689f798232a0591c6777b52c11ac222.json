Google planned to digitize, index, and display &quot;snippets&quot; of print books in the collections of five major libraries without the permission of the books' copyright holders, if any. This book examines the important issues that were raised by the outcome of the Google Library Project, and analyze possible future cases which may raise similar questions about infringing reproduction and fair use. The authors also discuss hyperlinking, in-line linking, caching, framing and thumbnails and how they relate to a copyright holder's traditional rights to control reproduction, display, and distribution of protected works. This book consists of public documents which have been located, gathered, combined, reformatted, and enhanced with a subject index, selectively edited and bound to provide easy access.\n\n===================================================================================\nTable of Contents:\nPreface pp. i-xi\nChapter 1.
