I enjoyed it, certainly. Technically it was outstanding. Casting was good, sets were outstanding, costumes were very nice.\n\nAs an adaptation of the books, however, this was horrendous. It was as if the writer had torn a quarter of the pages from the first three books, a few pages from books 4-9, and pasted them together in a random fashion to try and create a cohesive movie. Now, had I not read the books, I would have enjoyed this movie very much, so I have to give that to them, but as a fan, it was just a slap in the face.\n\nIf you've read the books, don't see the movie, it will just enrage you. If you haven't, see the movie. It'll be very enjoyable. If, however, you decide to read the books afterwards, be aware that they are far darker than the movie shows, and the mystery is certainly deeper than some magnifying glass in Count Olaf's house. Do not think of them as kid stuff.\n\n7.5/10 for the movie, 2/10 for the adaptation.\n\nAdditional Details\n\n\nAlso Known As:See more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»MPAA:Rated PG for thematic elements, scary situations and brief language.Parents Guide:View content advisory for parentsRuntime:108 min Country:USA | GermanyLanguage:EnglishColor:Black and White | Color Aspect Ratio:1.85 : 1 See more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»Sound Mix:Dolby Digital EX | DTS-ES Certification:Taiwan:PG-12 | Canada:PG (Ontario) | France:U | Iceland:L | Iceland:LH (video rating) | Malaysia:U | South Korea:All | Brazil:10 | Sweden:7 | Argentina:Atp | Australia:PG | Chile:TE | Finland:K-11 | Germany:6 | Hong Kong:IIA | Ireland:PG | Netherlands:MG6 | Philippines:G | Singapore:PG | Switzerland:10 (canton of Geneva) | Switzerland:10 (canton of Vaud) | Switzerland:12 (canton of Zurich) | UK:PG | USA:PG (NO. 41164)Filming Locations:Downey Studios - 12214 Lakewood Boulevard, Downey, California, USASee more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»Company:Paramount PicturesSee more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\n\n\n\nCOMMENT AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28959d4495c3a0448ee72093ab3971ce024a780","amp;dn":"LEMONY+SNICKET%5C%27S+THE+SERIES+OF+UNFORTUNATE+EVENTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28959d4495c3a0448ee72093ab3971ce024a780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,137,89,212,73,92,58,4,72,238,114,9,58,179,151,28,224,36,167,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
