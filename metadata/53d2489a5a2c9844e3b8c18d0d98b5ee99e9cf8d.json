The continuing Editor-in-Chief,\nRobert Meyers, and the Board prepared a new topical outline of physical science and \ntechnology to define complete coverage. Section editors are either Nobel Laureates or editors\nof key journals in their fields. Additional Board members representing the global scientific \ncommunity were also recruited.\n\nSubject:\nChemical Engineeging\nEnvironmental Science\nLasers and Masers\nMeasurements,Techniques &amp; Instrumentation\nEnergy\nAtmospheric Sciences\nMolecular Biology\nBiotechnology \nBiochemistry\nOrganic Chemistry\nInorganic Chemistry\nComputer Hardware\nComputer Software\nPolymers\nOptics\nAstronomy\nAnalytical Chemistry\nPhysical Chemistry\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53d2489a5a2c9844e3b8c18d0d98b5ee99e9cf8d","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Physical+Science+and+Technology%2C+3rd+Edition%2C+18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53d2489a5a2c9844e3b8c18d0d98b5ee99e9cf8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,210,72,154,90,44,152,68,227,184,193,141,13,152,181,238,153,233,207,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
