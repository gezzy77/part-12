This clandestine movement was evidenced by such early groups as the Nazarenes, Ebionites, and Elkesaites but is generally thought to have died out when the Church of Paul branded these groups as heretics. However, despite the ongoing persecution by the Roman Catholic orthodoxy, this underground Jewish strain of Christianity was able to survive and resist incorporation into its more powerful rival. Jeffrey BÃƒÂ¼tz, author of The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Teachings of Christianity, reveals for the first time the hidden theological link that connects James the Brother of Jesus and the Ebionites with the religion of Islam, the Cathars, the Knights Templar, and Freemasonry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9de3fb3db03670d4ca4a45214c1d08a333993942","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Legacy+of+Jesus%3A+The+Judaic+Teachings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9de3fb3db03670d4ca4a45214c1d08a333993942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,227,251,61,176,54,112,212,202,74,69,33,76,29,8,163,51,153,57,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
