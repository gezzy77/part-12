Employed in his new benefactor's casino, Johnny finds himself caught between his sense of loyalty and his desire for his host's sultry wife, Gilda (Hayworth), a woman he was once involved with Stateside. \n\nStoking the sexual tension to almost unbearable levels, while never losing sight of just how morally bankrupt these three characters are, Vidor dissects male desire with the clinical precision of a Freudian analyst: Johnny, trapped in a masochistic love-hate relationship with siren Gilda, finds his misogyny building in direct proportion to his homoerotic ties to Mundson. \n\nFull of over-determined Freudian symbolism (in particular, a decidedly phallic sword cane), a remarkable amount of (surprisingly frank) sexual innuendo and a terrifically vampish performance from Hayworth (whose rendition of 'Put The Blame On Mame' is guaranteed to turn heads), Gilda's vision of the castrating female and the men who become her victims is pitched somewhere between artful eroticism and hysterical nightmare.\n\nBlistering, breathless and completely hysterical, Gilda stands as a classic synthesis of film noir's obsession with sex, morality and masculinity and as one of Hayworth's greatest performances.\n\nNot long after his arrival in Buenos Aires, crooked gambler Johnny Farrell is hired by the wealthy entrepreneur Ballin Mundson to work in his illicit casino. When Mundson returns from a business trip, Johnny is surprised when he learns that his employer has married his former lover, Gilda. Johnny still hasn't forgiven Gilda for walking out on him, so he uses his position to torment her. She, in turn, provokes him by flirting with any eligible young man she meets. When two Nazis appear unexpectedly and demand the return of the money they gave him during the war, Mundson kills one of them and stages his own suicide to evade arrest. Johnny wastes no time in marrying Gilda, but soon realises he has made a terrible mistake... \n\nGilda is a film that has absolutely everything Ã¢â‚¬â€œ give it a chance this summer over your Potters and your Pirates.\n\nOne of the great films noirs.
