K. Pockett EPUB,MOBI~KnightinKat\n\nLanguage: English | Format: EPUB,MOBI\nGenre: Romance,Young Adult\namazon: B00NZAPQHE \n\nAbout:\n\n\n\nWhat happens when an unsuspecting girl and guy are thrown into a marriage they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want?\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly the case of Ivory and Darius, born into different families whose marriage serves to prevent competition between their businesses.\n\nNo matter how they oppose the idea, their parents are hell-bent on marrying them to each other to honor a five-generation-old deal that took place between their ancestors.\n\nFor Ivory, whose heart has just been broken, her marriage to the handsome but cold Darius Quartz fails to provide her the happy life she wants. Instead, she finds herself in endless boredom and doing the same things sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been doing the past six months.\n\nThat is, until Darius arrives home from his training and her ex returns in the picture. Thrown in her loyal best friend, Rose, and DariusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insane cousin, Adrian. Her life suddenly turns upside down and becomes exciting and a whole lot crazier!\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long journey full of tears, fun, joy, even insanity, and most of all, love.\n\nReview\n\nFew authors are able to convey a mix of emotions at once in their writing. Seldom do we find books where we can cry and laugh and feel all the things that the characters go through. And when we find that book, we are hooked. Just like Marriage by Law, a poignant story that's going to change your mind about forced marriages. Makes you want to wish (crazily) that somehow, your great-grandparents promised your hand in marriage to another person who turns out to be the exact opposite of who you want to be with for the rest of your life. And just like Ivory and Darius, you end up falling for each other. This book is worth every cent you'll pay for it. It was enjoyable to read and imagine the things that Ivory went through, to laugh like crazy at Adrian's antics, and fall in love with the mysterious and cold Darius. This book is one journey that will take you from Ivory's boring life (at first) to one where a forced marriage can actually end up in love. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nfor any queries and reseeds if the file is not downloading pm/request reseed.\n\nIf you do like my uploads do support me by commenting and rating the torrent . also please help me keep the torrent alive by sharing and seeding.. !\n\nCheers \n~KnightinKat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55021919a168dc506b6fa16059248131707a653","amp;dn":"Marriage+by+Law+By+N.+K.+Pockett+EPUB%2CMOBI+%7EKnightinKat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55021919a168dc506b6fa16059248131707a653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,80,33,145,154,22,141,197,6,182,250,22,5,146,72,19,23,7,166,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
