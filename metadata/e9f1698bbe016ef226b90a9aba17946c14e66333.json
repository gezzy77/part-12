I have to say I was amazed at \nhow many mutant stories were being published at the same time and \neven after AvX that completely ignored  AvX happening.  What a \nheadache it was trying  to put all this stuff in order. This section \nof X-Men stories are great.  I have been reading the X-Men since \naround #100, (and I was like 10)  when there was only one title.  \nThe Byrne, Claremont, Austin days were hard to beat, but the modern \nX-Men of the last 10 years have been equally amazing.\n\nI am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy reading \nruns of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  Maybe \nthe demise (?) of Demonoid brought about the end of the Chronological \nPacks I had been following.  Since pack 27 came out in 2010, until a \nfew months ago I had resisted reading the X-Men and Avengers, at \nleast until AvX wrapped up. I then embarked on the task of putting \ntogether my own collection from where pack 27 left off.  Since I \nhavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen anyone else put up this material, and I went to all the \neffort, I figured I should share.  I have 2 more packs to follow that \nshould get close to the current releases.  After that if there is \ninterest, I could put out previous packs.\n\nMy ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  I am trying to follow \nall of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  \nSo for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers \ntitle, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at \nall I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the \nmutant family, so you will see his stuff here also.  I think the \norders here work pretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see \nfit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me \nknow.  I will try to work them in.\n\nThese are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn \nout such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by \ntheir makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.\n\nThese issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors \nand illustrators.\n\nIssues are almost all from 2012 (possibly a few from 2011)\n\nThe format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the \nlanguage is ENGLISH\n\nHere are the specific issues to found herein:\n\nWolverine 20, 300-309, + annual 1\nX-Factor 229-240\nDeadpool MAX II 1-6\nDeadpool Kills The Marvel Universe 1-4\nVenom 13-14 (six issues)\nNew Mutants 37-46\nX-Men Legacy 261-265\nWolverine &amp; The X-Men 5-8,17\nUncanny X-Force 20-35\nUncanny X-Men 4-10\nSecret Avengers 20-25\nX-Men 24-35\nX-23 20-21\nAstonishing X-Men 48-56, + annual 1\nExiled 1\nJourney Into Mystery 637-638\nFantastic Four Annual 33\nDaredevil Annual 1\nGambit 1-7\n\nTwo more Packs to be released.
