A plane carrying three convicts -- Harry (Frank Sinatra), Marcel Gregoire Aslan and Charlie Bernie Hamilton) -- lands on the island; Father Doonan (Tracy) manages to enlist their (reluctant) aid in working at a children's hospital. When the island falls victim to a series of earthquakes, Father Doonan and the convicts work together to evacuate the hospital staff and the children. Harry, the least cooperative of the prisoners, becomes a hero during a volcanic eruption by going back to rescue the priest, who with convict Charlie has been holding a bridge in order to allow the others to escape. Father Doonan and the two convicts are killed, but all the children are rescued. Blighted by bad special effects and ponderous direction, Devil at Four O'Clock is less interesting than the behind-the-scenes rumors concerning the friction between Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054805/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054805/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-54805/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-54805/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nMervyn LeRoy\n\n\n\n\n        Spencer Tracy\t ... \tFather Matthew Doonan\n\n\tFrank Sinatra\t... \tHarry\n\tKerwin Mathews\t... \tFather Joseph Perreau\n\tJean-Pierre Aumont... \tJacques (as Jean Pierre Aumont)\n\tGrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©goire Aslan\t... \tMarcel (as Gregoire Aslan)\n\n\n\n Video #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.109\n      Stream size : 872 MiB (83%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 - 192 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 167 MiB (16%)\n\n\n\n     Please seed at least as much as you D/L.\n     =======================================\n     Thanks \n\n     John","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fc93023014f3c238a5f406256bca612d42929ad","amp;dn":"The+Devil+at+4+O%5C%27Clock+%281961%29+Spencer+Tracy+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fc93023014f3c238a5f406256bca612d42929ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,201,48,35,1,79,60,35,138,95,64,98,86,188,166,18,212,41,41,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
