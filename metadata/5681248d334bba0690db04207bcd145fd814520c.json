It was released on September 28, 1988 and was re-issued / remastered on August 22, 1995 and again on June 25, 2002. The album was certified gold in December 1988 and has since gone double platinum. It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Overview\n    2 Track listing\n    3 Personnel\n   \nOverview\n\nNo Rest for the Wicked is the recording debut of lead guitarist Zakk Wylde.[6] After parting ways with lead guitarist Jake E. Lee in 1987, Osbourne received a demo tape from Wylde and later hired him. Bassist/lyricist Bob Daisley made his return to Osbourne's band after the two had a falling out in 1985. Once the album's recording was complete, Daisley was once again out, replaced by Osbourne's former Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler.\n\n&quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;Crazy Babies&quot;, and &quot;Breakin' All the Rules&quot; were released as singles with accompanying music videos. The song &quot;Hero&quot; was an unlisted hidden bonus track on the original 1988 release, and at that time was commonly believed to be titled &quot;Fools Know More&quot;. The song &quot;Miracle Man&quot; was a pointed barb aimed at disgraced televangelist Jimmy Swaggart. Swaggart had long been critical of Osbourne's music and live performances, before he himself was involved in a 1988 prostitution scandal.\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Miracle Man&quot;   \tOzzy Osbourne, Zakk Wylde, Bob Daisley \t3:44\n2. \t&quot;Devil's Daughter (Holy War)&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Randy Castillo, John Sinclair \t5:15\n3. \t&quot;Crazy Babies&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo \t4:15\n4. \t&quot;Breakin' All the Rules&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo, Sinclair \t5:15\n5. \t&quot;Bloodbath in Paradise&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo, Sinclair \t5:03\n6. \t&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo, Sinclair \t6:24\n7. \t&quot;Tattooed Dancer&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley \t3:53\n8. \t&quot;Demon Alcohol&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo \t4:30\n9. \t&quot;Hero&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Castillo, Sinclair \t4:49\nTotal length:\n\t43:08 \t\n2002 reissue bonus tracks\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n10. \t&quot;The Liar&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley, Sinclair \t4:32\n11. \t&quot;Miracle Man (Live)&quot;   \tOsbourne, Wylde, Daisley \t3:48\nTotal length:\n\t51:28 \t\nPersonnel\n\n    Ozzy Osbourne - vocals\n    Zakk Wylde - guitar\n    Bob Daisley - bass\n    Randy Castillo - drums\n    John Sinclair - keyboards\nIf you like it buy it,  and seed this ..........................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5681248d334bba0690db04207bcd145fd814520c","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+-+No+Rest+For+The+Wicked+mp3++320k++1988%28req%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5681248d334bba0690db04207bcd145fd814520c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,129,36,141,51,75,186,6,144,219,4,32,123,205,20,95,216,20,82,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
