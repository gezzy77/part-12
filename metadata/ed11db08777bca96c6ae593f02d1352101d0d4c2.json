The Lydian Concept eschewed bebop's rigorous chord restructurings and instead proposed composition and improvisation based on scales or modes. Though the concept may sound offputting, Russell composed jazz works that masterfully incorporated all bebop's adventures with latent exploratory strains that would become central to avant-garde jazz. Ezz is no exception. Eric Dolphy's alto sax and bass clarinet keep the music punchy and edgy, while trumpeter Don Ellis and trombonist Dave Baker give these complex melodies an earthy, soulful feel. This 1961 salvo remains an awesome introductory CD for all jazz listeners. --Andrew Bartlett","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed11db08777bca96c6ae593f02d1352101d0d4c2","amp;dn":"George+Russell+Sextet+-+Ezz-thetics+%281961%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed11db08777bca96c6ae593f02d1352101d0d4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,17,219,8,119,123,202,150,198,174,89,63,2,209,53,33,1,208,212,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
