Her roots in hypnosis go back to the 1960s. She has been specializing in past-life therapy since 1979.\n\nDolores has become, perhaps, the world's most unlikely expert on the prophecies of Nostradamus. A retired Navy wife from Huntsville, AR, USA, Dolores was nearly fifty years old when she began experimenting with hypnosis and past-life regression. The results were, to say the least, quite spectacular!\n\nWorking through several different subjects, Dolores was able to establish communication with the living Michel De Notredame, better known as the prophet, Nostradamus. His revelations and their impact on our own time are both fascinating and at times frightening.\n\nDolores has written the three volume set &quot;Conversations With Nostradamus&quot;, the series on the translation of Nostradamus' quatrains. This series contains the translation of almost 1000 prophecies, all interpreted for the first time and have been in print since 1989. It is considered the most accurate interpretation of the prophecies ever printed.\n\nDolores has been a UFO investigator for twenty years, using her skills as a regressionist to help people that had been involved in abduction cases. She has written several books on the UFO information volunteers have revealed while under hypnosis.\n\nDolores is now teaching her unique technique of hypnosis all over the world.\n\nIn addition to the three volumes of &quot;Converstations With Nostradamus&quot;, Dolores has completed:&quot;The Legend of Starcrash&quot;, &quot;Keepers of the Garden&quot;, &quot;Legacy from the Stars&quot;, &quot;A Soul Remembers Hiroshima&quot;, &quot;They Walked With Jesus&quot;, &quot;Jesus and the Essenes&quot; and &quot;Between Death and Life&quot;. &quot;The Custodians&quot;, discusses in detail information regarding distorted time, screen memories, reasons for abductions, implants and much, much more....\n\nHer latest book, &quot;The Convoluted Universe, Book One&quot;, goes further into complex metaphysical theories and covers &quot;mind-bending&quot; concepts.\n\nOther books dealing with more of her most interesting hypnosis cases are forthcoming.\n\nDolores has been touring in the USA, England, Europe, the former Soviet countries, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia to promote her works, and to discuss her particular brand of psychic research. She has spoken to radio and television audiences worldwide. She has given lectures at such locations as: Whole Life Expos in Los Angeles, New York and San Diego; Global Science Congress; various A.R.E. Edgar Cayce Foundations; Conscious Living Expo and MBS Expo in Australia; The College of Psychic Studies in London, England; The Theosophical Society in London, England; as well as many other organizations. Dolores was the first American and the first foreigner to receive the &quot;Orpheus Award&quot; in Bulgaria, for the highest advancement in the research of psychic phenomenom.\n\nArticles by/about Dolores have appeared in several magazines including: &quot;Body, Mind and Spirit&quot;; &quot;Magical Blend&quot;; &quot;Connecting Link&quot;; &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot; (an England magazine); &quot;People Magazine&quot; (an Australian magazine); &quot;Conscious Living Magazine&quot; (an Australian magazine); &quot;After Dark&quot; (the Art Bell magazine); &quot;The Unknown Magazine&quot;; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; and &quot;New York Times&quot;.
