The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed In a Silent Way album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style.\n\nBitches Brew was Davis's first gold record, selling more than half a million copies. Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album's unconventional style and revolutionary sound. Later, Bitches Brew gained recognition as one of jazz's greatest albums and a progenitor of the jazz rock genre, as well as a major influence on rock and funk musicians...\n\nIn 1998, Columbia Records released The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, a four-disc box set that included the original album as well as the studio sessions through February 1970.\nThe set collects tracks that Davis recorded between August 19, 1969 and February 6, 1970, including the 1970 double album Bitches Brew in its entirety. However, the title of the box set is somewhat of a misnomer: outside of the Bitches Brew tracks themselves, none of the other tracks appeared on Bitches Brew upon its original release, nor were they recorded during the same August 1969 sessions that resulted in Bitches Brew. Furthermore, additional material recorded for, but not used in Bitches Brew, is not included in this set.\nThe box set includes some tracks that had never been previously released, one of which, the Wayne Shorter composition &quot;Feio,&quot; has since appeared as a bonus track on compact disc reissues of Bitches Brew. Other tracks in the box set had previously appeared on the albums Live-Evil, Big Fun, and Circle in the Round.\n\nThe set was reissued on 11 May 2004 with new packaging.\n\n(from: &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitches_Brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitches_Brew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Bitches_Brew_Sessions)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Bitches_Brew_Sessions)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDisc one\n\n   1. &quot;Pharaoh's Dance&quot; (Joe Zawinul)  20:06\n   2. &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (Miles Davis)  26:58\n   3. &quot;Spanish Key&quot; (Davis)  17:34\n   4. &quot;John McLaughlin&quot; (Davis)  4:22\n\nDisc two\n\n   1. &quot;Miles Runs the Voodoo Down&quot; (Davis)  14:01\n   2. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (Wayne Shorter)  10:56\n   3. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (Davis - Zawinul)  13:45\n   4. &quot;Orange Lady&quot; (Zawinul)  13:50\n   5. &quot;Yaphet&quot; (Davis)  9:39\n   6. &quot;Corrado&quot; (Davis)  13:11\n\nDisc three\n\n   1. &quot;Trevere&quot; (Davis)  5:55\n   2. &quot;The Big Green Serpent&quot; (Davis)  3:35\n   3. &quot;The Little Blue Frog&quot; (alternate take) (Davis)  12:13\n   4. &quot;The Little Blue Frog&quot; (Davis)  9:09\n   5. &quot;Lonely Fire&quot; (Davis)  21:09\n   6. &quot;Guinnevere&quot; (David Crosby)  21:07\n\nDisc four\n\n   1. &quot;Feio&quot; (Shorter)  11:49\n   2. &quot;Double Image&quot; (Zawinul)  8:25\n   3. &quot;Recollections&quot; (Zawinul)  18:54\n   4. &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; (Zawinul)  2:13\n   5. &quot;Double Image&quot; (Zawinul)  5:52\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2104331a24b555c3c629c83a634eebb1bf1ee425","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+1970+-+The+Complete+Bitches+Brew+Sessions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2104331a24b555c3c629c83a634eebb1bf1ee425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,4,51,26,36,181,85,195,198,41,200,58,99,78,235,177,191,30,228,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
