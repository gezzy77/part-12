Norman Yoffee challenges the model in this book by presenting more complex and multi-linear models for the evolution of civilizations. Yoffee questions the definition of the prehistoric state, particularly that which heralds &quot;the chiefdom&quot; as the forerunner of the ancient state and explores case studies on the role of women in ancient societies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27684458980fbbbd25924379e0a10d967d3cbe92","amp;dn":"Myths+of+the+Archaic+State+-+Evolution+of+the+Earliest+Cities%2C+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27684458980fbbbd25924379e0a10d967d3cbe92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,104,68,88,152,15,187,189,37,146,67,121,224,161,13,150,125,60,190,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
