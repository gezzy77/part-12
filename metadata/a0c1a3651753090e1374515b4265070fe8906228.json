Although based in Europe, the band was truly multinational, also having several US musicians in the line-up. \n\nIt was disbanded in 1972, after having recorded more than 15 albums. They released many of their albums on the German jazz record label MPS Records and members of this stellar outfit included Johnny Griffin, Eddie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLockjawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Davis, Ronnie Scott, Carl Drewo, Tony Coe, Derek Humble, Nat Peck, Ake Persson, Dusko Goykovich, Stan Sulzmann, Ack van Rooyen, John Surman, Jimmy Deuchar, Manfred Schoof, Albert Mangelsdorff, Eric van Lier, Ron Mathewson, Fats Sadi, Kenny Clare, Benny Bailey, Jimmy Woode, Art Farmer, Sahib Shihab, Shake Keane, Idrees Sulieman, Herb Geller, Jimmy Deuchar, and were joined on occasions by Phil Woods, Zoot Sims, Stan Getz and many others. \n\nIn between the much-acclaimed, epic recordings made by the Clarke-Boland big band, there were a number of memorable small group sessions, featuring key sidemen from the big band, which over the years have tended to be forgotten. This excellent 20-track compilation is largely a composite of two sessions: one recorded in the Alten Bahnhof von Rolandseck in Germany on September 25,1965 and the other recorded in Berlin on June 16, 1965. This is great and very hard-to-find latin-tinged music (used copies sell for big bucks on the used market), enjoy.\n\nPersonnel: \nBass - Jimmy Woode \nDrums - Kenny Clarke \nFlute - Sahib Shihab \nPercussion - Joe Harris \nPiano, Arranger - Francy Boland \nVibraphone, Percussion - Fats Sadi \n\nKenny Clarke-Francy Boland Sextet - Calypso Blues Tracks: \n01  Ebony Samba (3:55) \n02  Tin Tin Deo (2:53) \n03  Please DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Leave (4:09) \n04  Lush Life (4:27) \n05  The Man From PotterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Crossing (3:17) \n06  Wives And Lovers (3:20) \n07  Ensadinado (2:32) \n08  Lorraine (3:52) \n09  Love Hungry (3:42) \n10  Balafon (3:05) \n11  Day By Day (2:41) \n12  Calypso Blues (4:06) \n13  Invitation ( 4:38 ) \n14  Insensatez (2:41) \n15  Serenata (3:23) \n16  Con Alma (5:03) \n17  Just Give Me Time (3:11) \n18  Born To Be Blue (3:49) \n19  Lilemor (4:25) \n20  Sconsolato (2:32)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c1a3651753090e1374515b4265070fe8906228","amp;dn":"Kenny+Clarke-Francy+Boland+Sextet+-+Calypso+Blues+%281965%29+%5BJazz%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c1a3651753090e1374515b4265070fe8906228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,193,163,101,23,83,9,14,19,116,81,91,66,101,7,15,232,144,98,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
