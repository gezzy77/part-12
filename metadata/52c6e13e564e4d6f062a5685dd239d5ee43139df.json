This was also by virtue of the fact that it was the first work that was based on Lorca, by the artist who has so far been the best at adapting learned poetry to flamenco. The new version includes a text written by Juan de Loxa, the current director of the museum-house, who remembers hearing El lenguaje de las flores for the first time, during a memorable concert in Paris.
