Nor will traditional favorites be neglected; the book will offer multiple ways to make applesauce, baked apples, pies, tarts, muffins, crisps, pastries and cookies. The recipes in the book will be accompanied by crafty, room decor and ambience-enhancing projects such as seasonal centerpieces and apple-scented candles, designed for a delightful, multi-sensory apple experience.\nNotes on apple varieties will instruct on picking the perfect apple for any occasion and sidebars will be used to reflect interesting apple stats, tales from literature and folklore, pairing tips, and surprising apple fun facts. Also sprinkled throughout are quotations and favorite apple recipes shared by some of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular celebrity chefs, reflecting a variety of different cultures and styles of cuisine, such as Michael Gilligan and Ian Kittichai.\nSee, smell, and best of all taste for yourself, hundreds of ways to enjoy one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most versatile fruits of all time.\n\nAbout the Authors\nKaren Berman is writer and editor who specializes in food and lifestyle topics.
