I find this kind of ebook torrent much more useful than most because it is a coherent series that lets you progressively master a subject from beginner level to professional.\n\nThe files in this torrent were collected from various sources: old torrents, other current torrents, file hosts, and web sites. I make sure to examine and document every file because I use the package myself, auto-didact that I am.\n\n\nTHE INTERACTIVE WEB from WROX\n\nThis QGTP contains a few ebooks from Wrox Press (wrox.com), the computer programming books division of Wiley Publishing, on Web 2.0 development, i.e. the latest techniques using Javascript and AJAX to make interactive, desktop application-like web pages. The core of the collection is a &quot;Wrox Box&quot; of 4 books, but other closely related Wrox books were added for an expanded study line.\n\nFor each book the source code examples (and other material discussed), as provided by the publisher, are included (when available).\n\nThe order presented below is only a suggestion based on the various authors' descriptions of each book's subject matter and target audience. Note also that the presentation level is quite technical throughout, even for beginners: these books are written by professional programmers for programmers.\n\n\nLevel: beginner\n------------------------------\n\nWrox - Beginning Javascript 3rd Ed (2007).pdf\n+ example code\nThis book aims to teach you all you need to know to start experimenting with JavaScript: what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. In order to get the most out of this book, you'll need to have an understanding of HTML and how to create a static web page. You don't need to have any programming experience.\n\nWrox - Beginning AJAX (2007).pdf\n+ example code\nUsing proven examples and explaining concepts step by step, this book shows you how building Ajax-enabled sites and applications allows more interactive user interfaces than ever before. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about the differences in capabilities between client-side and server-side development techniques, as well as how Ajax crosses this boundary. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also discover how Ajax techniques can be summed up by patterns (which are development models that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use repeatedly). With a mastery of these techniques, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be able to breathe new life into your Web sites. \n\n\nLevel: intermediate\n------------------------------\n\nWrox - Professional JavaScript for Web Developers (2005).pdf\n+ example code\n* Dispels the myth that JavaScript is a &quot;baby&quot; language and demonstrates why it is the scripting language of choice used in the design of millions of Web pages and server-side applications\n* Quickly covers JavaScript basics and then moves on to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, XML, Web services, and remote scripting\n* Addresses the many issues that Web application developers face, including internationalization, security, privacy, optimization, intellectual property issues, and obfuscation\n* Builds on the reader's basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and the Web in general\n\nWrox - Professional Web 2.0 Programming (2007).pdf\n+ example code\nWeb 2.0 architecture opens up an incredible number of options for flexible web design, creative reuse, and easier updates. Along with covering the key languages and techniques of Web 2.0, this unique book introduces you to all of the technologies that make up Web 2.0 at a professional level. Throughout the chapters, you'll find code for several example applications built with popular frameworks that you'll be able to utilize.\nThis book is for professional developers who have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML.\n\n\nLevel: advanced\n------------------------------\n\nWrox - Professional AJAX 2nd Ed (2007).pdf\n+ example code\nFor Web application developers looking to enhance the usability of their web sites and web applications and intermediate JavaScript developers looking to further understand the language. Readers should have familiarity with XML, XSLT, Web Services, PHP or C#, HTML, CSS. This book is not aimed at beginners without a basic understanding of the aforementioned technologies. Also, a good understanding of JavaScript is vitally important to understanding this book.\n\nWrox - Professional Rich Internet Applications AJAX and Beyond (2007).pdf\n+example code\nThrough the use of hands-on examples and case studies to explain complex technologies, this comprehensive book takes AJAX, Ruby on Rails, and Flash to the next level by combining them into a framework for developing rich Internet applications. Also includes coverage of such various technologies as DHTML, JavaScript, XSLT, Java, Python, PHP, and more.\n\n\nThe 4-book JavaScript and Ajax Wrox Box (ISBN: 0470227818) includes the intermediate and advanced titles above.\n\nFor those who want to perfect their web development skills, I hope this torrent proves useful. More QGTP torrents will be assembled over the next few months. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome. -QuietGeek\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a36bbce545ebb9eed7b458f32fec4622ecf54f79","amp;dn":"Wrox+-+Javascript+AJAX+Web+2.0+QGTP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a36bbce545ebb9eed7b458f32fec4622ecf54f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,107,188,229,69,235,185,238,215,180,88,243,47,236,70,34,236,245,79,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
