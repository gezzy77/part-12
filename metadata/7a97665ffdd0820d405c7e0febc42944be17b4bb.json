As a service, MemTurbo monitors your system in the background, freeing resources when needed. By maximizing the performance of physical memory you already have, MemTurbo may reduce the need to acquire additional physical memory.\n\n\nGet faster Windows functionality\nMemTurbo allows you fine-tune your Windows system. It helps your system run faster by optimizing processor scheduling, allocating more critical threads, tuning idle programs and temporarily disabling swapping of operating system components to hard drive.\n\n\nClear and easy display of memory resources\nYou can check the status of physical and virtual memory in real time. The memory statistics include used and available memory. Both are presented graphically and numerically.\n\n\nControl processes with Task Manager\nThe new Task Manager lets you monitor the running processes. You can end a running task, set priorities, or invoke new programs.\n\n\nEffective utilization of memory resources\nThe built-in MemTurbo engine manages free memory that is available to run programs. It prevents performance from degrading as files and programs are swapped in and out of memory. \n\n \n \nManage allocation of system memory resources\nMemTurbo can be set to run in your system tray to automatically provide better resource allocation. However, you can optimize the resources manually by defragging and recovering memory leaks whenever you wish to do so. \n\n\nCPU Rocket and RAM Tuner Technology\nMemTurbo includes CPU Rocket and RAM Tuner technologies which fine-tune your memory allocation and processor optimization to the most active applications. This focuses the power of your computer directly on the programs you use most, maximizing your computer's performance.\n\n\nTemporary removal of unused files\nSometimes applications load files that are intermittently used by them. MemTurbo safely removes these files out to the system paging file, freeing up the RAM to improve performance. While in this state, they are immediately and transparently reloaded if needed.\n\n  Key Benefits for Gamers\nGaming applications may require high CPU usage and consume large amounts of memory to support better graphics display and performance. As a result, the performance of running applications may degrade and the applications may perform poorly. In these situations, MemTurbo can optimize your gaming needs.\n\n\nNo slow down after optimization\nMemTurbo is designed to optimize the performance of your computer while you are running games. It tweaks and modifies various Windows cache management, its settings and manages the process priorities to balance CPU usage. This is performed between all running applications.\n\n\nAutomatic cache management\nMemTurbo can be configured precisely to suit your needs. MemTurbo runs in the background to help reclaim wasted memory on your computer. It guards the allocation of memory resources through its unique high performance the cache management technique. Using this technique, it has the ability to dynamically allocate the cache depending upon the size of memory.\n\n\nA small footprint in memory\nMemTurbo takes up a small space of memory when it runs in the background. It takes care of your memory resources by residing in the system tray, efficiently allocating the memory to be running current or newly added applications. It continues to show the memory that is available, providing you with a status update.\n\n  Key Benefits for Home Users\nSystem cache can be efficiently managed with MemTurbo. \nThis can be understood by referring the example.\nSuppose you work mostly on the same set of data or files everyday. For instance, you may use Microsoft Word to edit the same documents. MemTurbo will save the name and path/location of these files and the application in the cache, so that Windows will not need to search for them again. This cuts down on application response times and provides you with faster access to applications and files. Further techniques that MemTurbo uses are explained below:\n\n\nHigh Performance Engine for Cache Management\nDynamic cache is optimized by memory. Cache size is set to the maximum, based on free memory that's available.\n\nOccupies a Small Space in Memory\nMemTurbo is an easy to use, light application that takes up little space in the systems memory. It doesn't take up unnecessary RAM.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a97665ffdd0820d405c7e0febc42944be17b4bb","amp;dn":"MemTurbo+4.1.0331+Portable-Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a97665ffdd0820d405c7e0febc42944be17b4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,151,102,95,253,208,130,13,64,92,126,15,235,196,41,68,190,23,180,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
