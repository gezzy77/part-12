Featured are complete takes of such all-time favorite songs as &quot;Fugue for Tinhorns,&quot; &quot;Adelaide's Lament,&quot; &quot;Sue Me,&quot; &quot;The Oldest Established,&quot; and &quot;Luck Be a Lady.&quot; Especially thrilling are the company numbers, including one of Broadway's greatest showstoppers, &quot;Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat.&quot; In addition to the music, director Jerry Zaks and musical director Edward Strauss offer coaching on the harder numbers (we thankfully see only two of the first 129 takes of &quot;My Time of Day&quot;), and stars Peter Gallagher, Josie de Guzman, Nathan Lane, and Faith Prince offer commentary on the show and their characters. This video does a terrific job of capturing the excitement, tension, and energy of the studio and is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys Broadway cast recordings. --David Horiuchi\n\nProduct Description\nOff the Record is an exciting documentary that goes behind the scenes and follows the cast around while they are making the recording of the Tony AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® winning production Guys and Dolls.
