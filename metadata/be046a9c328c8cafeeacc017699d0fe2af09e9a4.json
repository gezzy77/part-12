Her immense growth as a songwriter is evident through out the album, especially as she is able to bring optimism and energy even to the record's darker moments. The first single &quot;Little Bit of Red&quot; grabs listeners instantly with its hook, but keeps pulling them in as it also has a lot to say.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n1. Sweeping The Ashes\n2.
