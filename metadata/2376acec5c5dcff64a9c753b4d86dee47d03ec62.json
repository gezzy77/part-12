Full Boost is the sequel to the fan favorite Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS.  Like it's predecessor, this arcade based Gundam-on-Gundam fighting game blazes through with increased features and epic battles akin to the Gundam Extreme series. As a port of the arcade version, expect additional units exclusive to the PS3.\n\nGameplay revolves around strategically choosing a squad and sending them into battle; there are many Gundams to choose from, from vague one shot characters to famous flagship mechas from almost every series. In battle, there is the standard arcade mode faithfully representing it's source material as well as an amalgam of extra missions and content. Actual gameplay changes are the introduction of 2 important additions: the Extreme Action where players have the ability to dash-cancel attacks for chaining complex combos and the Extreme Burst, a super mode reminiscent of the original's Awakening mode. During the Extreme Burst, an ultimate attack called the Burst Attack can be used, and each mobile suit has two types of this attack to choose from.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2376acec5c5dcff64a9c753b4d86dee47d03ec62","amp;dn":"Mobile+Suit+Gundam+Extreme+Vs.+Full+Boost+BLJS10250","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2376acec5c5dcff64a9c753b4d86dee47d03ec62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,118,172,236,92,93,207,246,74,156,117,59,77,134,222,228,125,3,236,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
