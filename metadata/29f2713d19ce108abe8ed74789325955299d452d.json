The two put down the angular brood and rage of their old bands Fugazi and the Warmers to begin stripped-down duo The Evens in 2001, with drums, baritone guitar, and softly menacing harmonies being the sole elements to most of their compositions. The Odds is record number three from The Evens, following a six-year gap since their last self-titled album, during which the couple spent some time becoming new parents and focusing on all the things that come along with children, even when you happen to be both parents and figureheads of the punk movement. Instead of the shift toward softer kid-friendly sounds that sometimes happens when makers of aggressive music have children, The Evens return with the same moodiness, urgency, and righteous anger that marked their earlier work. While the songs never take on the explosive jettison of Fugazi or the mathy crash of the Warmers, a subdued, almost more sophisticated version of the same energy is right below the surface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f2713d19ce108abe8ed74789325955299d452d","amp;dn":"The+Evens+-+The+Odds+%282012%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f2713d19ce108abe8ed74789325955299d452d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,242,113,61,25,206,16,138,190,142,215,71,137,50,89,85,41,157,69,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
