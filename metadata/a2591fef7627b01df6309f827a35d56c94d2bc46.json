If you get static\nthen you do not have a true DST decoder.\n\nAbout the recording:\nI made this as a learning experiment.\nEach channel was created as a mono wave in Sound Forge 9.\nThe individual channels were then encoded with SurCode DTS encoder.\nOnly the FL,FR,LR and RR channels were used, no Subwoofer or Center channel\nwere encoded. Your equipment may &quot;synthisize&quot; these channels.\nThe encoded trackes were burned to an Audio CD image with Nero 8.\n\nAbout the Album:\nMyths and Legends is a two disc set.\nThe two discs are ment to be played back at the same time\non two different CD players. I encoded CD 1 on the front\nchannels and CD 2 on the rear.\n\nAbout the artist:\nDavid Arkenstone is an amazing artist.\nMore information can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.davidarkenstone.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.davidarkenstone.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nIf you enjoy this ablum please support the artist by\nbuying a copy like I did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2591fef7627b01df6309f827a35d56c94d2bc46","amp;dn":"David+Arkenstone+-+Myths+and+Legends+-+DTS+Surround","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2591fef7627b01df6309f827a35d56c94d2bc46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,89,31,239,118,39,176,29,246,48,159,130,122,53,213,108,148,210,188,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
