In this tour, filmed in 2004, Connolly visited New Zealand and travelled 8,500 km throughout the country, from Stewart Island in the south, through South Island and North Island, to Ninety Mile Beach in the north. As he did on his 1996 tour of Australia, Connolly travelled on a custom-made Yamaha XV1700 Warrior trike that had been built by the &quot;Trike Shop&quot; in the United Kingdom. The trike is now in the hands of a new owner in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe series was made up of eight episodes in which Connolly gave insights into the history and culture of the country, especially its Maori heritage, while also giving highlights from the New Zealand leg of his Too Old to Die Young tour. The leather jacket he often wore sports a skull with glasses, the logo of the tour.\nContinuing his catalogue of nude endeavours, he bungee jumped from the Nevis High Wire in Queenstown.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThe popular Scottish comedian tours the 'Land of the Long White Cloud' with his stand-up show Too Old to Die Young, taking to his trike for a spot of sightseeing along the way. His first stop is Stewart Island, where he performs to 255 people - half the local population - before travelling from Bluff to Dunedin, the country's answer to Edinburgh. Billy gets off the tourist trail and learns to fish Maori-style as he uncovers the real New Zealand\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6463/worldtourofnewzealandsce.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6463/worldtourofnewzealandsce.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2438/worldtourofnewzealandscq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/2438/worldtourofnewzealandscq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9994/worldtourofnewzealandscf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9994/worldtourofnewzealandscf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9029/worldtourofnewzealandscv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9029/worldtourofnewzealandscv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6881/worldtourofnewzealandsc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6881/worldtourofnewzealandsc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6672/worldtourofnewzealandsck.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6672/worldtourofnewzealandsck.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8629/worldtourofnewzealandscu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/8629/worldtourofnewzealandscu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2831/worldtourofnewzealandsco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2831/worldtourofnewzealandsco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1796 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 40.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 560 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.billyconnolly.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.billyconnolly.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d12a70b049d9bec9a3835934f0494e0ce2b4a4","amp;dn":"BBC+Billy+Connollys+World+Tour+of+New+Zealand+1of8+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d12a70b049d9bec9a3835934f0494e0ce2b4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,209,42,112,176,73,217,190,201,163,131,89,52,240,73,78,12,226,180,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
