The tracklisting used here represents the 30th November 1986 configuration. It would have been impossible to compile this release without using both officially released tracks and/or widely circulating outtakes - as they are what make up the majority of 'Crystal Ball'. However the beauty of this release is not the choice of tracks, it's their running order. 'Rebirth Of The Flesh' segues into 'Play In The Sunshine' (alt version with gun intro), and from there on it's pretty much the 'Sign O' The Times' album. 'The Ball' flows flawlessly (and I mean FLAWLESS) into 'Joy In Repetition', etc, etc. It may be due to the being SO familiar with the 'Sign O' The Times' album, but the running order of 'Adore' followed by 'It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night' just doesn't seem correct. As a document of Prince's unreleased album this (along with the previous Pimpsandwich 'Dream Factory') are awesome, extremely professional releases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac6756de150b31fdad722378fdd40c268c1f789","amp;dn":"Prince+-+Crystal+Ball+%28Unreleased+1986+Album%29+%5BPimpsandwich%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac6756de150b31fdad722378fdd40c268c1f789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,198,117,109,225,80,179,31,218,215,34,55,143,221,64,194,104,193,247,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
