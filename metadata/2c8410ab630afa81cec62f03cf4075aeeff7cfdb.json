The artwork to Wallis BirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new album reminded me of one of those singers, from the messy pigtails and dreamy expression to the labret piercing. So far, so pigeonholed... until I pressed play and discovered an artist who could be anything but.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not uncommon to see the eponymous release early in an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, the self-title a bold manifesto; but that the Irish singer has chosen to wait until her third full-length album to do so isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really so strange. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know shit,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ her arresting alto opens on the dreamy &quot;Dress My Skin and Become What IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Supposed To&quot;, clipping the final consonant just enough to lend the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slightly cynical message an air of menace.\n\nAnd then it all gets wild. Although playing her parts broadly on acoustic guitar, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing delicate about the way BirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice rips into relationship clichÃƒÂ©s on &quot;I Am So Tired of That Line&quot;. Lead single &quot;Encore&quot; rattles and screams over semi-electronic loops with a ridiculously hummable refrain while the wildness on display in &quot;Take Me Home&quot; is more of the earth as Bird whispers and moans of a world gone mad. &quot;Heartbeating City&quot;combines a tribal beat with whistles and carefree xylophone; a lilting, uplifting number which, backed with the full-on hoarse scream of &quot;WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Listening Now&quot;perfectly displays a singer unafraid to prune the best bits from across the genres.\n\nBut as incredible as those performances are, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when stripped of the drama that Bird is at her most affecting. In &quot;Dictum&quot;, at the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mid-point, is part-folk song part-full throated ballad, while the fragility of &quot;Feathered Pocket&quot; sounds as if it belongs on another album altogether. The album closes with &quot;Polarised&quot;, eight minutes of performance poetry and sonic experimentation.\n\nSo thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wallis Bird: pop star, balladeer, world music poet. Pigeonhole at your peril.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8410ab630afa81cec62f03cf4075aeeff7cfdb","amp;dn":"Wallis+Bird...Wallis+Bird%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c8410ab630afa81cec62f03cf4075aeeff7cfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,132,16,171,99,10,250,129,206,198,47,3,207,64,117,174,239,247,207,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
