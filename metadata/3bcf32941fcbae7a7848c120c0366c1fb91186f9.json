(It's likely that more than one parent has had to explain who Mickey \nRooney is after a listen to this album's &quot;Yakko's Universe,&quot; which name-checks \nthe diminutive star in its chorus.) The show about the surreal adventures of \nthe Warner brothers and their sister Dot, which was in production from 1993 \nto 1996, was full of clever visual puns, wildly obscure cultural references, and \na sharply satiric edge that likely whizzed right over most kids' heads, while \nremaining colorful and silly enough to keep even the youngest viewers \nentertained. The same can be said of this 1994 disc, the second of several \nCDs of songs from the series. The tunes, mostly written by music supervisor \nRichard Stone, with lyrics by Paul Rugg, Tom Ruegger, and the show's other \nwriters, are instantly memorable, both the originals and adaptations like \n&quot;Wakko's America&quot; (middle Warner sibling Wakko -- the one who sounds like \nGeorge Harrison circa A Hard Day's Night -- singing the state capitols to the \ntune of &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;) and &quot;The Panama Canal,&quot; a history lesson set \nto the old folk standard &quot;40 Miles on the Erie Canal.&quot; The lyrics are remarkably \nclever, full of dizzying internal rhymes that match Stephen Sondheim at his \nmost manic, and even the silliest of these songs -- that would be &quot;Lake \nTiticaca,&quot; a mambo dedicated to the world's highest freshwater lake with the \nworld's most giggleworthy name -- is smart and funny. Unfortunately, a \nquarter of these 16 songs already appeared on the first Animanics collection, \nbut the remainder are entertaining enough to make this a more than \nworthwhile purchase, even for those who don't have kids.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Animaniacs-Yakkos-World/master/202924&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Animaniacs-Yakkos-World/master/202924&lt;/a&gt;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcf32941fcbae7a7848c120c0366c1fb91186f9","amp;dn":"Animaniacs+-+Yakko%27s+World+%281994%29+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcf32941fcbae7a7848c120c0366c1fb91186f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,207,50,148,31,203,174,122,120,72,193,32,192,54,108,31,185,17,134,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
