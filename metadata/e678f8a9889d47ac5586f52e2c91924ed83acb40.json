The author's aims have been three - brevity, continuity, and a sense of proportion. He has kept as close to the limits of justifiable compression as possible. Important secondary artists have been omitted: biographical details are absent. But only by ruthless compression can continuity be assured. Each artist or group of artists is treated not as an isolated phenomenon but as a link in the growing chain of tradition. The emphasis is rather on the strength, the shape, and the direction of the chain at each point in its evolution than on the individual link","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e678f8a9889d47ac5586f52e2c91924ed83acb40","amp;dn":"European+Painting+and+Sculpture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e678f8a9889d47ac5586f52e2c91924ed83acb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,120,248,169,136,157,71,172,85,134,245,46,44,145,146,78,216,58,203,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
