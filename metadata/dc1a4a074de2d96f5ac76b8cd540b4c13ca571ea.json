The random recall is designed to associate words with meanings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1a4a074de2d96f5ac76b8cd540b4c13ca571ea","amp;dn":"PIMSLEUR+HEBREW+-LESSONS+pt.+1%26amp%3B2+%28mp3%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1a4a074de2d96f5ac76b8cd540b4c13ca571ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,26,74,7,77,226,217,111,90,199,107,140,213,64,180,193,60,165,113,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
