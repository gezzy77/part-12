Larry McMurtry epitomizes small-town America and through characters reintroduced in Texasville and DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Depressed, captures the ecstasy and heartbreak of adolescence.The Last Picture Show is one of Larry McMurtry's most memorable novels, and the basis for the enormously popular movie of the same name. Set in a small, dusty, Texas town, The Last Picture Show introduced the characters of Jacy, Duane, and Sonny: teenagers stumbling toward adulthood, discovering the beguiling mysteries of sex and the even more baffling mysteries of love. Populated by a wonderful cast of eccentrics and animated by McMurtry's wry and raucous humor, The Last Picture Show is a wild, heartbreaking, and poignant novel that resonates with the magical passion of youth.\n\n2 - Texasville \nWith Texasville, Larry McMurtry returns to the unforgettable Texas town and characters of one of his best-loved books, The Last Picture Show. This is a Texas-sized story brimming with home truths of the heart, and men and women we recognize, believe in, and care about deeply. Set in the post-oil-boom 1980s, Texasville brings us up to date with Duane, who's got an adoring dog, a sassy wife, a twelve-million-dollar debt, and a hot tub by the pool; Jacy, who's finished playing &quot;Jungla&quot; in Italian movies and who's returned to Thalia; and Sonny -- Duane's teenage rival for Jacy's affections -- who owns the car wash, the Kwik-Sackstore, and the video arcade. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨One of Larry McMurtry's funniest and most touching contemporary novels.\n\n3 - Duane's Depressed\nFunny, sad, full of wonderful characters and the word-perfect dialogue of which he is the master, McMurtry brings the Thalia saga to an end with Duane confronting depression in the midst of plenty. Surrounded by his children, who all seem to be going through life crises involving sex, drugs, and violence; his wife, Karla, who is wrestling with her own demons; and friends like Sonny, who seem to be dying, Duane can't seem to make sense of his life anymore. He gradually makes his way through a protracted end-of-life crisis of which he is finally cured by reading Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, a combination of penance and prescription from Dr. Carmichael that somehow works.\nDuane's Depressed is the work of a powerful, mature artist, with a deep understanding of the human condition, a profound ability to write about small-town life, and perhaps the surest touch of any American novelist for the tangled feelings that bind and separate men and women.\n\n4 - When the Light Goes\nBack from a two-week trip to Egypt, Duane finds he cannot readjust to life in Thalia, the small, dusty, West Texas hometown in which he has spent all of his life. In the short time he was away, it seems that everything has changed alarmingly. His office barely has a reason to exist now that his son Dickie is running the company from Wichita Falls, his lifelong friends seem to have suddenly grown old, his familiar hangout, once a good old-fashioned convenience store, has been transformed into an &quot;Asian Wonder Deli,&quot; his daughters seem to have taken leave of their senses and moved on to new and strange lives, and his own health is at serious risk.\nIt's as if Duane cannot find any solace or familiarity in Thalia and cannot even bring himself to revisit the house he shared for decades with his late wife, Karla, and their children and grandchildren. He spends his days aimlessly riding his bicycle (already a sign of serious eccentricity in West Texas) and living in his cabin outside town. The more he tries to get back to the rhythm of his old life, the more he realizes that he should have left Thalia long ago -- indeed everybody he cared for seems to have moved on without him, to new lives or to death.\nThe only consolation is meeting the young, attractive geologist, Annie Cameron, whom Dickie has hired to work out of the Thalia office. Annie is brazenly seductive, yet oddly cold, young enough to be Duane's daughter, or worse, and Duane hasn't a clue how to handle her. He's also in love with his psychiatrist, Honor Carmichael, who after years of rebuffing him, has decided to undertake what she feels is Duane's very necessary sex reeducation, opening him up to some major, life-changing surprises.\n\n5 - Rhino Ranch\nThe Thalia Finale: Readers have followed the life of Duane through The Last Picture Show, Texasville, DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Depressed, and When the Light Goes .Rhino Ranch, ** the final episode in DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saga, represents the end of an era and is the most unusual and compelling novel in the series. Irony, romance, and cycle of life: Duane comes back from a near-fatal heart attack to discover that his new neighbor has recently opened a rhino preserve on her property. As he watches his world change around him, he reminisces on love affairs past and the missed opportunities he now regrets. Rhino Ranch is a bittersweet and fitting end to this iconic series, a tribute to all of the emotion, hilarity, whimsy, and poignancy that readers have followed across decades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b671afac017761f15a8490ae70bc369d303b31f","amp;dn":"Larry+McMurtry+-+The+Last+Picture+Show+Series+%285+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b671afac017761f15a8490ae70bc369d303b31f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,103,26,250,192,23,118,31,21,168,73,10,231,11,195,105,211,3,179,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
