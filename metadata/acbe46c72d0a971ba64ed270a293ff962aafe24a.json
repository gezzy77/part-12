The smoothness of their grooves and underground culture has always been just a stone's throw away from lounge-lizard heaven. \nWith Mimosa, the band gives in to their Velveeta-smooth cheese urges and delivers a quirky collection of far-out covers and retoolings of their own songs.\nIt's an interesting collection, and works best when they stick to their own material. Reworked originals like &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot; and the excellent &quot;I Can't Get With That&quot; have a great, easy, witty feel not terribly far from the original recordings. Some tracks, like &quot;The Summer Wind,&quot; with the surprising guest Ian McCullough, showcase the band's strong live performances. Others are just plain whacked out, like the ultra-wimpy '70s weepers &quot;I'm Not In Love&quot; and &quot;Shining Star&quot; (not the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song, another one). \nIt seems like they might have taken a miscue from Cake, whose 1996 cover of &quot;I Will Survive&quot; is both hilarious but true to the spunk of the original. These covers lack the irony or campiness needed to make it interesting.
