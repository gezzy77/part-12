It was recorded in Montreux, \nSwitzerland, in November 1973 with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, and released in February \n1974.\n\nIt introduced new lead vocalist David Coverdale and new bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes from Trapeze. \nThis was the first Deep Purple album with the Mark III line-up. With the addition of Coverdale and \nHughes, Purple's hard rock sound became more boogie oriented, incorporating elements of soul and \nfunk which would become much more prominent on the follow-up album, Stormbringer.\n\n&quot;Coronarias Redig&quot; was recorded during these sessions, but not used on the album, appearing as a \nB-side on the &quot;Might Just Take Your Life&quot; single. It appears as a bonus track (in remixed form) on \nthe anniversary edition re-release.\n\n&quot;Might Just Take Your Life&quot; released three days before the album on 12 February, was Deep Purple's \nfirst UK single in two years.\n\n\n   1.
