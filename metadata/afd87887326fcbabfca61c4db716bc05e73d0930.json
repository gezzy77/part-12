Create brooding basslines with new MASSIVE presets. Then add finesse to the power with sampled cinematic ambiences, sound effects, and tempo-synced loops.\n\nA sonic punch as dense as concrete for drum and bass, dubstep, and trap styles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this is RESONANT BLAZE.\n\nThe new sidechaining feature and Plate Reverb in MASCHINE 2.0 add new possibilities not available in MASCHINE 1.8. And a set of tempo-synced loops based on the most famous break in drum and bass add an authentic touch to this advanced expansion.\n\nThe sonic barrage doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop with drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RESONANT BLAZE also comes equipped with a versatile set of exclusive MASSIVE presets. Start by adding thunderous sub-basses to your breaks. Then layer up pads and leads to cover the entire drum and bass spectrum from atmospheric to aggressive.\n\nBest of all, the presets are incorporated right into the kits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lightning-fast production with cutting edge sound and ulitmate tweakability.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd87887326fcbabfca61c4db716bc05e73d0930","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Resonant+Blaze+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd87887326fcbabfca61c4db716bc05e73d0930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,216,120,135,50,111,203,171,252,166,28,77,183,22,188,5,231,61,9,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
