Lorraine's other alter ego, L.L. Bartlett, writes psychological suspense and the Jeff Resnick mystery series.\nShe's done it all, from drilling holes for NASA to typing scripts in Hollywood, and lives a life of crime in western New York.\nHer first sales were to the confession magazine market. In all, she's sold nine short stories, including one on Amazon Shorts.\n\nBooktown Mystery Series\nMurder Is Binding: The streets of Stoneham, New Hampsire are lined with bookstores...and paved with murder.\nWhen she moved to Stoneham, city slicker Tricia Miles met nothing but friendly faces. And when she opened her mystery bookstore, she met friendly competition. But when she finds Doris Gleason dead in her own cookbook store, killed by a carving knife, the atmosphere seems more cutthroat than cordial. Someone wanted to get their hands on the rare cookbook that Doris had recently purchased-and the locals think that someone is Tricia. To clear her name, Tricia will have to take a page out of one of her own mysteries-and hunt down someone who isn't killing by the book.\n\nBookmarked For Death: Tricia Miles, owner of the Haven't Got a Clue bookstore, must solve her own mystery when a bestselling author is found dead in the washroom.\n\nBookplate Special: Bookstore owner Tricia Miles has put up - and put up with - her uninvited college roommate for weeks. In return, Pammy has stolen $100. But the day she's kicked out, Pammy's found dead in a Dumpster, leaving loads of questions unanswered.\n\nChapter and Hearse: Mystery bookstore owner Tricia Miles has been spending more time solving whodunits than reading them. Now a nearby gas explosion has injured Tricia's sister's boyfriend, Bob Kelly, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, and killed the owner of the town's history bookstore. Tricia's never been a fan of Bob, but when she reads that he's being tight-lipped about the &quot;accident&quot;, it's time to take action.\n\nSentenced to Death: As the owner of Stoneham, New Hampshire's mystery bookstore Haven't Got a Clue, Tricia Miles can figure out whodunit in the latest bestseller long before she gets to the last page. But when her friend is killed in a freak accident, Tricia must use her sleuthing skills to solve a murder mystery that promises to be much more sinister than the books on her shelves.\n\n\nMurder on the Half Shelf : Stoneham, New Hampshire, is a haven to bookstores, including TriciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mystery shop, HavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got a Clue, but is sadly lacking in bed and breakfasts. Pippa and Jon ComfortÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sheer Comfort Inn opens its doors to the public in a week and the couple has offered some locals a free night as a trial run.\n\nBut what should have been a pleasant overnight stay for Tricia becomes a nightmare when she makes two startling discoveries: PippaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murdered body in the backyard, and the fact that her husband Jon is actually Harry Tyler, a man Tricia lovedÃ¢â‚¬â€and believed deadÃ¢â‚¬â€for nearly twenty years.\n\nNow Harry is the prime suspect, but Tricia doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe him capable of murder, regardless of her own feelings toward him. And even though HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s led a life of lies, TriciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learning that Pippa had her share of secrets that some people may have not wanted revealedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nNot the Killing Type : ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s November in Stoneham, New Hampshire, and that means itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for the Chamber of Commerce elections. The race is already a bit heated, as the long-standing Chamber president is being challenged by a former loverÃ¢â‚¬â€TriciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own sister, Angelica. Then local small business owner Stan Berry throws his hat in the ring.\n\nUnfortunately, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not there for long when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found murdered in the Brookview Inn. The murder weapon is a brass letter opener belonging to the innÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s receptionist. Tricia knows thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way the receptionist is a killer. And when Angelica asks Tricia to help clear her name and win the election, she sees little choice except to start snooping.\n\nShe soon uncovers a ballot box full of lies and betrayals, and a chamber full of people who had grudges against the victim. But were they serious enough to lead to murder? And who truly had something to gain? Tricia will have to do some serious sleuthing before she pulls the lever on a killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a55508e6af08858f6c5d34d1aead704dffa564","amp;dn":"Booktown+Mystery+series+-+Lorna+Barrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a55508e6af08858f6c5d34d1aead704dffa564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,165,85,8,230,175,8,133,143,108,93,52,209,174,173,112,77,255,165,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
