Using non-technical language and detailed illustrations Charleson shows how achieving structural standards need not limit the scope for architectural innovation and high design standards in seismically active zones.\n\nWith enough theory to satisfy architects without swamping them in technical data, Seismic Design for Architects is a state-of-the-art summary of designing buildings where being prepared for the worst is an everyday fact of life.\n\nSome of highlighted features of this book :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Written for architects, emphasising design over analysis\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Key concepts conveyed with visual material to allow architects to appreciate the design solutions available to them\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Draws experience from a wide variety of national and international design codes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08bfbbbc8df159293381ecbc97b19be80b672c48","amp;dn":"Seismic+Design+for+Architects+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08bfbbbc8df159293381ecbc97b19be80b672c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,191,187,188,141,241,89,41,51,129,236,188,151,177,155,232,11,103,44,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
