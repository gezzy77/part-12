If not, I suggest you get that first.\n\nSame rules follow for the Support Forum and etc. If not sure, please see my signature from previous torrents.\n\nQuick tips:\nAlways look for a batch file. If there is one, run the appropriate one (such as- setup.bat, gamesname.bat, stup.bat etc.)\nIf there is not any batch file, there is nothing to extract.\n\nHere are the games in this release:\nCivilization 4 Colonization [Portable].exe\nHalf-Life 2 Deathmatch.exe\nMidnight Club 2 [Portable].exe\nSerious Sam the First Encounter [Portable].exe\nSerious Sam the Second Encounter [Portable].exe\nSoldier of Fortune 2 Double Helix [Portable].exe\nStronghold Crusader Extreme [Portable].exe\nSWAT4 [Portable].exe\nTeam Fortress 2 [Portable].exe\nTeam Fortress Classic [Portable].exe\nTony Hawks Pro Skater 4 [Portable].exe\nWarhammer 40000 Dawn of War [Portable].exe\n\n\nThis one was a &quot;too many games, too little time&quot; situation. So I could not write any instruction for this. But, if you used the first version of the series, you would know how to work these games.\nAlso, I am not sure how much I will be able to support you guys on these many games. Hopefully, someone will.\n\nLastly, Happy Camping &amp; Keep Seeding :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c6ebdf89a1e93fba14dc762997c48753c71d6e","amp;dn":"%5BPortable%5D+LAN+Games+Repository+3.0.0+%5BFinal%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c6ebdf89a1e93fba14dc762997c48753c71d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,198,235,223,137,161,233,63,186,20,220,118,41,151,196,135,83,199,29,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
