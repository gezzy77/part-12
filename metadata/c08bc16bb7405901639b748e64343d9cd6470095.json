All-in-all, over 50 internationally known recording artists bring their unique bone-crushing slant to these remarkable songs. Produced by Grammy award-winning producer/guitarist Bob Kulick and ace engineer Brett Chassen, \\&quot;Butchering The Beatles\\&quot; features 12 new, a**-kicking versions of The Beatles\\&amp;#039; chart-topping hits including \\&quot;Hey Jude,\\&quot; \\&quot;I Feel Fine,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Day Tripper,\\&quot; plus the more esoteric \\&quot;Hey Bulldog,\\&quot; barked out by the legendary Alice Cooper and \\&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows,\\&quot; uniquely interpreted by the iconic Billy Idol, alongside classic concept songs like \\&quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\&quot; and \\&quot;Magical Mystery Tour.\\&quot;\n\nWhen asked by Guitar Player magazine what possessed him to go all metal on The Beatles, Bob Kulick stated that, \\&quot;Beatles songs are the Holy Grail. They\\&amp;#039;re the best rock songs ever written. These new recordings are totally faithful, yet completely different. Billy Gibbons singing \\&amp;#039;Revolution\\&amp;#039; or (Motorhead bassist) Lemmy singing \\&amp;#039;Back In The USSR\\&amp;#039; are not exactly Paul McCartney or John Lennon. And of course, the guitar solo sections were lengthened to accommodate all the artists\\&amp;#039; solo styles.\\&quot;\n\nEnjoit!!.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08bc16bb7405901639b748e64343d9cd6470095","amp;dn":"Butchering+the+Beatles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08bc16bb7405901639b748e64343d9cd6470095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,139,193,107,183,64,89,1,99,155,116,142,100,52,61,156,214,71,0,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
