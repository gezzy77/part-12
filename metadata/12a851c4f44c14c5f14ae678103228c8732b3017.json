Their first official material was released in 1983, when the band did not practice an extreme metal sound yet.\n\nVULCANO always playing metal very different from the other Brazilian bands of the period, what made them a quite unique heavy music act. This fact, although in delayed form, was recognized at the right time.\n\nDuring the period when the band stayed inactive, a total of 14 years during all its history, they were never forgotten by their true and loyal audience, over this long period of inactivity, without any public apparition, a common band could, easily, have been forgotten, but VULCANO, along with other Brazilian extreme metal bands, have ultimately influenced, directly,\n\nThe arise during the late 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s of a new intense metal scene/style: The Norwegian Black Metal, with all itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fury and violence, was the responsible for give a new breath to the extreme metal music market.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nZhema Rodero Guitars\nArthur Von Barbarian Drums\nLuiz Carlos Louzada Vocals\nIvan Pellicciotti Bass\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nBloody Vengeance (1986)\nAnthropophagy (1987)\nWho Are The True (1988)\nRatrace (1990)\nTales From The Black Book (2004)\nAnthropophagy + Devil On My Roof (2005)\nFive Skulls And One Chalice (2009)\nDrowning In Blood (2011)\nThe Man The Key The Beast (2013)\nLive II Stockolm Stormed (2014)\nWholly Wicked (2014)\n\n\n\nWholly Wicked (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
