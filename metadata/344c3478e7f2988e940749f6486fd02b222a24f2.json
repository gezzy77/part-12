Good candidates for aging are high-alcohol brews, bottle-conditioned beers with yeast in the bottle, barleywines, lambics, and winter ales. Patrick Dawson explains how to identify a cellar-worthy beer, how to plan and set up a beer cellar, what to look for when tasting vintage beers, and the fascinating science behind the aging process. He also includes a comprehensive buying guide to help you select already-aged beers (from the readily available to the tantalizingly rare) to enjoy as your own collection is aging.\n\n\nBy Patrick Dawson\nPublished by Storey Publishing in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 160 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:344c3478e7f2988e940749f6486fd02b222a24f2","amp;dn":"Vintage+Beer+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"344c3478e7f2988e940749f6486fd02b222a24f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,76,52,120,231,242,152,142,148,7,73,246,72,111,208,43,34,42,36,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
