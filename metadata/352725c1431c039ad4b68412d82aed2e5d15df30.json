The song, &quot;Nona&quot; is a tribute to Nikki Sixx' grandmother, who died during the recording of the album.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Wild Side&quot;   \t\t4:40\n2. \t&quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;  \t4:30\n3. \t&quot;Dancing on Glass&quot;   \t4:18\n4. \t&quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot;    \t3:27\n5. \t&quot;Nona&quot;   \t \t1:27\n6. \t&quot;Five Years Dead&quot;    \t3:50\n7. \t&quot;All in the Name Of...&quot; 3:39\n8. \t&quot;Sumthin' for Nuthin'&quot; \t4:41\n9. \t&quot;You're All I Need&quot;   \t4:43\n10. \t&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; (Live)\t4:39\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352725c1431c039ad4b68412d82aed2e5d15df30","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+1987+-+Girls+Girls+Girls+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352725c1431c039ad4b68412d82aed2e5d15df30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,39,37,193,67,28,3,154,212,182,132,18,216,42,237,46,93,21,223,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
