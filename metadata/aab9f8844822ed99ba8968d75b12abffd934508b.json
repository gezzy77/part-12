With the 1998 release of their first LP, Orange Rhyming Dictionary, Jets to Brazil took the expectations of their peers and turned them on their heads, surprising most with their breed of music that is fresh and excitingly powerful. As the bandmembers continue to move away from their namesakes and become more comfortable with their expanding sound, the world could see something quite intriguing evolve. Jets to Brazil followed up with Four Cornered Night in August 2000. Two years later, the band returned with their darkest, most inspirational material to date; Perfecting Loneliness appeared on Jade Tree in October 2002 and reflected mega-tight musicianship from the band. \n\nAll albums at a tasty 320 kbps.\n\nOrange Rhyming Dictionary - 1998\n\nCrown of the Valley\nMorning New Disease\nResistance Is Futile\nStarry Configurations\nChinatown\nSea Anemone\nLemon Yellow Black\nConrad\nKing Medicine\nI Typed for Miles\nSweet Avenue\n\nFour Cornered Night - 2000\n\nYou're Having The Time Of My Life\nOne Summer Last Fall\nAir Traffic Control\nPale New Dawn\nIn The Summer's When You Really Know\nEmpty Picture Frame\nLittle Light\nYour X-Rays Have Just Come Back From The Lab And We Think We Know What Your Problem Is\nMilk and Apples\nMid-Day Anonymous\n*******\nOrange Rhyming Dictionary\nAll Things Good And Nice \n\nPerfecting Loneliness - 2002\n\nThe Frequency\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The One I Want\nCat Heaven\nPerfecting Loneliness\nLucky Charm\nWish List\nPsalm\nAutumn Walker\nFurther North\nWilliam Tell Override\nDisgrace\nRocket Boy ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab9f8844822ed99ba8968d75b12abffd934508b","amp;dn":"Jets+to+Brazil+-+Discography+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab9f8844822ed99ba8968d75b12abffd934508b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,185,248,132,72,34,237,153,186,137,104,215,91,18,171,255,217,52,80,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
