The few survivors wander the barren land either trying to avoid roving gangs of violent thugs that terrorize the land, joining the nation headed by the Fist of the North Star (a powerful and mysterious warlord), or falling victim to one or the other. A lone wanderer, Ken, travels the land searching for his lost love, Julia, but he knows that she is still with the man who took her from him--his own brother. Meanwhile, another powerful warrior, Rao, watches and waits for the moment to strike with his armies and claim the shattered remains of earth for his own. There can be no winner in this battle, but one thing is for certain: there's going to be a bloody lot of mayhem before the dust settles.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113074/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113074/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e3fc4d640a3af9f1600b2cba79409a1c22a337","amp;dn":"Fist.Of.The.North.Star.1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e3fc4d640a3af9f1600b2cba79409a1c22a337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,227,252,77,100,10,58,249,241,96,11,44,186,121,64,154,28,34,163,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
