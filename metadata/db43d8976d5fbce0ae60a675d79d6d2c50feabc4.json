They had only one goal -Bruno Groening.\nFor many it was the last hope. Beaten down by war, given up by the physicians, these people had only one wish - to become well, to be freed from misery and pain. Bruno Groening should help them. &quot;The Phenomenon Bruno Groening&quot; traces the dramatic events of the time, proceeding on the trail of this unusual man.\n\n\nP.S.
