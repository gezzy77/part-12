We were already living in tents so it wasn&amp;#039;t a deliberate act. How did we end up in a tent?

We appreciate light and want to know more about it. How does artificial light shape your daily mood? How does natural light make you feel? Living in a tent by a stream, we listened to endangered coho salmon swimming upstream when dozing off. A reclamation of what you react to helps to shape your life.

If you roll a doobie, then you react to a doobie....&quot;\n\n\n::::: Brightblack Morning Light - [Self-Titled] 2006 - 192 Kbps :::::\n\n1. Everybody Daylight\n2. Friend of Time\n3. Fry Bread\n4.
