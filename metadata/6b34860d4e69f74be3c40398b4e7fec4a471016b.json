For Hannah Shapiro, a beautiful young American student, this particular nightmare began eight years ago in Los Angeles, when Jack Morgan, owner of Private - the world's most exclusive detective agency - saved her from a horrific death. She has fled her country, but can't flee her past. The terror has followed her to London, and now it is down to former Royal Military Police Sergeant Dan Carter, head of Private London, to save her all over again. In central London, young women are being abducted off the street. When the bodies are found, some days later, they have been mutilated in a particularly mysterious way. Dan Carter's ex-wife, DI Kirsty Webb, is involved in the investigation and it looks likely that the two cases are gruesomely linked. Dan Carter draws on the whole resources of Private International in a desperate race against the odds. But the clock is ticking...Private may be the largest and most technologically advanced detection agency in the world, but the only thing they don't have is the one thing they need - time. James Patterson's white-knuckle rollercoaster has just reached London. Buckle up, it's one hell of a ride.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b34860d4e69f74be3c40398b4e7fec4a471016b","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+private+london","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b34860d4e69f74be3c40398b4e7fec4a471016b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,52,134,13,78,105,247,75,227,196,3,152,180,231,254,196,164,113,1,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
