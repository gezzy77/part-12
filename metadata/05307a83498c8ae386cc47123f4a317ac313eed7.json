From the concert pianist who progressively lost the ability to recognize objects (including musical scores) yet managed to keep performing from memory, to the writer whose stroke disturbed his ability to read but not his ability to write (he used his experience to write a novel about a detective suffering from amnesia), to Sacks himself, who suffers from &quot;face blindness,&quot; a condition that renders him unable to recognize people, even relatives and, sometimes, himself (he once confused a stranger's face in a window with his own reflection), Sacks finds fascination in the strange workings of the human mind. Written with his trademark insight, compassion, and humor, these seven new tales once again make the obscure and arcane absolutely absorbing.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05307a83498c8ae386cc47123f4a317ac313eed7","amp;dn":"The+Mind%27s+Eye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05307a83498c8ae386cc47123f4a317ac313eed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,48,122,131,73,140,138,227,134,204,71,18,63,74,49,122,195,19,238,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
