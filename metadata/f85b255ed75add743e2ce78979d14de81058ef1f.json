TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MCSE tests against a broader-than-ever set of technologies, from Windows Server itself to the entirety of System Center. But you already know that. MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 70-414 exam is the fifth and final hurdle between you and your MCSE: Server Infrastructure certification. \n\nCongratulations! The road to get here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as all those nights of studying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has surely been long. \n\nHaving gotten this far, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already experienced with installing and configuring Windows Server 2012. You know how to administer it. You also know how to configure its advanced services, and design and implement a server infrastructure with the aid of System Center. \n\nBut this exam is different. \n\nMicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 70-414 exists as the capstone to your entire certification effort. This exam doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much ask Ã¢â‚¬Å“what to doÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Ã¢â‚¬Å“when to do it.&quot; Indeed, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get a few questions about Windows Server 2012 and System Center configurations, but the 70-414Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s primary goal is proving you know when to implement Microsoft technologies. \n\nTo help you prep for an exam like this, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve brought in one of our big guns. Veteran CBT Nuggets instructor Greg Shields has passed over 30 IT exams in his career. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been an MCSE almost as long as thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been an MCSE, and he knows his way around Microsoft certification. That deep and broad experience is why weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve asked him to produce our 70-414 MCSE: Server Infrastructure capstone training. \n\nIn this exam prep series, Greg speaks directly to MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exam objectives. He explains each objective in common sense terms, whiteboarding architectures where appropriate while demoing configurations when a little extra attention might be necessary. This training is no MCSE braindump. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a targeted study guide thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you a wiser Windows Server administrator while tightly focusing on your 70-414 study efforts. \n\nGood luck with that final step towards Microsoft MCSE certification. With GregÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be ready to prove not only that you know Ã¢â‚¬Å“what to doÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in solving IT problems, but also Ã¢â‚¬Å“when to do it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85b255ed75add743e2ce78979d14de81058ef1f","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+MICROSOFT+WINDOWS+SERVER+2012+70-414+-+Abdallah+Salm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85b255ed75add743e2ce78979d14de81058ef1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,91,37,94,215,90,221,116,62,44,231,137,121,209,77,232,16,88,239,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
