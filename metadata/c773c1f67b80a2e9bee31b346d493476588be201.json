And it remains one of her great loves among Greek and Roman writings.\nAn Exceptional Teacher\n\nIf you've enjoyed any of Professor Vandiver's previous courses on the epics of Homer and Virgil, Greek tragedy, or classical mythology, you will surely want to add this one to your library of recorded learning.\n\nIf you are new to Professor Vandiver or The Teaching Company, however, this course is still a great investment in learning.\n\nShe presents the material to you as a self-contained unit that is readily accessible and requires no special background knowledge.\n\nHerodotus (c. 484ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“420 B.C.E.) was a Greek who was born in what is now the modern Turkish resort town of Bodrum (called Halicarnassus, in his day) and who died, so tradition says, in the south of Italy.
