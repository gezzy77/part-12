Obviously it is a scan. Don't worry, it isn't images, it's text alright. Mainly it's totally fine, but there are some minor problems.\n\n1. Some of the last pages, mainly in Appendix D and the Chapter Notes, come in the wrong order.\n\n2. Some PDF viewers (PDF-XChange viewer) show five of the figures/images all streaky while they are fine in others (Foxit). In two cases the corrupt image covers the text below. Those images and the obscured texts are included in the download.\n\nApart from the above my only contribution is that I have created a bookmark table of contents. Thanks to the anonymous original uploader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6870982558eca33bb5a38c4ef5883e64fde19e7","amp;dn":"Know+Your+Fats+%28Mary+Enig+2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6870982558eca33bb5a38c4ef5883e64fde19e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,135,9,130,85,142,202,51,187,90,56,196,239,88,131,230,79,222,25,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
