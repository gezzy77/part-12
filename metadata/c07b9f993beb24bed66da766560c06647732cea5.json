It also provides a comprehensive treatment of key issues of modern-day coupling reactions having emerged and matured in recent years and emphasizes those topics that show\npotential for future development, such as continuous flow systems, water as a reaction medium, and catalyst immobilization, among others.\nWith its inclusion of large-scale applications in the pharmaceutical industry, this will equally be of great interest to industrial chemists.\n\nFrom the contents\n_ Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A General Introduction\n_ High-turnover Heterogeneous Palladium Catalysts in Coupling Reactions:\nthe Case of Pd Loaded on Dealuminated Y Zeolites\n_ Palladium-Catalyzed Coupling Reactions with Magnetically Separable Nanocatalysts\n_ The Use of Ordered Porous Solids as Support Materials in Palladium-Catalyzed\nCross-Coupling Reactions\n_ Coupling Reactions Induced by Polymer-Supported Catalysts\n_ Coupling Reactions in Ionic Liquids\n_ Cross-Coupling Reactions in Aqueous Media\n_ Microwave-Assisted Synthesis in CÃ¢â‚¬â€œC and CÃ¢â‚¬â€œHeteroatom Coupling Reactions\n_ Catalyst Recycling in Palladium-Catalyzed CarbonÃ¢â‚¬â€œCarbon Coupling Reactions\n_ Nature of the True Catalytic Species in CarbonÃ¢â‚¬â€œCarbon Coupling Reactions with\nHeterogeneous Palladium Precatalysts\n_ Coupling Reactions in Continuous Flow Systems\n_ Large-Scale Applications of Palladium-Catalyzed Couplings in the Pharmaceutical Industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c07b9f993beb24bed66da766560c06647732cea5","amp;dn":"Palladium-Catalyzed+Coupling+Reactions+Wiley+2013+%28Chemistry%29+%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c07b9f993beb24bed66da766560c06647732cea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,123,159,153,59,235,36,190,214,109,167,102,86,12,6,100,119,50,206,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
