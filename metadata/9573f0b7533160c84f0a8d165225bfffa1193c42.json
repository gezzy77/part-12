He presents the results of his statistical analysis of crime data for every county in the United States during 29 years from 1977 to 2005. The book examines city, county and state level data from the entire United States and measures the impact of 11 different types of gun control laws on crime rates. The book expands on an earlier study published in 1997 by Lott and his co-author David Mustard in The Journal of Legal Studies. Lott also examines the effects of gun control laws, including the Brady Law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9573f0b7533160c84f0a8d165225bfffa1193c42","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+More+Guns%2C+Less+Crime+-+Understanding+Crime+and+Gun+Contr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9573f0b7533160c84f0a8d165225bfffa1193c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,115,240,183,83,49,96,200,79,10,141,22,82,37,191,255,161,25,60,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
