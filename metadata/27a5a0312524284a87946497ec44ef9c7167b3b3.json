The reason, evidently, is that time is more important than anything else except life itself. But what, essentially, is it? Einstein did not give us the philosophical interpretation of space-time. That is a task for the philosophers. Samuel K. K. Blankson, the Ghanaian philosopher, gives one of the most lucid and logical interpretations of what Einstein called 'time, pure and simple'. The strange and extremely technical phenomenon known as 'time dilation', which inspired Einstein to discover his special theory of relativity, is lucidly explained. The reader will find the answer simple and most surprising, and, it is hoped, satisfactory too.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.lulu.com/browse/product_thumbnail.php?productId=4786223&amp;resolution=320&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.lulu.com/browse/product_thumbnail.php?productId=4786223&amp;resolution=320&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a5a0312524284a87946497ec44ef9c7167b3b3","amp;dn":"TIME+IN+SCIENCE+AND+LIFE+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a5a0312524284a87946497ec44ef9c7167b3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,165,160,49,37,36,40,74,135,148,100,151,236,68,239,156,113,103,179,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
