McKenzie Lewis can track them, reading the shadows they leave behind. But some shadows lead to danger. Others lead to lies.\n\nA Houston college student trying to finish her degree, McKenzie has been working for the fae king for years, tracking vicious rebels who would claim the Realm. Her job isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t her only secret. For just as long, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in love with Kyol, the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sword-masterÃ¢â‚¬â€and relationships between humans and fae are forbidden.\n\nBut any hope for a normal life is shattered when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s captured by Aren, the fierce and uncompromising rebel leader. He teaches her the forbidden fae language and tells her dark truths about the Court, all to persuade her to turn against the king. Time is running out, and as the fight starts to claim human lives, McKenzie has no choice but to decide once and for all whom to trust and where she ultimately stands in the face of a cataclysmic civil war.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0f675a86495b6cfa2f032e92fdb0703c0e5c04","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+Reader+by+Sandy+Williams+%28McKenzie+Lewis+01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0f675a86495b6cfa2f032e92fdb0703c0e5c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,15,103,90,134,73,91,108,250,47,3,46,146,253,176,112,60,14,92,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
