GuthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s startling theoryÃ¢â‚¬â€widely regarded as one of the most important contributions to science during the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€states that the big bang was set into motion by a period of hyper-rapid Ã¢â‚¬Å“inflation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lasting only a billion-trillion-billionth of a second. The Inflationary Universe is the passionate story of one leading scientistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effort to look behind the cosmic veil and explain how the universe began.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbce60cba6ca21c943223838452a408cd50b2b8","amp;dn":"The+Inflationary+Universe.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecbce60cba6ca21c943223838452a408cd50b2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,188,230,12,186,108,162,28,148,50,35,131,132,82,164,8,205,80,178,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
