The Wampanoag's ancestors ensured the survival of the Pilgrims in New England, and lived to regret it. Nevertheless, through resilience and courage they kept their identity alive and remained on their ancestral lands. Now a cultural revival is taking place.\r\nThe story begins in 1994 when Jessie Little Doe, an intrepid, 30-something Wampanoag social worker, began having recurring dreams: familiar-looking people from another time addressing her in an incomprehensible language. Jessie was perplexed and a little annoyed - why couldn't they speak English? Later, she realized they were speaking Wampanoag, a language no one had used for more than a century.\r\nThese events sent her and members of the Aquinnah and Mashpee Wampanoag communities on an odyssey that would uncover hundreds of documents written in their ancestral language, lead Jessie to a earn herself a masters degree in linguistics at MIT, and result in something that had never been done before - bringing a language alive again in an American Indian community after many generations with no native speakers. With commitment, study groups, classes, and communitywide effort, many are approaching fluency. Jessie's young daughter Mae is the first native speaker in more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/We-Still-Live-Here-As-Nutayunean-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2646 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 23.976 fps\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\r\n * Audio Quality: 0.48 48KHz (~140 Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 55mn 42s\r\n * Part Size: 1.09 GiB\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Released: 2011\r\n * Source: HDTV MPEG2 1080i (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Merged Subtitles: English\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/we-still-live-here/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925efb31aab34631729b7e292efbd2d12cfe1a65","amp;dn":"PBS+Independent+Lens+2011+We+Still+Live+Here+As+Nutayunean+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925efb31aab34631729b7e292efbd2d12cfe1a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,94,251,49,170,179,70,49,114,155,126,41,46,251,210,209,44,254,26,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
