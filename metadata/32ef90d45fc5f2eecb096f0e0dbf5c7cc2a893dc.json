Entertaining in themselves, the stories also show that history is not merely living, but lively. The reader who comes to the book thinking history is boring will leave with a changed outlook with regard to both the subject matter and the process of writing history.\n\nEach chapter is a carefully and thoroughly researched presentation not of popularized accounts but of valid historical scholarship. Chronologically arranged, the essays show the historical process in action. For each disputed historical point, theories arise, become standard wisdom, and then are revised as additional information becomes available. This book reveals the mechanics of that process, including spirited debate, swashbuckling archaeology, and the application of modern science to ancient questions.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-History-From-Prehistory-Present/dp/1851098992/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344194744&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=mysteries+in+history+aron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-History-From-Prehistory-Present/dp/1851098992/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344194744&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=mysteries+in+history+aron&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ef90d45fc5f2eecb096f0e0dbf5c7cc2a893dc","amp;dn":"Mysteries+in+History%3A+From+Prehistory+to+the+Present","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ef90d45fc5f2eecb096f0e0dbf5c7cc2a893dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,239,144,212,95,197,242,238,203,9,111,14,13,191,92,124,194,168,147,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
