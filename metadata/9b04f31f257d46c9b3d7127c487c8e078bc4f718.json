His son John, an economics genius, never lost a cent in the stock marketÂ—or any other financial dealÂ—and was investigated for insider trading on more than one occasion. Now Cat, a documentarian; her researcher, Mercy; and Cracker Jack, an electronics whiz, are doing a film about the Granville clan. What they find as they research the family is madness, suicide, a seemingly total seclusion, and a frightening glimpse about what it means to peer into the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b04f31f257d46c9b3d7127c487c8e078bc4f718","amp;dn":"Kate+Wilhelm-The+Fullness+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b04f31f257d46c9b3d7127c487c8e078bc4f718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,4,243,31,37,125,70,201,179,215,18,124,72,124,142,7,139,196,247,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
