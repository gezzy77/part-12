The white Southern California duo were an established journeyman doo wop/R&amp;B act before an association with Phil Spector produced one of the most memorable hits of the 1960s, &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.&quot; The collaboration soon fell apart, though, and while the singers had some other excellent hit singles in a similar style, they proved unable to sustain their momentum after just a year or two at the top.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-righteous-brothers-p5274/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-righteous-brothers-p5274/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nBest of the Righteous Brothers is a ten-track budget-priced collection that features some of the Righteous Brothers' biggest hits, including &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',&quot; &quot;(You're My) Soul and Inspiration,&quot; &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; and &quot;Little Latin Lupe Lu.&quot; Although this isn't a bad budget-priced disc, there are far better Righteous Brothers collections available, offering more songs and better sound for not much more money.\n\nOld AMG Review\nby Andrew Hamilton\n\nSkimpy, only 10 selections, but each a soulful essential including early rockers - &quot;Little Latin Lupe Lu,&quot; &quot;My Babe,&quot; and their five greatest recordings: &quot;You Lost That Lovin' Feelin',&quot; &quot;(You're My) Soul And Inspiration,&quot; and stirring renditions of &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; and &quot;Georgia On My Mind.&quot; Bobby Hatfield's high tenor is the perfect foil to Bill Medley's resonant baritone on combination leads, and each stand alone masterfully on solos.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/unchained-melody-curb-main-entry-r48007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/unchained-melody-curb-main-entry-r48007&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000CX2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000CX2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
