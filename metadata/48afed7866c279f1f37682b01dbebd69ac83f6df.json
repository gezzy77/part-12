This epic boasts a stellar cast including Sir Lawrence Olivier, Ernest Borgnine, Christopher Plummer, and James Mason. Robert Powell gives what could be the defining performance of his acting career. His likeness to paintings and portraits of Christ are almost eerie in its exactness. His range from the serene to the indignant Christ who knocks over the money-changer's tables is a contrast in great acting. It is obvious by watching Powell that he had done his homework and knew exactly who he was imitating.\n\nThe film stays closely on track with the gospels although it does vary in some minute ways. One scene in which it strays is when Nicodemus comes to Christ during the day, when the gospel of John clearly says it was at night. One can only speculate if the beautiful scenery in Morocco had anything to do with this decision. But the attention to detail and truth permeate this picture and it is not stretching it to say it is lovingly made by director Franco Zeffirelli. This film is for the entire family, although parents of young children should be warned it includes the spearing of some zealots, though not graphically shown, and the violence of Jesus' crucifixion, tame compared to the recent &quot;The Passion Of The Christ.&quot; This depiction of the life of Jesus of Nazareth has yet to be matched by any other film.\n\nContent Chart &amp; Description\n\nContent ScaleSexLanguageViolenceDrugs &amp; AlcoholNudityOther\nSexLanguageViolenceDrugsNudityOther\n\nSex: Mary Magdalene portrayed as a prostitute at first.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
