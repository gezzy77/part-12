For his first release in nearly two years he forgoes his long-favoured sample-based manipulations in favour of synthesis-based techniques, weaving a unique polymetric blend of Shangaan-alike percussive timbre, Chicago-style percolations and floating choral voices with the deft precision of a Lancashire loom worker making a tapestry of otherworldly visions. A-side, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFreezing Opening ThawingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ locks into a spiralling vortex of modulating percussive hooks and swirling melodic patterns punctuated by blasts of white noise to temper its careening momentum. B-side he arranges supple, light-footed bass pulses with dreamier synth notes and darting drums on Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhite Flower with Silvery EyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and casts the intricate, mercurial weft of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSilver KeysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Still, nobody sounds quite like Shackleton.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c3aa66ce988f0e435fc02cfa95d2f9a62f5b0ec","amp;dn":"Shackleton+%26ndash%3B+Freezing+Opening+Thawing+%28Woe+To+The+Septic+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c3aa66ce988f0e435fc02cfa95d2f9a62f5b0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,58,166,108,233,136,240,228,53,252,2,207,169,93,47,154,98,245,176,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
