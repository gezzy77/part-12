It is the first album since Wages of Sin (2001) to feature a new line-up, with Alissa White-Gluz on vocals after former long-time vocalist Angela Gossow stepped down from vocal duties to be the band's business manager, and Nick Cordle on guitars who replaced Christopher Amott in 2012.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Background and development\n    2 Artwork\n    3 Promotion\n    4 Track listing\n    5 Personnel\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \t&quot;I was looking for a hand-drawn feel with a unique atmosphere, something that would complement the music that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been working so hard on these last couple of years. In the end my choice fell upon Romanian artist Chioreanu Costin, who's work IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve admired for some time. Costin really grasped my vision for the artwork and layout, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivered some of the coolest artwork elements we've ever had with Arch Enemy!\tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nPromotion\n\nThe first single and music video &quot;War Eternal&quot; was released on March 20, 2014.
