Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows fuses fantasy fighting action with the strategic RPG collecting and customization elements for solo play, co-op and an online community.\n\nCenturies ago, four immortal heroes set out to kill the most powerful emperor their age had ever known. They failed, and for their crimes, three were crucified on a great tree at the bottom of the world. Mysteriously set free, the heroes set out to finish what they had started, only to find that they must now save their tormentor from his own dreams and madness. If the ancient heroes cannot undo the emperor's deeds on their own, his mad plans may tear apart the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48bd5860fbe1cb9f3460ae72c5c751381c4c4e1a","amp;dn":"Gauntlet%3A+Seven+Sorrows+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48bd5860fbe1cb9f3460ae72c5c751381c4c4e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,189,88,96,251,225,203,159,52,96,174,114,197,199,81,56,28,76,78,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
