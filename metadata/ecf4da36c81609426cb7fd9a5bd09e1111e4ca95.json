On Mother's Day 1999, Mark, a young drifter with an interest in endangered loggerhead turtles, begins a relationship with motel handyman George. On Mother's Day 2000, Mark's adoptive mother Elizabeth wonders what has become of her estranged son. On Mother's Day 2001, Mark's birth mother Grace quits her job to begin a search for the child she gave up years before-a search that ultimately brings the stories together. Written by Eric Sorensen \n\n\n \nThis isn't a tidy little movie with a predictable end, predictable characters nor scriptÃ¢â‚¬â€ rather this is a compelling, profoundly moving film refreshing in how delicate it is. The performances are nuanced and the dialogue and story lines have a verisimilitude that left me feeling touched by the characters. They felt &quot;real.&quot; That is rare in any filmÃ¢â‚¬â€ that quality where you stop watching actors and start watching characters and feel their pain, hopes, dreams. I only saw this movie by accident as my boyfriend and I got to the theater to see another film which happened to be sold out and seats were available for this film. Lucky for me.  kate-449 \n \n\nCan't say enough about this film 7/10.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf4da36c81609426cb7fd9a5bd09e1111e4ca95","amp;dn":"Loggerheads+%282005%29+Gay+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf4da36c81609426cb7fd9a5bd09e1111e4ca95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,244,218,54,200,22,9,66,108,183,253,154,91,208,158,17,17,228,202,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
