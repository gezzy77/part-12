One of the dates from this tour was captured on film, and Black &amp; Blue: Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult Live features these two veteran bands at the top of their game. Black Sabbath (featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Tony Iommi on guitar, Geezer Butler on bass, and Vinnie Appice on drums) perform &quot;Iron Man,&quot; &quot;War Pigs,&quot; &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; &quot;NIB,&quot; and more, while Blue Oyster Cult (in their classic lineup of Eric Bloom on lead vocals and guitar, Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser on lead guitar, Allen Lanier on keyboards and guitar, Joe Bouchard on bass, and Albert Bouchard on drums) play &quot;Godzilla, &quot;&quot; Cities on Flame With Rock and Roll, &quot;&quot; The Marshall Plan, &quot;&quot; Dr. Music, &quot;and more. ~\n\n\n- Black Sabbath -\n\n01.
