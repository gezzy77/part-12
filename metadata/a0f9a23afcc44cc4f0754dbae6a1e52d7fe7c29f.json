Firestorm has the ability to rearrange the atomic and subatomic structure of matter, rearranging subatomic particles to create objects of different atomic characteristics of equal mass.\n\nThe first Firestorm series was short-lived, cancelled abruptly in a company-wide cutback (the &quot;DC Implosion&quot;) with #5 (the first part of a multiple-issue story) the last to be distributed, and #6 included in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade. Writer Conway added Firestorm to the roster of Justice League of America. This led to a series of 8-page stories in the back of The Flash (with art by George PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rez), and a revival of a monthly Firestorm comic in 1982. The Fury of Firestorm (later called Firestorm: the Nuclear Man) lasted from 1982 until 1990.\n\nThe original Firestorm was distinguished by his integrated dual identity. High school student Ronnie Raymond and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Martin Stein were caught in a nuclear accident that allowed them to fuse into the &quot;nuclear man&quot; Firestorm. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures.  After the accident that created him, Firestorm took to defending New York from such threats as Multiplex (created in the same nuclear accident that produced Firestorm) and Killer Frost. The 1982 series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the nuclear arms race and FirestormÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role as an &quot;elemental.&quot; \n\nFollowing the events of Indentity Crisis a new Firestorm series began in 2004, written by Dan Jolley with art by Chris Cross, with a new character, Jason Rusch, in the role. Like his predecessors, Jason had a sense of humor which he often used to hide his insecurities.  \n\nJason was a seventeen-year-old living in Detroit, who wanted nothing more than to escape his home city. He lived with his father, who had turned abusive after he lost his hand in an industrial accident. His mother left his father sometime after the accident, leaving the young Jason with his father.  While working for a local gangster he encounters the Firestorm matrix. In the aftermath of gaining the powers of Firestorm, Jason struggled to cope with his new identity and powers.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0f9a23afcc44cc4f0754dbae6a1e52d7fe7c29f","amp;dn":"Firestorm+V1%2C+V2+and+v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0f9a23afcc44cc4f0754dbae6a1e52d7fe7c29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,249,162,58,252,196,76,196,240,117,77,186,230,161,229,45,127,231,194,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
