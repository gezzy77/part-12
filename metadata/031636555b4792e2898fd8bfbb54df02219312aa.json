As with those releases, it was produced by Dawn Atkinson and features many of the same artists. The results are as varied as the musicians. Violinist Tracy Silverman cuts one of his patented echo-delayed pizzicato violin arrangements of a Bach arioso, while Patrick O&amp;#039;Hearn drapes a somber keyboard shroud around the Adagio from Rodrigo&amp;#039;s Fantasy for a Gentleman. Jeff Johnson and Brian Dunning find the Celtic air in the Adagio from Handel&amp;#039;s Sonata in G, while Philip Aaberg discovers infinity between the notes of Barber&amp;#039;s ubiquitous Adagio for Strings. He stretches the melody across his piano in finely drawn lines, subtlety filled out with synthesizer undertones. Subtlety is a casualty on Philipe Saisse&amp;#039;s bongos, bells, and synth arrangement of Bach&amp;#039;s Air on a G String. It&amp;#039;s also sacrificed in a corny confection of Handel&amp;#039;s Sarabande by Paul Schwartz. His ham-fisted electronic keyboards would&amp;#039;ve sounded dated even before Switched-On Bach. But Adagio features plenty of musicians who are willing to surrender themselves to their elegiac themes, including guitarist Steve Erquiaga, Mike Marshall, and Edgar Meyers.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n        \n1.
