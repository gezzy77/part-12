His family gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain his marriage to a radiantly beautiful actress; his nineteen-year-old daughter, Petra, filled with voices and visions as she waits for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose relations with the Godley children are strained at best; and PetraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“young manÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€very likely more interested in the father than the daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€who has arrived for a superbly ill-timed visit.\n\nBut the Godley family is not alone in their vigil. Around them hovers a family of mischievous immortalsÃ¢â‚¬â€among them, Zeus, who has his eye on young AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife; Pan, who has taken the doughy, perspiring form of an old unwelcome acquaintance; and Hermes, who is the genial and omniscient narrator: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We too are petty and vindictive,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he tells us, Ã¢â‚¬Å“just like you, when we are put to it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As old AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s days on earth run down, these unearthly beings start to stir up trouble, to sometimes wildly unintended effect. . . .\n\nBlissfully inventive and playful, rich in psychological insight and sensual detail, The Infinities is at once a gloriously earthy romp and a wise look at the terrible, wonderful plight of being humanÃ¢â‚¬â€a dazzling novel from one of the most widely admired and acclaimed writers at work today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004a7203ac10f655ee381b67592cb1ea0a4a70f8","amp;dn":"The+Infinities+-+John+Banville.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004a7203ac10f655ee381b67592cb1ea0a4a70f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,74,114,3,172,16,246,85,238,56,27,103,89,44,177,234,10,74,112,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
