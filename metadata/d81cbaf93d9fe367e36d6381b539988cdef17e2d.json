The band gained a modest audience with its debut album, but it was the platinum-selling sophomore effort A Beautiful Lie that officially opened the flood gates in 2005, securing the band a frequent presence on MTV while paving the way for a number of successful tours. By placing all-access passes into 12 copies of the album, the bandmates also showed a savvy appreciation for marketing, which they revisited several years later by putting fans' photographs on the cover of their third album, This Is War.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t24583-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.78% CDDA &amp; 99.88% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Kings And Queens\n02.Attack\n03.Edge Of The Earth\n04.This Is War\n05.100 Suns\n06.Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\n07.The Kill (Bury Me)\n08.Hurricane\n09.A Beautiful Lie\n10.Buddha For Mary\n11.Closer To The Edge\n12.From Yesterday\n13.End Of The Beginning\n14.Night Of The Hunter\n15.R-Evolve\n16.Welcome To The Universe\n17.Search And Destroy\n18.Was It A Dream\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Escape\n02.The Fantasy\n03.Echelon\n04.Vox Populi\n05.Fallen\n06.Battle Of One\n07.The Mission\n08.Alibi\n09.Hunter\n10.Oblivion\n11.Stranger In A Strange Land\n12.The Story\n13.93 Million Miles\n14.Savior\n15.L490\n16.A Modern Myth\n17.Year Zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It!****\n\n                 ****Enjoy! &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d81cbaf93d9fe367e36d6381b539988cdef17e2d","amp;dn":"30+Seconds+To+Mars+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d81cbaf93d9fe367e36d6381b539988cdef17e2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,28,186,249,61,159,227,103,227,109,99,129,181,57,152,140,222,241,126,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
