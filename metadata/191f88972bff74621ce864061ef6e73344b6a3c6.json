Denvir does an excellent job of breaking down the myth of movements linearly following one after another, and shows how artists were competing, collaborating, and warring over their ideologies (or lack thereof). One of the books I re-read every year.\n\nGoodreads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:191f88972bff74621ce864061ef6e73344b6a3c6","amp;dn":"Post-impressionism+by+Bernard+Denvir+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"191f88972bff74621ce864061ef6e73344b6a3c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,31,136,151,43,255,116,98,28,232,100,6,30,246,231,51,68,182,163,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
