The album served as Milian's debut album in the U.S., partly in due to the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before the release date of her debut album. For the production of the album, Milian worked with Bloodshy &amp; Avant, Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, Cory Rooney, Warryn Campbell, Bryan Cox and Poli Paul.\n\nThe album peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart and number 21 in the United Kingdom, selling a total of 382,000 and 63,708 copies respectively. The album achieved Silver certification in the UK, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. The album's lead single, &quot;Dip It Low&quot;, became Milian's most successful to date; peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. The second single &quot;Whatever U Want&quot; was less successful, peaking on the UK singles chart at number nine.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] Dip It Low\t\t\t- Featuring Fabolous\n[03] I Need More\t\t\t- Featuring Joe Budden\n[04] Whatever U Want\n[05] Someday One Day\n[06] Highway\n[07] Get Loose\n[08] I'm Sorry\n[09] L.O.V.E.\t\t\t- Featuring Joe Budden\n[10] Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly\n[11] Miss You Like Crazy\n[12] Oh Daddy\n[13] I Can Be That Woman\n[14] Hands On Me \n\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] [2004] Christina Milian - Dip It Low [21mb]\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:50m:26s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 153mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- Mpeg\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 13 July 2004\n\nRecord Company\t\t- The Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.christinamilian.org \n\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/christinamilian\n\t\t\t- http://www.miliantalk.com/ \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For The Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00ae2e771aa693ae3e514fd94ec5ee06b90475e3","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+Its+About+Time+-+Christina+Milian+-153mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00ae2e771aa693ae3e514fd94ec5ee06b90475e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,174,46,119,26,166,147,174,62,81,79,217,78,197,238,6,185,4,117,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
