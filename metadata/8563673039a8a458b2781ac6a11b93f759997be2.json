The group&amp;#039;s name is an acronym for Erick and Parrish Making Dollars (later ducats), referencing its members, emcees Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith ( &quot;PMD&quot; ). Diamond J, DJ K La Boss, and DJ Scratch were DJs for the group. EPMD used to stand for Erick and Parrish Making Dollars, but they changed it to Erick and Parrish Millennium Ducats prior to the release of its latest album, titled Out of Business in 1999. The word &quot;Business&quot; is used in every title of the groupÃƒÂ¢??s albums. Around the time the two had a falling out, their latest album was titled Business Never Personal. When they united once again, it was Back in Business. Every album also has a track titled ÃƒÂ¢??Jane.ÃƒÂ¢??\n\n\nEPMD&amp;#039;s first album, Strictly Business, appeared in 1988, spawning the massive underground hit &quot;Strictly Business,&quot; sampling Eric Clapton&amp;#039;s version of Bob Marley&amp;#039;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff.&quot; Many critics see its first album as its most influential. The group&amp;#039;s brand of funk-fueled sample-heavy hip-hop proved to be a major force in the genre. Unlike old school hip hop, which was first based on disco hits but eventually became more electronic, EPMD based its music mainly on lifting funk and rock breaks for samples and helped to popularize their usage, along with Marley Marl and Public Enemy. &quot;You&amp;#039;re a Customer&quot; combined snippets of Steve Miller&amp;#039;s &quot;Fly Like an Eagle,&quot; Kool &amp; the Gang&amp;#039;s &quot;Jungle Boogie,&quot; and the bass line from ZZ TopÃƒÂ¢??s &quot;Cheap Sunglasses.&quot; &quot;Jane,&quot; about a romantic rendezvous turned bad, would be revisited on no less than five sequels; a first for hip-hop, and, perhaps, rock and roll as well. &quot;You Gots to Chill&quot; used 1980s funk band Zapp&amp;#039;s &quot;More Bounce to the Ounce,&quot; which has become one of the most enduring sample sources for hip-hop. &quot;I&amp;#039;m Housin&amp;#039;&quot; was covered some 12 years later by Rage Against the Machine. Managed early on by Russell Simmons&amp;#039; RUSH Management, the group toured with such hip-hop luminaries as Run-DMC, Public Enemy, and DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince.\n\n\nStrictly Business was the debut album by hip-hop duo EPMD. It is considered a classic hip-hop album, getting a 5-mic rating from The Source magazine (one of 43 albums ever to be given this rating). In 1998, the album was selected as one of the Source Magazine&amp;#039;s 100 Best Hip-Hop Albums. In 2003, the album was ranked number 459 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.. It is ranked the 916th best album of all time by Acclaimedmusic.net [1] It was one of three titles acquired by Priority/EMI Records when Sleeping Bag Records ceased operations in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1 &quot;Strictly Business&quot; \n2 &quot;I&amp;#039;m Housin&amp;#039;&quot; \n3 &quot;Let The Funk Flow&quot;  \n4 &quot;You Gots To Chill&quot; \n5 &quot;It&amp;#039;s My Thing&quot;  \n6 &quot;You&amp;#039;re A Customer&quot; \n7 &quot;The Steve Martin&quot; \n8 &quot;Get Off The Bandwagon&quot; \n9 &quot;D.J.
