Read this book and start to de-stress by getting back in tune with the natural time of things - not a clock.\n\nBuddha Standard Time is a book that everyone who thinks they are so busy they have no time to even stop and enjoy a sunrise or sunset should read. It includes guides to help readers start living in the present moment and to enjoy things that they really want to do. It doesn't promise to expand your 24 hour day into 48 hours, but if you start practicing some of the steps and meditations, you may just find yourself with extra time in the day so you can start enjoying your &quot;time&quot; once again.\n\nOverall, I found that the exercises are quite helpful in learning how to meditate and reconnect with nature. I highly recommend this book to everyone who needs help de-stressing and enjoying the time in a day again.\n\n* Thank you to the publisher of Buddha Standard Time, Harper One, for providing me with a copy of this book for review.
