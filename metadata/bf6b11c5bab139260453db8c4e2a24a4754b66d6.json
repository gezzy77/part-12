This is for testing the effectiveness of different settings.\n\n\nThis design is untested, if you build it please post your results!\nFile contains all STL files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6b11c5bab139260453db8c4e2a24a4754b66d6","amp;dn":"Nitinol+Heat+Motor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6b11c5bab139260453db8c4e2a24a4754b66d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,107,17,197,186,177,57,38,4,83,219,140,78,42,36,164,117,75,102,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
