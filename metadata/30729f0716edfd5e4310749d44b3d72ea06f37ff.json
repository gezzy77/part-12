And what a potpourri of influences it is, even covering such luminaries as Raymond Radus and Ed Leedskalnin, plus inventors you may not have even heard of.\n\nFor those that attended, here is the opportunity to refresh your memory as to what was presented and re-live the moment.  And for those of you that didn't attend, here is your opportunity to hear the presentation from a front row seat, as the event was filmed with four cameras.\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30729f0716edfd5e4310749d44b3d72ea06f37ff","amp;dn":"Energy+from+the+Vacuum+-+PART+22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30729f0716edfd5e4310749d44b3d72ea06f37ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,114,159,7,22,237,253,94,67,16,116,157,68,179,215,46,160,111,55,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
