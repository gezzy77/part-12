Norsk Rocks Historie Vol. 6: Progressiv Rock 1971-1977\n\nA very good compilation. Highly recommended !\n\n\nReview from shindig-magazine.com\n\nThe History of Norwegian Rock Volumes 1-6 (NRK; CDs)\n\nSweden and Denmark have had and continue to enjoy a copious reissue programme of their sixties musical output. By comparison, Norway has been ill served. Only the excellent double LP 'Raveyard Paradise' has really made it's way beyond the national border and left me for one, \nwanting more. The NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Company) have done here, what EMI did in Sweden with the three CD Stora Popboxen set some years back, in anthologising the countries rock history. I have currently volumes three, four and six in this series. These comprise of beat and garage (many featured on Raveyard Paradise, but are here cut from the masters in superb sound quality) on volume three, club/mod soul moves and progressive pop with a touch of psych on four and, to my ears, the best of all three in the progressive music on volume six. All three collections are sung in English. There are additionally a rock'n'roll volume, a folk volume (sung in Norwegian I believe) and a rock volume. All collections come with colour booklets which whilst written in Norwegian, have plenty of colour picture sleeve and artist photos.\n\n\nVolume three sports 29 tracks, a suitably long play disc for short beat songs featuring such acts as The Clinkers, Jan Groth &amp; His Voodoos, Bente Lind &amp; The Lunic Group, The Hugger Muggers and the oddly named ****Cats. The music ranges from standard covers of the day ('No,No,No', 'Shakin' All Over', 'Watch Your Step') to interesting originals in Zak's 'Take Speical Care', The Wizards' 'See You Tonight' and The Meswick Group's 'She Won't Sing'. Great sound quality makes this a winner for beat fans. Volume four is subtitled R&amp;B and Psych. The R&amp;B via blue eyed soul is present and correct, if a little flat at times and the band names and song titles tell their own story; The Rhythmic Six's 'Action', Little Earl &amp; The Sapphires' 'Night Trippes', The Public Enemies' 'Believe Me'. There are then some more progressive (but not really psych) numbers such as UFO's 'Jumbo', Dream's 'Night Of The Lonely Organist And His Pals' and the most psychedelic number on offer in Hippie's 'Marianne'. This twenty tracker is a pleasurable listening experience but not that essential. Volume six is subtitled Progressive and it is that of course, but in a very positive way. Very little noodling going on here. All 18 tracks have something of value to offer and there are some blinders on here in the form of Prudence's 'Tomorrow Maybe Vanished', Titanic's 'Sea Wolf', Ruphus's 'Colored Dreams', Popol Vuh's 'Queen of All Queens' or Hole In The Wall's 'Restless Man'. These songs are a sort of prog-psych crossover in many instances and most are comparible to such vinyl comps as Star Girl And Spaceman and Here Lies Ebenezer Goode. \nYou may want to try asking around the usual mail order sources for these discs as the NRK web site is only in Norwegian. They're worth persevering for though!\n\n\n[img]http://www.mmmll.no/thm/collection/mno/images/48482f.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://www.mmmll.no/thm/collection/mno/images/48304f.jpg[/img]\n\n\nSize: 649 MB\nTracker: http://tracker.prq.to/announce\n192kbps\nHigh quality scans of all artwork &amp;
