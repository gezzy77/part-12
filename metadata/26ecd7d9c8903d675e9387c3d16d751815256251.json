Not everyone on the Death Star wants to be the EmpireÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minion; some might just want to work at the local ice cream shopÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFUEL THE EMPIREÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S EVIL SCHEMES UNDERGROUND: Below the hustle and bustle of the businesses above, build secretive, underground imperial levels to craft special supplies that will aide your Imperial troops in the fight against the Rebels.\n\nCAPTURE REBEL SPIES: As stealthy as your Death Star development may be, expect break-ins from Rebel spies such as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and more!
