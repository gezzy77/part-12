It has been repeatedly tested in a course on personal decision making. The approach of the book is unabashedly practical. Except for portions of the second chapter, the emphasis is consistently on what to do. What the second chapter does is provide a brief overview of basic cognitive processes and the ways in which they tend to limit decision quality and also a brief explanation of the basic decision aids and the ways in which each supplements basic cognitive processes to enhance rationality, creativity, or judgmentthe &quot;three secrets&quot;. Some understanding of why the techniques are needed and how they work should enable the reader to apply them with greater effectiveness and satisfaction.\n\nMathematicians, economists, psychologists, and practitioners have developed a variety of powerful and easily applied tools for decision making. Evidence is accumulating that better decision processes lead to better outcomes and that unaided human decision processes are not good enough for many decisions. More to the present point, evidence is also accumulating that learning better decision processes can make people better decision makers in their daily lives. The Three Secrets of Wise Decision Making brings the best of the new methods to the intelligent reader.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab02225ec491c446a909a8d09d2861cd090c6534","amp;dn":"The+Three+Secrets+of+Wise+Decision+Making-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab02225ec491c446a909a8d09d2861cd090c6534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,2,34,94,196,145,196,70,169,9,168,208,157,40,97,205,9,12,101,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
