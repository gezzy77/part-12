A female backing chorus even appears on one track. Among several lesser-known Fogerty songs (&quot;Pagan Baby,&quot; &quot;Sailor's Lament,&quot; &quot;It's Just a Thought&quot;) were two top-ten hits, &quot;Hey Tonight&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;. Both songs reached number eight in 1971. It also contains their only avant-garde venture &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot;.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f85aeda3459dff8a4164301d57e81730fc595019","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+%5C%27Pendulum%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f85aeda3459dff8a4164301d57e81730fc595019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,90,237,163,69,157,255,138,65,100,48,29,87,232,23,48,252,89,80,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
