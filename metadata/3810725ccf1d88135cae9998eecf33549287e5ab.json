In Afghanistan, Pilger investigates the claim that life has improved for the women of Iraq now that the Taliban have gone. In Washington, he interviews leading American officials, 'neo-cons' in the Bush regime. John Bolton, of the State Department, now the US Ambassador to the United Nations, says he regards the figure of 10,000 civilian deaths in Iraq as 'quite low'. Breaking the Silence won a number of awards, and was nominated for a BAFTA, a British Academy Award. \n\nAlso check out my other torrents on America's pseudo-democracy such as the BBC documentary 'How to Kill a Human Being' about the death penalty in the 'Land of the Free' and Aaron Russo's documentary on America's utterly corrupt financial system the results of which should be evident to even the most bloody minded by now.\n\nAlso watch Richard Dawkins' refutation of America's greatest delusion: Christianity, in whose name the 'War on Terror' is really being fought (Bush claims &quot;God told him to invade Iraq&quot;).\n\nFurthermore, don't miss Pat Condell's excellent commentaries on Christianity, Islam and derailed American politics as well as Michael Moore's documentaries on the sad state of American democracy ('Fahrenheit 9/11', 'Sicko', 'Bowling for Columbine', etc.) and ex-presidential candidate Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth' about the destruction of the planet by greedy corporations and the corrupt governments who serve them.\n\nIf you have any doubt about America's descent into fascism, read American journalist Amy Goodman's book: THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULERS or visit her website: http://www.democracynow.org/ or other progressive websites such as http://www.commondreams.org/ or http://www.projectcensored.org/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3810725ccf1d88135cae9998eecf33549287e5ab","amp;dn":"Breaking+the+Silence+by+John+Pilger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3810725ccf1d88135cae9998eecf33549287e5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,16,114,92,207,29,136,19,92,174,153,152,238,207,51,84,146,135,229,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
