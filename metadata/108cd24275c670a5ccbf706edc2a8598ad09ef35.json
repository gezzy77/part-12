At some point during the thread the subject of John Foxx&amp;#039;s Radio 1 sessions was raised.  It transpired that Foxx had recorded no fewer than four radio sessions for Radio 1 between 1983 and 1985.  It was decided to gather all these sessions together into one collection and distribute it amongst metamatic.com regulars.\n\nIn order to facilitate the distribution of the tracks I offered to create a BitTorrent of the tracks and offer the music to a wider audience.  This download consists of those sessions tracks, plus some other radio interviews and a few rare Foxx tracks.\n\nCredits and thanks:  Andreas (Shadowman) for creating the original collection, Garry (RadioBeach) for additions and Cerise for getting it all together and sending me the copy from which this Torrent has been created.\n\nPlease distribute this collection as you please but please do not sell it.\n\nHarold Halloway\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n--------------\n\nCD 1\n\nRadio 1, December 1983\n1.
