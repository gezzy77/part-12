A complex figure, he was champion of the poor and brutal tyrant, poet and despot.\n\nPantsov and Levine show MaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relentless drive to succeed, vividly describing his growing role in the nascent Communist Party of China. They disclose startling facts about his personal life, particularly regarding his health and his lifelong serial affairs with young women. They portray him as the loyal Stalinist that he was, who never broke with the Soviet Union until after StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.\n\nMao brought his country from poverty and economic backwardness into the modern age and onto the world stage. But he was also responsible for an unprecedented loss of life. The disastrous Great Leap Forward with its accompanying famine and the bloody Cultural Revolution were MaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creations. Internationally Mao began to distance China from the USSR under Khrushchev and shrewdly renewed relations with the U.S. as a counter to the Soviets. He lived and behaved as ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last emperor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab69edd6ece72d699770064966f9054b69e70d9","amp;dn":"Mao+-+The+Real+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab69edd6ece72d699770064966f9054b69e70d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,182,158,221,110,206,114,214,153,119,0,100,150,111,144,84,182,158,112,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
