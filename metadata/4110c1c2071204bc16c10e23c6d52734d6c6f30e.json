Lucille Ball gets much more than she bargained for as she gets set up with weirdo after weirdo, but she seems pretty game for everything. A different Lucy than what I'm familiar with.\n\nBoris' part isn't particularly extensive.  It is George Sanders who plays the male lead, though there are plenty of men paraded before us.\n\nApparently it was also known as &quot;Personal Column&quot; as the distributors thought the audience might confuse &quot;lured&quot; with &quot;lurid&quot;.  This is post code, so the audience would be disappointed, even today, were they to confuse the two terms.\n\nI don't know if this was filmed in England, as Lucille Ball plays the only American character, and it is set in London.  It was a US production.\n\nUncompressed NTSC DVD5 VIDEO_TS files\n\nI kept the original disk label, for humor's sake...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4110c1c2071204bc16c10e23c6d52734d6c6f30e","amp;dn":"Douglas+Sirk+-+Lucille+Ball+-+Boris+Karloff+-+Lured+%281947%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4110c1c2071204bc16c10e23c6d52734d6c6f30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,16,193,194,7,18,4,188,22,193,14,35,198,213,39,52,214,198,243,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
