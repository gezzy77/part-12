The fact that Sigfasson did not only write all the music but also was doing most of the recording and production promises a lot for his future and Summer Echoes conveys the feeling that the real story has only just begun. Asian edition includes two bonus tracks.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Easier  (03:11), 6.23 MB\n02. Bruises  (02:36), 5.41 MB\n03. Fall Down Slow  (04:23), 8.52 MB\n04.
