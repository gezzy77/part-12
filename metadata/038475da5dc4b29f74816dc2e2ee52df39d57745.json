Boimes now-indispensable erudition and scholarship are always accessible and enjoyable, fostering a sense of the readers participation in this art historical journey toward explanations of a social and cultural order increasingly familiar to us now in ours. \n\nFrom the European revolutions of 1848 through the Italian independence movement, the American Civil War, and the French Commune, the era Albert Boime explores in this fourth volume of his epic series was, in a word, transformative. The period, which gave rise to such luminaries as Karl Marx and Charles Darwin, was also characteriz- by civic upheaval, quantum leaps in science and technology, and the increasing secularization of intellectual pursuits and ordinary life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038475da5dc4b29f74816dc2e2ee52df39d57745","amp;dn":"Art+in+an+Age+of+Civil+Struggle%2C+1848-1871+A+Social+History+of+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038475da5dc4b29f74816dc2e2ee52df39d57745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,132,117,218,93,196,178,159,116,129,109,194,226,238,82,223,57,213,119,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
