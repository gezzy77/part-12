His finds that his home city is like many across Europe and the world, it's facing hard economic times and fallout from the global economic crisis, rioting and looting almost a nightly occurrence as youth unemployment inexorably rises. His Auntie Jane, who has taken up residence in their run down council house, dulls her stagnation with welfare funded booze and disturbing attempts to sexually gratify herself by trying to seduce him. Navigating his way across this new landscape he meets a young student who needs his helps. However his act of kindness brings him into contact with a lawless drug dealing pimp and a race against time to make peace with his mother and get out of town as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n01:18:43\n720x400\n25 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c6cdc93d2577db9c9559a56699160e7353f253","amp;dn":"2013+Cal+%28UK%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c6cdc93d2577db9c9559a56699160e7353f253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,198,205,201,61,37,119,219,156,149,89,165,102,153,22,14,115,83,242,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
