My aim is to make skype open source. And find friends who can spend many hours for completely reverse it.\n\nNow, most of hard things already done(for 1.x/3.x/4.x versions of skype). Including rc4 and arithmetic compression.\n\nYou have unique chance to take a look on skype internal protocol and encryption. You will see what it uses strong AES and RSA encryption with public key infrastructure.\n\nHere is yet a working &quot;send message to skype&quot; code. However, this is based on old skype 1.4 version protocol, which now slightly changed.\n\nPart of this code, idb files and decrypted binares was get from VEST corporation.\n\nCommon info for first stage research was from EADS.net &quot;vanilla-skype&quot; presentation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d93c83f807d8b88a4ba4108730caf3e7d6209fb","amp;dn":"Skype+protocol+reverse+engineered%2C+source+available+for+download","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d93c83f807d8b88a4ba4108730caf3e7d6209fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,147,200,63,128,125,139,136,164,186,65,8,115,12,175,62,125,98,9,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
