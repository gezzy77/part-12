Increasingly strict stormwater regulations and the appeal of LEED-related projects have also boosted the popularity and desirability of green roofs. Those who want to build green roofs, however, have few resources to guide them. Until now, no book has taken a comprehensive look at how to effectively adapt green-roof technology to the variable and extreme North American climate, and how to design projects that will function and endure as successfully as those in Germany, Switzerland, and other European countries.\n\nThis book fills the gap by providing an overview of practices and techniques that have been effective in North America. The authors offer options regarding structure, function, horticulture, and logistics, as well as surveys of actual projects and analyses of why they have or havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t succeeded. Approachable and reader-friendly, the manual clearly explains how these complex systems function and how to plan and carry out projects successfully from concept through construction and maintenance. Ideally suited to professionals (including architects, landscape architects, engineers, and designers) and their clients, it brings together key lessons from leaders in the field. Numerous photographs highlight the range of design possibilities and show green roofs both during construction and at various stages of maturity.\n\nAt last, those seeking basic information about how to design and build green roofs have a concise, authoritative guide to this exciting new technology.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 296 pages\n    * Publisher: Timber Press (August 11, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9781604690491\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1604690491\n    * ASIN: 1604690496","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0077d74c5c5786c507a2fd814faa32d0e46e5093","amp;dn":"The+Green+Roof+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0077d74c5c5786c507a2fd814faa32d0e46e5093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,119,215,76,92,87,134,197,7,162,253,129,79,170,50,208,228,110,80,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
