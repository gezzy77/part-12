He's released five years later when a witness named Delong appears and provides an alibi. Rocky then sets out to find who framed him, hoping that by uncovering the actual criminals, he'll be able to free his friend Danny Morgan, also accused of the same crime.\n\nDelong is lying about the alibi. What he really wants is a share of the missing robbery loot. Rocky insists he wasn't involved. They go see Morgan's wife, Nancy, a former love of Rocky's, who now lives in a trailer park.\n\nPolice Lt. Gus Cobb keeps an eye on Rocky because he's still convinced of his guilt. Rocky believes that bookie Louis Castro is the mastermind. He demands $50,000 at gunpoint. Castro won't agree to that, but gives him $500 to bet on a fixed horse race.\n\nShots are fired at Delong and girlfriend Darlene near the trailer and she is killed. Nancy believes the intended victims were Rocky and herself. Rocky goes back to Castro and plays Russian roulette until Castro reveals where the robbery money can be found. It turns out Morgan was indeed involved and that Nancy now has his share.\n\nLt. Cobb gradually comes to believe Rocky's innocence. Nancy says she loves him and invites him to run off together with the loot, but Rocky leaves her for the law.\n\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nThe film was shot in the Bunker Hill section of the city (the &quot;Crosley&quot; Hotel, built as the Nugent, and stood at 3rd and Grand. Los Amigos bar was at 3rd and Olive. Clover Trailer Park, wasn't on Bunker Hill, but was at 650-700 N Hill Place in Chinatown.\n\nWhen the film was first released the staff at Variety magazine liked the film and said, &quot;All the ingredients for a suspenseful melodrama are contained in Cry Danger...Robert Parrish, erstwhile film editor, makes a strong directorial bow.\n\nMore contemporary, Time Out's on-line magazine review says: &quot;...it's the kind of movie in which, told to expect someone extra for dinner, delicious Fleming smiles 'OK, I'll put more water in the soup'. With excellent support players like a young, thin (for him) William Conrad and Jay Adler, this is a fast, crisp and laconic delight.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 6325 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 79 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e80015234f09e9e676fe2dbf0c0e799a08bc031","amp;dn":"Cry+Danger+%281951%29+Untouched+DVD5+-+Dick+Powell%2C+Rhonda+Fleming+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e80015234f09e9e676fe2dbf0c0e799a08bc031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,128,1,82,52,240,158,158,103,111,226,219,240,192,231,153,160,139,192,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
