But violence and death aren't the only hardships. As Perry struggles to find virtue in himself and his comrades, he questions why black troops are given the most dangerous assignments, and why the U.S. is even there at all.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction | War ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152ac3315f7270fcbb4e7a7d24fa41ce33ba9b2d","amp;dn":"Fallen+Angels+By+Walter+Dean+Myers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152ac3315f7270fcbb4e7a7d24fa41ce33ba9b2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,42,195,49,95,114,112,252,187,78,122,125,36,250,65,206,51,186,155,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
