The show has been the launching pad for such comedians as Dante, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Sommore, and Rodney Perry.\n\nIn the show's later years, the show moved to different cities, such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami and New Orleans. The episodes aired during the 2005-2006 season were filmed in New Orleans less than a month before Hurricane Katrina. Before the show aired, a message dedicated the show to the citizens of New Orleans. Its recent incarnation entitled ComicView: One Mic Stand began in September 2008 with actor Kevin Hart as the host. Dante won more ComicView awards than any other comedian in history.\n\nD.L.
