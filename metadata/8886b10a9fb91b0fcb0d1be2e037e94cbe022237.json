Earlier records have the wide-screen psychedelic sound of first-wave desert rock, while later releases tended more towards traditional Country rock.\n\n1 Keith Can't Read   3:22 \n2 Rock N Roll Disease   3:08 \n3 Morning Blue   3:58 \n4 Zombie for Love   3:53 \n5 Broken Radio   3:52 \n6 Change   5:01 \n7 Tenderloin   5:02 \n8 Way Back Home   2:29 \n9 D.T.

Sure once the newness worth off, it didn't quite thrill me as much but I like it all the same. Things start off in a kind of rockin' Stones style, which is o.k. but I have to admit I like the more country rock flavored sounds which recall Highway  61 Dylan, Dream Syndicate, Meat Puppets, Neil Young and did I say the Rolling Stones already? Not bad.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8886b10a9fb91b0fcb0d1be2e037e94cbe022237","amp;dn":"Green+on+Red...Here+Comes+the+Snakes%281988%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8886b10a9fb91b0fcb0d1be2e037e94cbe022237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,134,177,10,159,185,27,15,203,13,27,226,224,55,233,76,190,2,34,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
