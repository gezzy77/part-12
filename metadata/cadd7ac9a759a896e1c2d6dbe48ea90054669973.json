Farmer, &quot;Groups and Symmetry: A Guide to Discovering Mathematics&quot;\nEnglish | 1995 | ISBN: 0821804502 | PDF | 102 pages | 11,3 mb\n\nIn most mathematics textbooks, the most exciting part of mathematics--the process of invention and discovery--is completely hidden from the reader. The aim of Groups and Symmetry is to change all that. By means of a series of carefully selected tasks, this book leads readers to discover some real mathematics. There are no formulas to memorize; no procedures to follow. The book is a guide: Its job is to start you in the right direction and to bring you back if you stray too far. Discovery is left to you. &lt;P&gt;Suitable for a one-semester course at the beginning undergraduate level, there are no prerequisites for understanding the text. Any college student interested in discovering the beauty of mathematics will enjoy a course taught from this book. The book has also been used successfully with nonscience students who want to fulfill a science requirement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cadd7ac9a759a896e1c2d6dbe48ea90054669973","amp;dn":"Groups+and+Symmetry%3A+A+Guide+to+Discovering+Mathematics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cadd7ac9a759a896e1c2d6dbe48ea90054669973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,221,122,201,167,89,168,150,225,194,214,219,228,142,169,0,84,102,153,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
