Same artist, same title, different song!\n* Gillette - Sex Tonight. I'm not sure if this was one of the last 20 Fingers numbers or was separated.\n* Rochelle - Praying for an Angel. Rochelle was 15 when she recorded this freestyle track. 20 Fingers was left off the label.\n\n++++++++\nNot for the politically correct! 20 Fingers was the Chicago-based production company run by Charlie Babie Rosario and Manfred Mohr in the '90s. They were responsible for a bundle of novelty dance songs in the mid 1990s, notably Gillette's dis song, &quot;Short Dick Man&quot;.\n\nIf you lived or visited Chicago around 1993-1995, the radio stations, street-flavor clothing stores and the clubs were *infested*. Locals like Gillette and Max-A-Million were featured vocalists, as were Charlie Babie and Manny themselves on some. They also produced Rochelle with their name left off the label, likely because Rochelle was 15 and all parties wanted her not associated with 20 Fingers' usual raunchy fare.\n\nIncluded here are tracks not found on the Compilation disc, I had these lying around. How cute, an extra belly button!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e308f8bbe86b8463ed4b0dec539a73212338b49","amp;dn":"20+Fingers+compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e308f8bbe86b8463ed4b0dec539a73212338b49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,48,143,139,190,134,184,70,62,212,176,222,197,57,167,50,18,51,139,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
