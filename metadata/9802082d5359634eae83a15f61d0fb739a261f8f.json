It covers ~115,000 sq mi (~300,000 sq km) reaching from Oregon's Klamath Basin south all the way to Monterey Bay and east across the Sierra Nevada mountains to Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Basin. Major urban areas include Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Stockton, and Fresno as well as a wide variety of landscapes -scenic coastlines, oak covered rolling hills, expansive agricultural areas, high mountains, volcanic peaks and lava flows, large wetlands and dry lakes. Every single square mile of landclass is hand placed and all major roads, railroads, rivers, lakes, powerlines, wind farms, and vertical obstructions are included for accurate VFR flying. More than two dozen key areas are featured with seasonal photoreal coverage and fully annotated with autogen plus custom models of landmark structures, iconic bridges, buildings, and hydro dams.
