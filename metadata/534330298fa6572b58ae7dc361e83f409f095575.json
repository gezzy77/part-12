Is better to teach that good deeds indeed are the measure of\na good soul, rather than what some fundamentalist Christian churches lead their\nfollowers to believer instead - that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not your deeds but gods own grace\nbased on some other measure that  saves you. (As long as you believe the story\nof Christ and accept this - thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all you need as some say) Nonsense - anyone\nthat is truly with a spiritual conviction of real merit will show it by the proof\nof the lives they wish to lead - not the substitute membership in some club \ninstead - where such proof isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t required for some reason it would seem. \nPerhaps I got it wrong.\n\n\nOn the other hand, what are the good deeds required of Moslems according to \ntheir own teachings? If the killing of the priests without just enough cause\nas seen in this movie isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t an anathema to any idea of good deeds, then we have\na definition that is to my own mind rather self-serving for some that would\nmisuse religious interpretations of spiritual ideas - and devoid of meaning\nin objective sense to what is fair enough humanist ideology in his respect.\nOn the other hand, no one would claim such killings as religiously motivated\nin fact. Its simply alienation from one another that causes this unjustifiably\nhowever - for those of real conscience and meritedly so.\n\nUltimately the message of White material and &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot; is the same.\nThe people of France Germany Italy etc are naive to think they can do any\nbetter than to stay away from such efforts in those regions where they \nare unwelcome for lack of any real chance of ever achieving understanding\nthat goes beyond the intervals of time when whatever mutual tolerance there\nis, is feigned - pending inevitable conflict between those involved that are\nalien to one another's being ultimately and  this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a gap that can be bridged\nby any idea of bold seeming yet naive pioneers as it were - or anyone else\nI daresay. There are enough that need social conditions improved within\nour own EU borders and within other poorer European countries that\nare in in need - rather than going off elsewhere with scarce talent of\nreally rightly caring people and resources generally, at this point in time.\nWhy not Eastern Germany mainly? (Charity begins at home eh!)\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmoviesbyrizzo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:534330298fa6572b58ae7dc361e83f409f095575","amp;dn":"Of+Gods+and+Men+%282010%29+720p+DivX+H.264+%28moviesbyrizzo%29+multisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"534330298fa6572b58ae7dc361e83f409f095575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,67,48,41,143,166,87,43,88,174,125,195,97,232,63,64,159,9,85,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
