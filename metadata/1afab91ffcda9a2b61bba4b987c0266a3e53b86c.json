A veteran of\nshort-lived, little-known bands including Herrenvolk, Madame X, V05 and Kid\nWikkid, he was living in Canada when in 1987 he received a demo tape from an\nunknown New Jersey band in search of a lead singer; the group was Skid Row,\nformed a year earlier by ex-Bon Jovi guitarist Dave &quot;Snake&quot; Sabo. Signing to\nAtlantic, Skid Row issued its self-titled debut album in 1989; an opening slot\non Bon Jovi's U.S. tour, combined with heavy MTV airplay of the video &quot;Youth\nGone Wild,&quot; launched the band to stardom, and the singles &quot;18 and Life&quot; and &quot;I\nRemember You&quot; both reached the Top Ten. Bach, with his wildman persona and\nphotogenic looks, quickly emerged as the focus of fan and media attention, a\nsituation compounded in late 1989 when, during a concert in Springfield, MA, he\nwas hit in the head by a bottle thrown onstage; the singer proceeded to hurl the\nbottle back into the crowd, where it hit the face of an innocent girl, before\nphysically assaulting another audience member as well. Sentenced to three years\nprobation, Bach then appeared on MTV wearing an offensive T-shirt emblazoned\nwith the slogan &quot;AIDS Kills Fags Dead,&quot; prompting outcries from the gay\ncommunity. Despite the bad publicity, Skid Row's second album, 1991's Slave to\nthe Grind, debuted at number one, although it quickly fell off the charts; in\nthe wake of 1995's disappointing Subhuman Race, Bach was dismissed from the\ngroup, briefly forming a band with ex-Breeder Kelley Deal before going solo in\n1997. The album Bring 'Em Bach Alive arrived two years later, followed by a live\nDVD (Forever Wild) in 2004 and Angel Down in 2007.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afab91ffcda9a2b61bba4b987c0266a3e53b86c","amp;dn":"Sebastian_Bach-Angel_Down-2007-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afab91ffcda9a2b61bba4b987c0266a3e53b86c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,250,185,31,252,218,154,43,97,187,164,185,135,192,38,106,62,83,184,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
