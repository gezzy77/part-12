W. Singer explores the greatÃ‚Â­est revolution in military affairs since the atom bomb: the dawn of robotic warfare. We are on the cusp of a massive shift in military technology that threatens to make real the stuff of I, Robot and The Terminator. Blending historical evidence with interviews of an amazÃ‚Â­ing cast of characters, Singer shows how technology is changing not just how wars are fought, but also the politics, economics, laws, and the ethics that surround war itself. Traveling from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to modern-day &quot;skunk works&quot; in the midst of suburbia, Wired for War will tantalize a wide readership, from military buffs to policy wonks to gearheads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f6059c0b2d4391b1d388bfd96b0040d969cebc","amp;dn":"Wired+for+War%3A+The+Robotics+Revolution+and+Conflict+in+the+21st+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f6059c0b2d4391b1d388bfd96b0040d969cebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,246,5,156,11,45,67,145,177,211,136,191,217,107,0,64,217,105,206,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
