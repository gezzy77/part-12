Continue seeding after download.  Leave feedback. \n\t\n\t[b]Getting Started[/b] (after install)\n            1. Only on first startup, you may want to password-protect the account. \n            2.

Drive by Downloads.  A drive by download occurs without your awareness simply by browsing an infected site.  The malware scans your computer for outdated software, and if found infects your PC. The best way to protect yourself is to use latest Java Runtime Environment, JRE 6 update 29 or later, and Google Chrome which is 10 fold more secure than Internet Explorer.  Do not use Internet Explorer except for Government/Professional websites if needbe.  Malware can easily infect Internet Explorer on Windows XP.\n\n[b]Flashboot 2.1F[/b]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e03b22baf1f4450ed90f048b230330a85b175f","amp;dn":"Micro+XP+Pro+0.98+New+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e03b22baf1f4450ed90f048b230330a85b175f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,224,59,34,186,241,244,69,14,217,15,4,139,35,3,48,168,91,23,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
