Masquerading as a movie in progress, it is a way of highlighting the struggle of trying to keep the band together against a pretty hostile, or worse, apathetic audience. \n\nThe frustration of putting something out that is artistically brilliant has a particular significance, as music and film go hand in hand. The film dialogue is either hilarious or it will leave you cold. The former is the general consensus. Zappa was so far ahead that his earth life ended before we caught up with him. Weird but highly recommended.  \n\n \nRecorded from October 1967 to February 1968. Includes liner notes by Frank Zappa.\n\nUNCLE MEAT was digitally remixed with approximately 40 minutes of previously unreleased material from the original sessions.
