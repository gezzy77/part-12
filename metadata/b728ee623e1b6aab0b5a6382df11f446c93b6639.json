Most of the serials were taken from this torrent, &quot;http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6699564/Doctor_Who_1963-1989&quot;. The rest are my own DVD rips with the exception of The Ambassadors of Death and Terror of the Autons. \n\nEpisodes were reenoded with h264 @ 1000 kbps to make the size more manageable, 175 megabyte files versus the originals which were around 350 megabytes. Also some of the episodes were interlaced which i fixed. All the DVD rips have a resolution of 640x480 encoded with h264 @ 1000 kbps. \n\n0701 - Spearhead From Space - DVD rip\n0702 - Doctor Who and The Silurians - DVD rip\n0703 - The Ambassadors of Death - VHS rip\n0704 - Inferno - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0801 - Terror of the Autons - DVD rip not made by me, the resolution is lower than what i would use (512x384) and it's encoded in XVID versus H264. Still it's the best copy i could find. \n0802 - The Mind of Evil - Australian digital TV broadcast, the remastered version of this serial hasn't been released yet so it's still in black and white. \n0803 - The Claws of Axos - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0804 - Colony in Space - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0805 - The Daemons - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0901 - Day of the Daleks - DVD rip\n0902 - The Curse of Peladon - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0903 - The Sea Devils - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0904 - The Mutants - Australian digital TV broadcast\n0905 - The Time Monster - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1001 - The Three Doctors - DVD rip\n1002 - Carnival of Monsters - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1003 - Frontier In Space - DVD rip\n1004 - Planet of the Daleks - DVD rip\n1005 - The Green Death - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1101 - The Time Warrior - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1102 - Invasion of the Dinosaurs - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1103 - Death to the Daleks - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1104 - The Monster of Peladon - Australian digital TV broadcast\n1105 - Planet of the Spiders - Australian digital TV broadcast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b728ee623e1b6aab0b5a6382df11f446c93b6639","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+1970+-+1974+%283rd+Doctor+-+Jon+Pertwee%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b728ee623e1b6aab0b5a6382df11f446c93b6639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,40,238,98,62,27,106,171,11,90,99,130,223,17,244,70,201,59,102,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
