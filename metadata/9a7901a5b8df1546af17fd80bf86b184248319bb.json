Nearby, photojournalist Jim de Booy is taking pictures of a TV star; he notices odd things and people. Over the next few days, Jim uncovers a conspiracy behind the murder, a plot involving Dutch state security, defense contractors, and shadowy Americans. A key to understanding the plot may be a Turkish woman, Ayse Him, an animal- rights activist recently released from prison. Jim searches for her. State security soon knows of his investigation, and that puts him and his 16-year old daughter Marije in danger. How many will die to keep Fortuyn's real killers secret?\nWritten by jhailey.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7901a5b8df1546af17fd80bf86b184248319bb","amp;dn":"06-05+%5BMay+6th%5D+%282004%29+Theo+van+Gogh+NL+st+EN+Xvid-mp3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7901a5b8df1546af17fd80bf86b184248319bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,121,1,165,184,223,21,70,175,23,253,128,191,134,177,132,36,131,25,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
