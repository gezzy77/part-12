Whitaker, &quot;AC Power Systems Handbook, Third Edition (Electrical Engineering Handbook)&quot;\nCRC | 2006-09-26 | ISBN: 0849340349 | 428 pages | PDF \n\n\t\n&gt; Presents comprehensive coverage for planning, design, and maintaining commercial and industrial power systems\n\n&gt; Outlines various protection options, their relative benefits, and how to determine the appropriate level of protection\n\n&gt; Devotes three chapter to grounding, supplying step-by-step guidelines for designing safe systems with good performance\n\n&gt; Covers all aspects of safety in detail, treating the subject with deserving care and severity\n\n&gt; Features a larger format for clearer presentation while fitting more material into the same number of pages\n\n\nSooner or later, power system protection is going to cost money. How much is entirely up to you. Setting up a safe and effective AC power system from the very beginning can help avoid costly downtime and repairs, provide backup power during system outages, and minimize workplace accidents. For the past 15 years, Jerry Whitaker's AC Power Systems Handbook has supplied industry professionals with a comprehensive, practical guide to the key elements of AC power for commercial and industrial systems.\n\nThis third edition is thoroughly revised and completely reorganized to reflect the changing demands of modern power systems. To ease navigation, many sections are now presented as separate chapters filled with updated and expanded information. Most notably, the author adds heavily in the areas of transient suppression hardware, electrical system components, and power system fundamentals. Following a logical progression, coverage flows from power system operation to protecting equipment loads, selecting the right level of protection, grounding, standby power, and safety. Along the way, the author paints a clear picture of the sources of disturbances, the tradeoffs involved for different options, and the advantages and limitations of various approaches.\n\nStreamlined to be a hands-on, user-oriented guide, the AC Power Systems Handbook offers expert guidance on designing and installing a safe and efficient power system.\n\nContents:\n\nChapter 1: AC Power Systems\nChapter 2: Power-Generation Systems\nChapter 3: Power Factor\nChapter 4: Power Transformers\nChapter 5: Capacitors\nChapter 6: Semiconductors\nChapter 7: Rectifier and Filter Circuits\nChapter 8: Power Electronics\nChapter 9: Origins of AC Line Disturbances\nChapter 10: Power Disturbance Characterization\nChapter 11: Power System Protection Methods\nChapter 12: Motor-Generator Set\nChapter 13: Uninterruptible Power Systems\nChapter 14: Power Conditioning Devices\nChapter 15: Transient-Suppression Devices\nChapter 16: Facility Wiring and Transient Protection\nChapter 17: Circuit-Level Transient Suppression\nChapter 18: Grounding Practices\nChapter 19: Grounding Tower Elements\nChapter 20: Facility Ground-System Design\nChapter 21: Standby Power Systems\nChapter 22: Designing for Fault-Tolerance\nChapter 23: The Efficient Use of Energy\nChapter 24: Safety and Protection Systems\nChapter 25: Reference Data and Tables\nChapter 26: Units Conversion Table","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f53dc44fe63b61e818d944ac98bb31b5ed52c4","amp;dn":"AC+Power+Systems+Handbook%2C3rd+Edition+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f53dc44fe63b61e818d944ac98bb31b5ed52c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,245,61,196,79,230,59,97,232,24,217,68,172,152,187,49,181,237,82,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
