An immense blow-out of anomalous energy changes the Zone. \n\nThere are no more reliable and relatively safe roads. The entire levels vanish \nin the outbursts of anomalies. Stalkers and even expeditions die or end up \nsealed on the lost territories. New areas, which remained unknown since the \ntime of the Zone emergence, appear on the Zone map. The Zone continues to \nshake with blowouts. The Zone is unstable.The anomalous activity is at its \nmaximum. \n\nChanges of the Zone map known to stalkers shake the fragile balance of \nforces in the Zone. Among the groupings, there flare up hostilities for \nthe new territories, artefact fields and spheres of influence. \n\nThere are no more old enemies or friends - now everyone is for himself. \nThe Factions War has started between the groupings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4159a206414700d22d3391b515bc842c7e5f942","amp;dn":"Stalker+Clear+Sky+rus+%2B+Patch+v1.5.05+rus+%2B+NoDVD+v1.5.05+rus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4159a206414700d22d3391b515bc842c7e5f942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,21,154,32,100,20,112,13,34,211,57,27,81,91,200,66,199,229,249,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
