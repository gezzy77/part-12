The title comes from a Ray Bradbury short story (which is itself taken from a line in the poem &quot;The Song of Wandering Aengus&quot; by William Butler Yeats). It collected 20 songs performed by recent underground folk and psychedelic artists and has since become considered the definitive compilation of what some have dubbed the New Weird America movement. It also featured artwork by Banhart himself.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. Vetiver (with Hope Sandoval) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Angel's Share&quot;\n   2.
