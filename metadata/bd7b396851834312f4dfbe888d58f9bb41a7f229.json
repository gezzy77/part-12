A total of 57 issues were produced, written by Jim Salicrup. During the early years, a comic-book version of one of The Electric Company Spidey skits was included. A truncated version also appeared in The Electric Company Magazine. \n\nEvery issue of Spidey Super Stories featured at least one story where Spidey would team up with an established Marvel Comics superhero to fight an established Marvel villain. This served to introduce other Marvel characters to new readers who were unfamiliar with the company's characters prior to seeing Spider-Man on The Electric Company. Most of these stories would feature quick origins, usually taking up a single page or less, of both the featured hero and villain. Guest heroes included Iron Man (on several occasions), Captain America, Doctor Strange, Shanna the She-Devil, Nova, and Captain Britain; guest villains included the Green Goblin, the Blizzard, Jack O'Lantern, and even Thanos.\n\nThis is fun stuff guys. Grab it all and seed it well.\n\nAll thanks to original scanners and uploaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7b396851834312f4dfbe888d58f9bb41a7f229","amp;dn":"Spidey+Super+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7b396851834312f4dfbe888d58f9bb41a7f229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,123,57,104,81,131,67,18,244,223,190,136,141,88,249,187,65,167,242,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
