Donaldson.\n\nThis series of ten high fantasy novels was written from 1977 through 2014, and is rather unconventional for the genre (protagonist is a leper for example).\nAll files are .mp3 format.\n\n\n-First Chronicles-\n\nLord Foul's Bane (read by John Chancer)\n\nThe Illearth War (read by John Chancer)\n\nThe Power That Preserves (read by John Chancer)\n\n\n-Second Chronicles-\n\nThe Wounded Land (read by John Chancer)\n\nThe One Tree (read by John Chancer)\n\nWhite Gold Wielder (read by John Chancer)\n\n\n-Last Chronicles-\n\nRunes of the Earth (read by Scott Brick)\n\nFatal Revenant (read by Scott Brick)\n\nAgainst All Things Ending (read by Tim Gerard Reynolds)\n\nThe Last Dark (read by Scott Brick)\n\n\nNote - I did not encode these myself, just compiled the best audio from each torrent available and cleaned up the file structure.
