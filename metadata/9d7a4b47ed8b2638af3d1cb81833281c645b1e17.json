Transcribed with a $2500 MC cartridge into a $15,000 custom built tube phono stage. Includes some better known material (Dire Straits, Brubeck, Paul Simon, David Crosby) as well as some relatively obscure material (Tish Hinojosa, Starbuck, Shakatak). Included are some 12-inch, 45 rpm tranfers that sound fantastic. Each individual track contains metadata-album cover etc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7a4b47ed8b2638af3d1cb81833281c645b1e17","amp;dn":"Audiophile+vinyl+rips%2C+tube+electronics%2C+MC+cartridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7a4b47ed8b2638af3d1cb81833281c645b1e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,122,75,71,237,139,38,56,175,61,28,184,24,51,40,28,100,91,30,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
