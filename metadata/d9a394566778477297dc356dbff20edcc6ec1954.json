The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992).\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S.[1] Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,[2] The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.[3][4] Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status.[5] The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States.[5] The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date.[6] The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called Ã‚Â¡Uno!, Ã‚Â¡Dos!, and Ã‚Â¡TrÃƒÂ©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a394566778477297dc356dbff20edcc6ec1954","amp;dn":"Green+Day+-+Studio+Discography+1990+-+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a394566778477297dc356dbff20edcc6ec1954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,163,148,86,103,120,71,114,151,220,53,109,191,242,14,220,198,236,25,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
