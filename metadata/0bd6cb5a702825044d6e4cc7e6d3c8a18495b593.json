Although she knows virtually nothing about Mark's past, Celia decides to marry him. She soon realises that something is wrong. Mark has a son by a previous, doomed marriage, and also has a morbid fascination for murder. What intrigues Celia most is a locked door in her husband's mansion, a door to a room she must never seeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nAn example of Hollywood's mooncalf affair with Freud during the '40s, ending in an absurd instant cure for psychopathy. But the premise is fascinating, and fraught with Gothic overtones as Bennett's heroine ('This is not the time to think of danger', she murmurs at the outset, shaking off premonition, 'this is my wedding day') gradually realises that, married to an architect (Redgrave) who literally and obsessively 'collects' rooms in which murders have occurred, she must uncover the secret of the one room always kept locked. \n\nLang himself didn't think much of the film, but nevertheless set it under his usual sign of destiny ('This is not the time to think of danger...') and invested it with roots in older myths of the magic power of love. His direction is masterly, imposing meanings and tensions through images that are spare, resonant and astonishingly beautiful. A remarkable film.\n\nSublime, delirious melodrama, it stars Joan Bennett as a sleepwalking heiress who meets a charming architect (Michael Redgrave) in Mexico, and marries in haste. He turns out to have a bizarre family past and a weird present that includes re-creating in the basement of his New England mansion the rooms where famous murders occurred. Redgrave was cast because of his schizophrenic ventriloquist in Dead of Night. The outstanding photography is by Stanley Cortez, who shot The Magnificent Ambersons and The Night of the Hunter. The noir score is the work of MiklÃƒÂ³s RÃƒÂ³zsa, who won Oscars for Spellbound and Ben-Hur. The surreal credit titles were executed at the Disney Studio.\n\nVIDEO\n\nSize.... 2.19gb\n\nDuration.... 01:39:05\nCodec....... avc1\nFrame Width.... 960\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 3001kbps\n\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\n\nAUDIO\n\nBit Rate.... 164kbps\n1 Channel mono\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\n\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd6cb5a702825044d6e4cc7e6d3c8a18495b593","amp;dn":"Secret+Beyond+the+Door+1947+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd6cb5a702825044d6e4cc7e6d3c8a18495b593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,214,203,90,112,40,37,4,77,110,76,199,230,211,200,161,132,149,181,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
