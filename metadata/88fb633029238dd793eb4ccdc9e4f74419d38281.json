If so, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more important than ever to be aware of what your body is saying to the outside world. Unfortunately, most of what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard from other body language experts is wrong, and, as a result, your actions may be hurting, not helping, you.\n\nWith sass and a keen eye, media favorite Janine Driver teaches you the skills she used every day to stay alive during her fifteen years as a body-language expert at the ATF. JanineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 7-day plan and her 7-second solutions teach you dozens of body language fixes to turn any interpersonal situation to your advantage. She reveals methods here that other experts refuse to share with the public, and she debunks major myths other experts swear are fact:\n\nGiving more eye contact is key when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to impress someone. Not necessarily true. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually more important where you point your belly button. This small body shift communicates true interest more powerfully than constant eye contact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fb633029238dd793eb4ccdc9e4f74419d38281","amp;dn":"You+Say+More+Than+You+Think%3A+A+7-Day+Plan+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fb633029238dd793eb4ccdc9e4f74419d38281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,251,99,48,41,35,141,215,147,235,76,205,201,228,247,68,25,211,130,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
