Then came the Carpet . . . ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the old story everyone knows and loves. But now the Carpet is home to many different tribes and peoples, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a new story in the making. The story of Fray, sweeping a trail of destruction across the Carpet. The story of power-hungry moulsÃ¢â‚¬â€and of two brothers who set out on an adventure to end all adventures when their village is flattened.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story that will come to a terrible endÃ¢â‚¬â€if someone doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something about it. If everyone doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something about it . . .\n\nFirst published in 1971, this hilarious and wise novel marked the debut of the phenomenal Sir Terry Pratchett.
