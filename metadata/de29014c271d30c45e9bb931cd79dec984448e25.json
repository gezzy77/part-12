Now he tells the story of   \n the world in 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers - in just four\n minutes.                                                                      \n                                                                               \n The film also explores cutting-edge examples of statistics in action today. In\n San Francisco, a new app mashes up police department data with the city's     \n street map to show what crime is being reported street by street, house by    \n house, in near real-time. Every citizen can use it and the hidden patterns of \n their city are starkly revealed. Meanwhile, at Google HQ the machine          \n translation project tries to translate between 57 languages, using lots of    \n statistics and no linguists.                                                  \n                                                                               \n Despite its light and witty touch, the film nonetheless has a serious message \n - without statistics we are cast adrift on an ocean of confusion, but armed   \n with stats we can take control of our lives, hold our rulers to account and   \n see the world as it really is. What's more, Hans concludes, we can now collect\n and analyse such huge quantities of data and at such speeds that scientific   \n method itself seems to be changing.                                           \n\n                                Enjoy!\n ###############################################################################\n We are currently looking for:\n * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (FiOS and Fibe 25 cappers)\n * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n E-mail enquires to C4TV at hush dot com.\n ###############################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de29014c271d30c45e9bb931cd79dec984448e25","amp;dn":"The.Joy.of.Stats.2010.DOCU.WebRip.XviD-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de29014c271d30c45e9bb931cd79dec984448e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,41,1,76,39,29,48,196,94,155,185,49,205,121,222,201,132,68,142,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
