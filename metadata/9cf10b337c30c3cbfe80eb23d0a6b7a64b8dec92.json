Love Junk features the minor hits &quot;She's So Young&quot; and &quot;Hard to Laugh,&quot; as well as the band's signature hit, &quot;I'm an Adult Now.&quot; While the song put TPOH on the map in Canada, it was initially banned by MTV due to its &quot;naughty&quot; (for 1986) lyrics about girls (&quot;I can't even look at young girls anymore/People will think I'm some kind of pervert&quot;) and drugs (&quot;I'd sure look like a fool dead in a ditch somewhere with my mind full of chemicals like some cheese-eating high school boy&quot;). Picked up by college radio, &quot;I'm an Adult Now&quot; also helped spawn the more mainstream hit &quot;She's So Young.&quot; On Love Junk, singer/songwriter Moe Berg mixes frustration, rejection, and anguish with hefty doses of humor -- the trademark TPOH sound -- and the album remains one of the band's finest efforts.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf10b337c30c3cbfe80eb23d0a6b7a64b8dec92","amp;dn":"The+Pursuit+Of+Happiness+-+Love+Junk+%5B1988%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf10b337c30c3cbfe80eb23d0a6b7a64b8dec92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,241,11,51,124,48,195,203,254,128,235,35,208,166,183,166,75,141,236,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
