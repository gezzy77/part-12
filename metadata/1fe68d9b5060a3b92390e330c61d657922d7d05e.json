The concert turned out to be a summit gathering of some of the greatest names in Blues music, when guitarists Albert King and Buddy Guy, harmonica player Junior Wells and singers Etta James and Sippie Wallace, all showed up to sit in with the band. \n\nThat night musical history was written when MayallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bluesbreakers, featuring former Bluesbreaker and one-time Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor, bassist John McVie (Bluesbreakers, Fleetwood Mac), and drummer Colin Allen (Bob Dylan, Solomon Burke), paid homage to, and played with these five immortals of the genre. The result was a Blues lover's dream come true, with Albert, Buddy and Mick swapping blistering solos, Etta and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the then 83-year-old Sippie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wailing as only they can, and Junior adding his trademark harp attack.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nCD1\n01.
