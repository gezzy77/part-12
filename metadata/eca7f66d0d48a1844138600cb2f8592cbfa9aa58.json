Most of the truly wealthy in this country donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t live in Beverly Hills or on Park Avenue-they\n live next door. This new edition, the first since 1998, includes a new foreword for the twenty-first century by Dr. Thomas J. Stanley.\n\nHow can you join the ranks of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wealthy (defined as people whose net worth is over one million dollars)? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy, say\n doctors Stanley and Danko, who have spent the last 20 years interviewing members of this elite club: you just have to follow seven\n simple rules. The first rule is, always live well below your means. The last rule is, choose your occupation wisely. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to\n buy the book to find out the other five. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only fair. The authorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ conclusions are commonsensical. But, as they point out, their\n prescription often flies in the face of what we think wealthy people should do. There are no pop stars or athletes in this book, \nbut plenty of wall-board manufacturersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“particularly ones who take cheap, infrequent vacations! Stanley and Danko mercilessly show\n how wealth takes sacrifice, discipline, and hard work, qualities that are positively discouraged by our high-consumption society.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t what you drive,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ admonish the authors.
