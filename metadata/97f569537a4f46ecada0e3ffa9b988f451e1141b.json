(The last 3)\n\nBreak the Spell is a gleaming showcase for frontman Chris Daughtry's powerful,\nemotionally resonant voice and knack for relentless melodic hooks and big, anthemic\nchoruses. Produced by Howard Benson, who produced Daughtry's two previous albums,\nBreak The Spell gives the band room to evolve musically while aiming to satisfy its\nmany long-time fans. &quot;Going in to the writing sessions, we said, 'Let's not try to\nsound like anything. Let's just write, and see what happens,'&quot; says Chris, who\nco-wrote every song with either one of his band-mates (guitarists Josh Steely and\nBrian Craddock and bassist Josh Paul) or collaborators such as Marti Frederiksen,\nBusbee, and Bret James. &quot;We came up with some pretty interesting tunes that sound\nnothing like anything we've done before. Even though some of them didn't make the\nalbum, the process stretched us and took us to new places. It was an absolutely\ninspirational experience.&quot;\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Renegade                                             [03:36]\n02.Crawling back to you                                 [03:45]\n03.Outta my head                                        [03:31]\n04.Start of something good                              [04:25]\n05.Crazy                                                [03:25]\n06.Break the spell                                      [03:32]\n07.We're not gonna fall                                 [03:19]\n08.Gone too soon                                        [03:36]\n09.Losing my mind                                       [03:49]\n10.Rescue me                                            [03:23]\n11.Louder than ever                                     [03:37]\n12.Spaceship                                            [03:51]\n13.Who's they                                           [03:12]\n14.Maybe we're already gone                             [04:22]\n15.Everything but me                                    [04:29]\n16.Lullaby                                              [02:26]\n________\n58:18 min\n 98,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
