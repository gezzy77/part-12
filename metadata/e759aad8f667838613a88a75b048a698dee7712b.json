Not to be confused with the weak OST available which only contains the filler tracks used to bridge scenes.\n\nI scanned every episode for anything that could be considered musical; trimmed the fat; leveled the audio; labelled appropriately; and boom! There you have it: tasty treats.\n\nI kept the songs in chronological order as a lot of them are linked. Also to anyone interested in learning the episodes from which the tracks were taken, this information can be found in the comments section of each track.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIt's Always Sunny In Philadelphia - Greatest Hits\n01 Temptation Sensation (Heinz Kiessling)\n02 More Than Words\n03 Dennis And Dee Go On Welfare\n04 Save The Children (feat.
