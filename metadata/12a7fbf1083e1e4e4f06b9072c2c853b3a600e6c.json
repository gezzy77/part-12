Believing the war all but over, U.S. military leaders refused to commit the extra infantry, artillery, and attack helicopters required to fight the war's biggest battleÃ¢â‚¬â€ a missed opportunity to crush hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and some of its most senior leaders.\n\nEyewitness Naylor vividly portrays the heroism of the young, untested soldiers, the fanaticism of their ferocious enemy, the mistakes that led to a hellish mountaintop firefight, and how thirteen American commandos embodied &quot;Patton's three principles of war&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€audacity, audacity, and audacityÃ¢â‚¬â€by creeping unseen over frozen mountains into the heart of an enemy stronghold to prevent a U.S. military catastrophe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12a7fbf1083e1e4e4f06b9072c2c853b3a600e6c","amp;dn":"Not+a+Good+Day+to+Die+by+Sean+Naylor+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12a7fbf1083e1e4e4f06b9072c2c853b3a600e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,167,251,241,8,62,30,78,79,6,185,7,44,44,133,59,58,96,14,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
