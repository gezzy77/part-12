Some of the lyrics may parody the lyrical and social conventions of the '50s, but Zappa loved this music and it shows. According to Frank (&quot;Serious Fan Mail&quot;), promo copies were sent out to oldies radio stations at the time (with no mention of the Mothers) and they were very well received...until word got out. Some of these songs may be funny, but &quot;Anything&quot; is as beautiful as any song in the genre (Ray Collins' lead vocal is pure gold). Since the tunes are fairly simple, it's Frank's arranging skills that are really on display. Four tunes from Freak Out! are totally rearranged for Ruben, and all the doo wop vocal parts are wonderful. But there are also some cool things going on below the surface, too, like some of the rhythmic accents from the drums or the backing vocals on &quot;Fountain of Love&quot; singing the opening melody from Stravinsky's &quot;Rite of Spring.&quot;\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tZappa Records\nCatalog:\t\tZR 20010 \n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Cheap Thrills\n02.Love Of My Life\n03.How Could I Be Such A Fool\n04.Deseri\n05.I'm Not Satisfied\nRoll Gum Drop\n07.Anything\n08.Later That Night\n09.You Didn't Try To Call Me\n10.Fountain Of Love\n11.No. No. No.\n12.Anyway The Wind Blows\n13.Stuff Up The Cracks\nRoll Gum Drop (Alternate Mono Mix)\n15.No. No. No. (Long Version)\n16.Stuff Up The Cracks (Alternate Mix)\n17.Serious Fan Mail (Dialogue)\nRoll Gum Drop (Single Version)\n18.Valerie (Mono Version)\n20.Secret Greasing (Dialogue)\n21.Love Of My Life (Cucamonga Version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e48ad4e92142c9ecdf573100c0c3058b36730d","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Greasy+Love+Songs+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e48ad4e92142c9ecdf573100c0c3058b36730d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,228,138,212,233,33,66,201,236,223,87,49,0,192,195,5,139,54,115,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
