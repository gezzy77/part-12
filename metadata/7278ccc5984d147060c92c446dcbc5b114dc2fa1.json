This is the band's first\nalbum with their classic line-up adding new\nbassist Christian Olde Wolbers. Many regard it\nas the band's best album and a heavy metal\nclassic.\n\nThe opening sample for &quot;Pisschrist&quot; and &quot;Zero Signal&quot;\nare both taken from &quot;Terminator 2:Judgment Day&quot;.\n\nThe album was recorded at Bearsville Studios in\nrural New York. Also in residence at the studio\nwas Bon Jovi, recording their album These Days.\nFear Factory were in the studio next door and\none of Bon Jovi's engineers asked them to turn\nthe sound down, as it was bleeding into Bon Jovi's\nrecording sessions.
