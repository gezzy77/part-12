They hunt insurgents each night on a harrowing patrol, guided by three simple goals: protect civilians, kill the enemy, and stay aliveÃ¢â‚¬â€because in a for-profit war manufactured by the defense industry there can be no cause worth dying for. To keep his soldiers safe, Shelley uses every high-tech asset available to himÃ¢â‚¬â€but his best weapon is a flawless sense of imminent danger...as if God is with him, whispering warnings in his ear.
