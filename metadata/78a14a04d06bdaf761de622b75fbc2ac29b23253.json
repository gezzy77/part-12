The good news is that when you |\r\n| understand what's really been secretly holding you back, you'll finally |\r\n| have the map for how to escape. You're about to discover: |\r\n| |\r\n| * The secret to getting answers when you're feeling lost, confused, and |\r\n| have no idea what to do or where to even begin |\r\n| |\r\n| * How to tap into your inner strength to experience more motivation, |\r\n| happiness, and fulfillment on demand - regardless of what's happening in |\r\n| your life |\r\n| |\r\n| * How to get whatever you want, even if you're stressed out, busy, or have |\r\n| a million excuses |\r\n| |\r\n| * What the six things are that drive all of your behavior and how to tap |\r\n| into them to reprogram any thought or habit on a neurological level |\r\n| |\r\n| * What the most common fear is that holds people back, and why you'll never|\r\n| overcome it until you understand this one simple thing |\r\n| |\r\n| * Why a force stronger than willpower may be the missing link to getting |\r\n| yourself out of any rut. |\r\n| |\r\n| * Why much of the great advice you've heard, especially from self-help and |\r\n| personal development gurus, may be the very thing that's keeping you |\r\n| stuck. |\r\n| |\r\n| * Why looking to find your life's purpose is almost always going to |\r\n| backfire on you. |\r\n| |\r\n| Is This Just Another One Of Those Courses That Says Success Is Easy? |\r\n| |\r\n| While many things in life are simple in concept, they're not always easy to|\r\n| do. |\r\n| |\r\n| I feel it can be doing a disservice to some to have marketing that says |\r\n| everything is super easy. Then when a person &quot;fails,&quot; they beat themselves|\r\n| up because they couldn't even do the &quot;easy&quot; things. This leads to further |\r\n| hopelessness, or at least instills an attitude that hard work isn't |\r\n| required. |\r\n| |\r\n| However, I do believe many things in this course are practical and |\r\n| relatively &quot;easy&quot; with practice. This is why I say if you practice what's |\r\n| in here, it may become &quot;easier done than said&quot; instead of &quot;easier said |\r\n| than done.&quot; |\r\n| |\r\n| You must understand this however... |\r\n| |\r\n| If you're willing to do what's hard, it will be easy. If you're only |\r\n| willing to do what's easy, it will be hard. |\r\n| |\r\n| Once you become comfortable with discomfort, your ability to stretch your |\r\n| current capacity becomes greatly expanded. |\r\n| |\r\n| Yes, I'm well away I market this as being simple, and even say many things |\r\n| are &quot;doable&quot; and don't automatically elicit an &quot;easier said than done&quot; |\r\n| response. |\r\n| |\r\n| Is There Any Guarantee This Will Work For Me? |\r\n| |\r\n| It's both true and false there is no &quot;one size fits all formula.&quot; While I |\r\n| can't offer strategies that work for everyone, I can share universal |\r\n| principles that you can apply to get results. |\r\n| |\r\n| Those results may not show up instantly, but they will show up with |\r\n| perseverance. Like a rocket needing constant propulsion before it reaches |\r\n| outer space. |\r\n| |\r\n| Beyond that, a primary goal of this course is to unlock your OWN inner |\r\n| creativity and problem solving abilities. This won't be me telling you a |\r\n| bunch of things to do and not do, but you finding for yourself your own |\r\n| answers. |\r\n| |\r\n| No matter what, there's a money back guarantee that I stand behind. So the |\r\n| worst thing that happens is you get some interesting psychological |\r\n| insights and food for thought and get your money back, and the best thing |\r\n| is your life is radically transformed for the better. |\r\n| |\r\n| You Have A Choice To Make... |\r\n| |\r\n| There are many courses out there that can give you the education you need, |\r\n| and many mentors I've learned from. I believe this is one of the best |\r\n| distillations of all that knowledge. I believe those who come on board |\r\n| will be very happy with their choice, and for those who don't, I honor |\r\n| that and hope you find the insights you need from somewhere else. |\r\n| |\r\n| However, you must remember this choice you have... |\r\n| |\r\n| You can either choose to educate yourself and learn the principles of |\r\n| success through the wisdom of others and your own application of |\r\n| principles... |\r\n| |\r\n| Or you can choose ignorance and simply hope that life hands you success |\r\n| without you having to figure out how to achieve it. Perhaps having to |\r\n| learn from mistake after mistake until you put the pieces together after |\r\n| losing so much. I warn you, this path has not worked for many. |\r\n| |\r\n| Now is your time to decide, education or ignorance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a14a04d06bdaf761de622b75fbc2ac29b23253","amp;dn":"UDEMY+SUCCESS+MADE+SIMPLE+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a14a04d06bdaf761de622b75fbc2ac29b23253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,161,74,4,208,107,218,247,97,222,98,43,117,251,194,172,41,178,50,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
