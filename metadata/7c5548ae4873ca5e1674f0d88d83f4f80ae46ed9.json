Not 'quite' the infamous 1969 Beatles rooftop performance, but the closest our generation will get. But great concert!!\n\nAfter several days of video editing, I cut this to play as one contiguous 30 minute concert. In reality in this July 15, 2009 appearance, Sir Douglas and the Band played Get Back and Sing the Changes on the David Letterman Show atop the Theatre marquee, while the other 5 songs were only broadcast by CBS on streaming webcast. After much work I recorded and converted the streaming webcast and edited it into The Late Show songs. Something about them playing outdoors on Broadway in New York City in the middle of the day gives this concert a great joie de vivre and his band is excellent.\n\nThe sound and video are better on the 2 songs showed on CBS, but the sound is surprisingly decent on the webcast as well and I edited it several times to make it as seamless as possible with the 2 nationally broadcast songs. The video quality on the stream-cast is obviously reduced, but it's virtually seamless (no jerkiness typical of stream-casts) and better than I've seen uploaded elsewhere on other torrent sites.\n\n\n\nFull concert in order:\n\n1. Get Back\n2. Sing The Changes (excellent new song and album from Paul's Electric Arguments by The Fireman)\n3. Coming Up \n4. Band on the Run \n5. Let Me Roll It \n6. Helter Skelter\n7. Back in the USSR\n8. 30 sec 'Easter Egg'\n\nTechnical info:\nVid length:31:27 \nCodec: DivX 6.8 avi file\nSize: 540 X 300 pxls\nVideo rate - 1200 KBps\nAudio rate - 192 KBps (probably overkill since I'm sure they streamed less than that)\n\n\nEnjoy!- this is about the 12th rip/edit of this to work out several kinks. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5548ae4873ca5e1674f0d88d83f4f80ae46ed9","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+full+30+minute+David+Letterman+rooftop+concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5548ae4873ca5e1674f0d88d83f4f80ae46ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,85,72,174,72,115,202,94,22,116,240,216,141,131,244,248,10,228,110,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
