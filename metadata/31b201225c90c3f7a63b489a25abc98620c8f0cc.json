It is a reality today. The country has gone from the world's largest creditor to its greatest debtor; the value of the dollar is sinking; domestic manufacturing is winding down - and these trends don't seem to be slowing. Peter Schiff casts a sharp, clear-sighted eye on these factors and explains what the possible effects may be and how investors can protect themselves. For more than a decade, Schiff has not only observed the U.S. economy, but also helped his clients reposition their portfolios to reflect his outlook. What he sees is a nation facing an economic storm brought on by growing federal, personal, and corporate debt, too-little savings, a declining dollar, and lack of domestic manufacturing. \nCrash-Proof is an informed and informative warning of a looming period marked by sizeable tax hikes, loss of retirement benefits, double digit inflation, even - as happened recently in Argentina - the possible collapse of the middle class. However, Schiff does have a survival plan that can provide the protection that readers will need in the coming years. \n\nFrom the Inside Flap\nFrom both an economic and monetary perspective, the United States is a house of cardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½impressive on the outside, but a disaster waiting to happen beneath the surface. In a relatively short period of time, the country has gone from the world's largest creditor to its greatest debtor; the value of the dollar has declined; and domestic manufacturing has given way to non-exportable services. While these and other issues could potentially spell disaster for your financial well-being, the situation could also present unique opportunitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if you're prepared.\nFor more than a decade, seasoned Wall Street prognosticator Peter Schiff has not only observed the U.S. economy, but also helped his clients restructure their portfolios to reflect his outlook. What he sees today is a nation facing an economic storm brought on by growing federal, personal, and corporate debt; too little savings; a declining dollar; and lack of domestic manufacturing.\n\nNow, in Crash Proof, Schiff provides you with an insightful examination of the structural weaknesses underlying this impending economic meltdown, and discusses the measures you can take to protect yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as profitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½during the difficult times that lie ahead. Using common-sense analysis, creative analogies, and easy-to-understand language, Schiff entertains as well as educates. While Schiff carefully details the grave economic forces pushing the United States closer to the edge, he also outlines a specific three-step plan that will allow you to preserve wealth and protect the purchasing power of the savings you have worked a lifetime to accumulate.\n\nStep #1: Rethinking Your Stock Portfolio: shows you exactly how to replace your endangered U.S. dollar holdings with a portfolio of foreign securities that are safer, significantly higher yielding, and appropriate for any investment objectives\n\nStep #2: Gold Rush: examines the various ways you can capitalize on the bull market in gold, as well as silver, and explains how these precious metals can add both safety and exciting growth potential to a conservative foreign stock portfolio\n\nStep #3: Stay Liquid: discusses the importance of liquidity in times of financial uncertaintyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from having enough money for living expenses to keeping a reserve of uncommitted cash that can be used to acquire assets at bargain prices\n\nInvesting using conventional wisdom will not work during times of financial distress. That's why Crash Proof has taken the reality of today's economic situation into account as it offers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b201225c90c3f7a63b489a25abc98620c8f0cc","amp;dn":"Peter+Schiff+-+Crash+Proof+-+iTunes+AudioBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b201225c90c3f7a63b489a25abc98620c8f0cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,178,1,34,92,144,195,247,166,59,72,154,37,171,201,134,32,200,240,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
