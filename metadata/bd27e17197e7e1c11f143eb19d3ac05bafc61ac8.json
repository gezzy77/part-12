The selected problems do not require advanced mathematics, making this book accessible to a variety of readers. Mathematical recreations offer a rich playground for both amateur and professional mathematicians. Believing that creative stimuli and aesthetic considerations are closely related, great mathematicians from ancient times to the present have always taken an interest in puzzles and diversions. The goal of this book is to show that famous mathematicians have all communicated brilliant ideas, methodological approaches, and absolute genius in mathematical thoughts by using recreational mathematics as a framework. Concise biographies of many mathematicians mentioned in the text are also included. The majority of the mathematical problems presented in this book originated in number theory, graph theory, optimization, and probability. Others are based on combinatorial and chess problems, while still others are geometrical and arithmetical puzzles. This book is intended to be both entertaining as well as an introduction to various intriguing mathematical topics and ideas. Certainly, many stories and famous puzzles can be very useful to prepare classroom lectures, to inspire and amuse students, and to instill affection for mathematics.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 325 pages\n# Publisher: American Mathematical Society (September 2, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0821848143\n# ISBN-13: 978-0821848142","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd27e17197e7e1c11f143eb19d3ac05bafc61ac8","amp;dn":"Famous+Puzzels+of+Great+Mathematicians%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd27e17197e7e1c11f143eb19d3ac05bafc61ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,39,225,113,151,231,225,193,31,20,62,177,157,58,192,91,175,198,26,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
