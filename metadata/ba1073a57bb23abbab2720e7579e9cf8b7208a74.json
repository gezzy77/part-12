She is a singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress. She currently lives in Toronto.\n\nFurtado came to fame in 2000 with the release of her debut album Whoa, Nelly!, which featured her breakthrough Grammy Award-winning single &quot;I'm like a Bird&quot;.\n\nAfter becoming a mother and releasing the less commercially successful Folklore (2003), she returned to prominence in 2006 with the release of Loose and its hit singles &quot;Promiscuous&quot;, &quot;Maneater&quot;, &quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot;, and &quot;Say It Right&quot;.\n\nFurtado is known for experimenting with different instruments, sounds, genres, vocal styles and languages. This diversity has been influenced by her wide-ranging musical taste and her interest in different cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoa, Nelly! \n\n\nWhoa, Nelly! is the debut album by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado, released by DreamWorks Records in North America on October 24, 2000 (see 2000 in music).\n\nIt peaked at number twenty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and opened to critical acclaim. It produced three international singles: &quot;I'm Like a Bird&quot;, &quot;Turn off the Light&quot; and &quot;...On the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot;. &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; was a club-only single released exclusively in the U.S. before the album's availability in stores,[1] and it was included on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Brokedown Palace. When &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; was released, Nelly's label was unsure about the genre in which to market her. They eventually remixed &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; and included it upon this album as &quot;Party&quot;. The DreamWorks label released &quot;Trynna Finda Way&quot; as the fourth single in Mexico and South America, a radio remix of &quot;Hey, Man!&quot; in the UK and Germany, and &quot;Legend&quot; in South Africa. The album spent seventy-eight weeks on the Billboard 200. It hit double-platinum status in the U.S. in January of 2002.[2]\n\nAfter the release of the album, Furtado headlined the Burn in the Spotlight tour and appeared on Moby's Area:One tour. According to Maclean's magazine, Whoa, Nelly! had sold seven million copies worldwide as of August 2006.[3]\n\nWhoa, Nelly! was well received by critics for its eccentric, yet intriguing instrumentations as well as Furtado's vocals. It currently holds a score of 79 from MetaCritic.[4]Slant magazine called it &quot;a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium.&quot;[5] The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and &quot;the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful.&quot;[6] Stephan Thomas of Allmusic gave a positive review while commenting that &quot;Furtado is a restless vocalist, skitting and scatting with abandon, spitting out rapid repetitions, bending notes, and frequently indulging in melismas.&quot;[7] and also stating that &quot;Whoa, Nelly! unfolds as a rewarding, promising debut.&quot;[7] Rolling Stones gave Whoa, Nelly! a positive review calling it a &quot;wild-ass pop go-go, filled with songs that pursue adventure yet could still make the hit parades.&quot;[8]\n\nAs a result of critical acclaim, this album received 4 nominations at the 2002 Grammy ceremony. The album itself received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, while Furtado herself was nominated for Best New Artist, as well as, Song of the Year and Best Pop Female Vocal Performance for &quot;I'm Like a Bird&quot;, in which she received the latter.[9]\n\n\n\n Tracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Hey, Man!&quot; (Nelly Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10 \n2.\t&quot;Shit on the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 \n3.\t&quot;Baby Girl&quot; (Gerald Eaton, Furtado, Brian West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 \n4.\t&quot;Legend&quot; (Eaton, Furtado, West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n5.\t&quot;I'm Like a Bird&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n6.\t&quot;Turn off the Light&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36 \n7.\t&quot;Trynna Finda Way&quot; (Eaton, Furtado, West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n8.\t&quot;Party&quot; (Eaton, Furtado, West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n9.\t&quot;Well, Well&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00 \n10.\t&quot;My Love Grows Deeper Part 1&quot; (Eaton, Furtado, West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23 \n11.\t&quot;I Will Make U Cry&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n12.\t&quot;Scared of You&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:09\n\nAustralia and Canadian Bonus Track \n\n\n13. &quot;Onde EstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\nFolklore \n\n\n\nFolklore is the second album by Canadian pop singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado, released by DreamWorks Records in North America on November 25, 2003 (see 2003 in music)\n\n\nThe album's title was influenced by Furtado's parents' immigration to Canada, &quot;When I look at my old photo albums, I see pictures of their brand-new house, their shiny new car, their first experiences going to very North American-type places like Kmart. When you have that in your blood, you never really part with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it becomes your own personal folklore.&quot;[1] The album also displayed a diverse sound but with a more rock-oriented, acoustic approach.[2]Furtado attributed the mellowness of the album to the fact that she was pregnant during most of its recording.[1]\n\nFolklore includes the single &quot;ForÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a&quot; (meaning &quot;carry on&quot; or &quot;strength&quot; in Portuguese), which was written as the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. Furtado performed the song at the championship's final in Lisbon, in July 2004.[3] Other singles included the ballad &quot;Try&quot; and &quot;Powerless (Say What You Want)&quot;, in which she embraces her Portuguese heritage; the song deals with &quot;the idea that you can still feel like a minority inside, even if you don't look like one on the outside&quot;.[1] Additional singles were released in certain territories; &quot;Explode&quot; in Canada and Europe, and &quot;The Grass Is Green&quot; in Germany.\n\nThe album debuted at number eighteen on the Canadian albums chart with first-week sales of 10,400,[4] and at number thirty-eight on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 68,000 in its first week.[5] According to Nielsen SoundScan, it had sold 425,000 copies in the U.S. by August 2008.[6] It was not as successful as Furtado's debut album, Whoa, Nelly! (2000), partly because of troubles at DreamWorks Records and the less poppy sound.[7] It lacked promotion because DreamWorks was sold to Universal Music Group at the time of Folkore's release, and it spent only eleven weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. In 2005 DreamWorks Records was shut down, and many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records.[8] An enhanced CD, Folklore sold two million copies worldwide[9] and was most successful in Germany. Furtado said, &quot;Why do Germans love this album? I think I figured it out: It's so cerebral. It's great in its own way, but that's a different side.&quot;[10]\n\nFolklore received mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic's Stephan Thomas stated that &quot;[w]hile there are some interesting musical moments on Folklore -- enough to make it worth a listen -- the dogged seriousness and didactic worldview become a bit overbearing not long before the album is a quarter of the way finished, particularly since the fusion of worldbeat and adult alternative pop often seems heavy-handed.&quot;[11] Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review stating that &quot; exultant music goes on its merry, multicultural way&quot;[12]. While Rolling Stone gave a negative review , calling Folklore &quot;slick, multicultural hodgepodge&quot; but without a &quot;good as a single as I'm Like A Bird&quot; [13]As she focused more on the songwriting rather &quot;than on frenetically switching genres five times in one song&quot;,[1] BBC felt that it had &quot;twice the originality&quot; of her debut.[7]\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;One-Trick Pony&quot; featuring the Kronos Quartet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47 \n2.\t&quot;Powerless (Say What You Want)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \no\tSamples Malcolm McLaren's &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; (Anne Dudley, Trevor Horn, McLaren) \n3.\t&quot;Explode&quot; (Eaton, Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \n4.\t&quot;Try&quot; (Furtado, West) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39 \n5.\t&quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16 \n6.\t&quot;ForÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n7.\t&quot;The Grass Is Green&quot; (Mike Elizondo, Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n8.\t&quot;Picture Perfect&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16 \n9.\t&quot;Saturdays&quot; (Furtado) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05 \n10.\t&quot;Build You Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58 \n11.\t&quot;Island of Wonder&quot; (S.

Timbaland and his then-protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Danja produced the bulk of the album, which incorporates influences of dance, R&amp;B and hip hop. The album explores the theme of female sexuality and has been described as introspective or even sad in parts. Its influence comes from some of the themes expressed in the material of artists such as Janet Jackson.\n\nThe album received criticism because of the sexual image Furtado adopted for the recording, with some feeling it was a ploy to sell more records. Further controversy rose over accusations of plagiarism on Timbalands part when recordings were leaked onto Youtube. The record was seen generally as critically and commercially successful. It reached high positions on charts across the world, and according to a November 2007 press release, it had sold more than seven million copies worldwide.[1]\n\nThe album was heavily promoted, released in several editions and was supported by the Get Loose Tour, which is the subject of the concert DVD Loose: The Concert. Eight singles were released from the album, including the U.S. number-one singles &quot;Promiscuous&quot; and &quot;Say It Right&quot;, which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[2][3] Other stand out singles include the UK number-one single &quot;Maneater&quot; and the successful song &quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot;.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCD 1\n\n\n1\t&quot;Afraid&quot;\n(featuring Attitude)\n2\t&quot;Maneater&quot;\n3\t&quot;Promiscuous&quot;\n(featuring Timbaland)\n4\t&quot;Glow&quot;\n5\t&quot;Showtime&quot;\n6\t&quot;No Hay Igual&quot;\n7\t&quot;Te BusquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot;\n(featuring Juanes)\n8\t&quot;Say It Right&quot;\n9\t&quot;Do It&quot;\n10\t&quot;In God's Hands&quot;\n11\t&quot;Wait for You&quot;\n12\t&quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (International Bonus)\n13\t&quot;All Good Things (Come to an End)&quot;\n\n\nCD 2\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Let My Hair Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n2.\t&quot;Undercover&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \n3.\t&quot;Runaway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14 \n4.\t&quot;Te BusquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot; (Spanish version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \n5.\t&quot;No Hay Igual&quot; (remix) (feat.
