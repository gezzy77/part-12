After the group initially broke up in 1982, Henley released his first solo album, I Can't Stand Still. Although it wasn't as successful as an Eagles record, the album performed respectably, launching the number three single &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; and going gold. Building the Perfect Beast followed two years later and established Henley as a solo star in his own right. Featuring the Top Ten hits &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; and &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance,&quot; as well as the Top 40 singles &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot; and &quot;Sunset Grill,&quot; the album sold over two million copies and stayed on the charts for over a year. Henley's third album, 1989's The End of the Innocence, was his most ambitious record yet, as well as his most commercially successful. The album sold over three million copies and stayed on the charts for nearly three years, launching the hit singles &quot;The End of the Innocence,&quot; &quot;Heart of the Matter,&quot; &quot;New York Minute,&quot; &quot;How Bad Do You Want It?,&quot; and &quot;The Last Worthless Evening.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Dirty Laundry\n02.The Boys Of Summer\n03.All She Wants To Do Is Dance\n04.Not Enough Love In The World\n05.Sunset Grill\n06.The End Of The Innocence\n07.The Last Worthless Evening\n08.New York Minute\n09.I Will Not Go Quietly\n10.The Heart Of The Matter\n11.The Garden Of Allah\n12.You Don't Know Me At All\n13.Everybody Knows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                    ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d000c99e665883130ed14293aab6b4f826159d","amp;dn":"Don+Henley+-+Actual+Miles+Henley%5C%27s+Greatest+Hits+%281995%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d000c99e665883130ed14293aab6b4f826159d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,208,0,201,158,102,88,131,19,14,209,66,147,170,182,180,248,38,21,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
