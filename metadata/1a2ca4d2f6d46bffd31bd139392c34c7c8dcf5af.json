Specifically created for designers, it powers a beautiful interface and powerful tools. Tools every designer will appreciate. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one feature Ã¢â‚¬â€ multiple shadows per layer. Making beautiful graphics isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t challenging anymore. We set out to build a better app for graphic designers. Not to copy Ã¢â‚¬â€ rather to improve.\n\nThe vector tools and basic shapes are a fantastic starting point for any drawing, whether you design for web, icons, and more. Sketch has more advanced layer style options than you can dream of: multiple shadows, multiple fills, gradients, noise, blending, blur, and more. To top it off, Sketch has boolean operations to combine multiple shapes into much more complex ones Ã¢â‚¬â€ all of this is non- destructive. Forever.\n\nComing from the developers of Fontcase, text rendering is as good as it can get. Sketch also supports OS XÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built-in versions and auto-saving. To ensure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never lose any files.\n\nAll this power is deliciously baked into SketchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single-window interface. Everything is there, but only visible when you need it. A simple interface with seriously powerful tools.\n\nNow everything is possible.\n\nTake a look at the screenshots to see creations made with Sketch.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Simple but powerful interface, built for OS X Lion and Mountain Lion\n- Optimized for Retina and non-Retina displays\n- Powerful styling; multiple shadows, multiple fills, gradients, blending, blur, noise and more...\n- Flexible boolean operations to combine simple shapes into complex shapes\n- Artboards and Slices for exporting multiple images out of a single document\n- Automatic @2x export for Retina graphics\n- Unique Color (with RGB and HSB modes) and Font pickers\n- Beautiful native text rendering and text styles\n- Vector and pixel zoom; zoom in with infinite vector precision or see individual pixels\n- Multi-stop and radial gradients editing right in the canvas.
