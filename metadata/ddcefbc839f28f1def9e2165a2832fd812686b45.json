The first edition was published in 1965. It is largely a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901, with reference made to various texts in the original languages. It is designed to &quot;amplify&quot; the text by using a system of punctuation and other typographical features to bring out all shades of meaning present in the original texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddcefbc839f28f1def9e2165a2832fd812686b45","amp;dn":"The+Amplified+Bible+AMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddcefbc839f28f1def9e2165a2832fd812686b45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,206,251,200,57,242,143,29,239,158,33,101,162,131,47,216,18,104,107,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
