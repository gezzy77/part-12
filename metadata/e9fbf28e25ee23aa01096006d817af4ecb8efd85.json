Google has responded to the lively interest\nin social networking with one of its own called Google+ (also\nknown as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Google PlusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or even just Ã¢â‚¬Å“g+Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), and Google+ is\nquickly becoming a serious alternative for those looking for a\nnew environment to play in.\nAt an estimated 30 million or so users in just one month,\nGoogle+ is clearly a force to be reckoned with. Google has\nfigured out a way to integrate the network with all of its major\nproducts, which becomes evident the minute you sign up for\nthe service!\nWhy the Ã¢â‚¬Å“plus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you might ask? Rumor has it, Google needed\na place to bring all of its apps into one place, making every\npiece of Google part of a social experience. Now, instead of\njust a bunch of web apps, Google is becoming one large social\nnetwork Ã¢â‚¬â€ Google+ ties everything together right at the heart\nof Google. This spirit of cohesion between all things Google\nwill become even more evident as Google+ grows, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m quite\nsure, and my hope is that this book will make the transition\neasy so that you can enjoy this network as much as I do.\nAbout This Book\nYou donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be new to social media to read this book!\nThe truth is, according to Facebook stats regarding use, you\nmay already log in to Facebook at least once daily, and may\neven have spent more than a couple of years using the service.\nThis book is for new users of Google+ who are coming\nfrom social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Google+\nwonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be exactly what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to, which is why you need\nthis book!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9fbf28e25ee23aa01096006d817af4ecb8efd85","amp;dn":"Google%2B%26trade%3B+For+Dummies%26reg%3B%2C+Portable+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9fbf28e25ee23aa01096006d817af4ecb8efd85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,251,242,142,37,238,35,170,1,9,96,6,216,23,175,78,203,142,253,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
