Drawing on previously unexplored documents, the authors examine how military rivalries influenced the creation of GPS and shaped public perceptions about its origin. Since the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ first program to launch a satellite in the late 1950s, the nation has pursued dual paths into spaceÃ¢â‚¬â€one military and secret, the other scientific and public. Among the many commercial spinoffs this approach has produced, GPS arguably boasts the greatest impact on our daily lives.\nTold by the son of a navy insiderÃ¢â‚¬â€whose work helped lay the foundations for the systemÃ¢â‚¬â€and a science and technology journalist, the story chronicles the research and technological advances required for the development of GPS. The authors peek behind the scenes at pivotal events in GPS history. They note how the technology moved from the laboratory to the battlefield to the dashboard and the smartphone, and they raise the specter of how this technology and its surrounding industry affect public policy. Insights into how the system works and how it fits into a long history of advances in navigation tie into discussions of the myriad applications for GPS.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Technology\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037c9a4c105d40b58d1515d0084b121cb520f125","amp;dn":"GPS+Declassified.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037c9a4c105d40b58d1515d0084b121cb520f125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,124,154,76,16,93,64,181,141,21,21,208,8,75,18,28,181,32,241,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
