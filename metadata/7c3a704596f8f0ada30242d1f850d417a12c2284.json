Wilt\nHardcover: 272 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press (November 15, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0198208715\nISBN-13: 978-0198208716\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: November 15, 2001 | ISBN-10: 0198208715 | ISBN-13: 978-0198208716\nThis groundbreaking study charts Britain's food and agricultural preparations in the 1930s. It shows that in this sector, in contrast to other areas of the economy, government plans were already well-developed by 1939 and examines how the measures of the 1930s not only set the stage for World War II but also contributed to a more robust British agriculture in the decades that followed.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nFood for War sheds light on the complex effort that was required to create a workable wartime food strategy and it acts as a useful reminder that rearmament should be seen in its widest context. Erin Gill, Twentieth Century British History\n\nThis book is the fruit of assiduous research in the UK and the USA, and Alan Wilt has filled a long-standing gap in the literature most comprehensively. It is a notable addition to our understanding of the links between food, farming and rearmament in the 1930s.

Wilt is a Professor Emeritus of History, Iowa State University.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3a704596f8f0ada30242d1f850d417a12c2284","amp;dn":"Alan+F.+Wilt+-+Food+for+War.+Agriculture+and+Rearmament+in+Brita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3a704596f8f0ada30242d1f850d417a12c2284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,58,112,69,150,248,240,173,163,2,66,209,248,80,212,23,161,44,34,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
