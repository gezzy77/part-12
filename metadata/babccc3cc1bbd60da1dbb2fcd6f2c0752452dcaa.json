Lewis himself was possessed of a limited singing range and didn't have what could be considered good looks, yet with a lot of help he managed to make some exceptionally good (and good-selling) records out of Los Angeles, in the midst of the British Invasion, and teenagers loved him. He was the son of actor/comedian/director/producer Jerry Lewis, who was then one of the most popular entertainers in the country. Gary Lewis was born in 1946, before his father's ascent to the top of the entertainment world, but by the time he reached his teens -- and had begun playing drums and leading a combo of his own, which included Dave Walker on rhythm guitar and Dave Costell on lead, Al Ramsey on bass, and John West on the cordovox (a kind of electric accordion) -- Jerry Lewis was a major star and one of the hottest box office and television attractions in the world. He could get a television series on the air, and networks and sponsors opening their checkbooks to back it, just by indicating he wanted to do one, and get a movie made by writing -- or just okaying -- a script. If he had any peer in the business in those days, it was Frank Sinatra. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:diftxqe5ldde~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:diftxqe5ldde~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nGary Lewis &amp; the Playboys have never been taken too seriously by rock historians, which is somewhat a matter of prejudice, growing out of the idea (only partly true) that Lewis had a free ride, thanks to the help of his then superstar entertainer father -- and their status as mid-'60s pop/rock entertainers, without a resident songwriter or a philosophy behind their work. They weren't great stylists, and the closest Lewis ever got to being a great drummer was getting a few pointers from his father's friend Buddy Rich. This two-albums-on-one-CD release shows the unfairness of that neglect. Apart from &quot;This Diamond Ring,&quot; a song originally written with the Drifters in mind (who rejected it, as did Bobby Vee) which became a monster debut hit single, there's a lot of worthwhile, breezy pop/rock among the 16 tracks here. Lewis and company -- Dave Walker, Dave Costell, Al Ramsay, and John R. West -- do okay by covers of &quot;Needles and Pins,&quot; &quot;Sweet Little Rock 'n Roller,&quot; &quot;All Day and All of the Night,&quot; &quot;Dream Lover,&quot; &quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,&quot; &quot;Concrete and Clay,&quot; etc. Two instrumental rarities, the original B-side off of &quot;This Diamond Ring,&quot; &quot;Hard to Find (Leroy's Tune),&quot; and its replacement, &quot;Tijuana Wedding&quot; -- a &quot;La Bamba&quot;/&quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot; piece of nonsense credited to Gary Lewis and producer and musical director Snuff Garrett and Leon Russell -- fill out the CD, and are interesting for showing the band just jamming in the studio, rather than shooting for pop music perfection. The annotation is very thorough, and the sound, from 1998-era transfers, is excellent.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:jjftxqyjldhe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:jjftxqyjldhe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReview for This Diamond Ring: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxfoxqw5ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fxfoxqw5ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReview for A Session With Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gvfixqq5ldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gvfixqq5ldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000I7IG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000I7IG&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
