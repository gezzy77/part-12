But her fortune does her no good when, one horrible night, Chicago is engulfed in flames. Tom Silver will walk through fire to avenge a terrible injusticeÃ¢â‚¬â€and he may have to. But when he makes Deborah a pawn in his revenge, the heat of the inferno fades next to the attraction he feels for his captive. And the further he takes her from everything she's known, the stronger their passion grows, until it threatens to consume them both.\n\nBook 2 - The Mistress\nThen fire sweeps through the city, cornering the young lovers with no hope of rescue. Desperate to share their last moments together, Kathleen and Dylan impulsively marry. Incredibly, they survive. Now, as the fire burns down to cold ash, Kathleen must tell Chicago's most eligible bachelor that he has married a fraud. But the joke's on her. For this gentleman is no gentleman. While Kathleen had hoped to win Dylan's love, he had planned only to capture her heart and steal her fortune. Dylan Kennedy -- con artist, gambler, and ne'er-do-well -- has been unwittingly caught in his own game. Now the real sparks are about to fly.\n\nBook 3 - The Firebrand\nAnd Lucy Hathaway is running for her life. As she rushes past a fine hotel engulfed in flames, a wrapped bundle tumbles from a window into her arms. Seconds later the building crumblesÃ¢â‚¬â€and Lucy is astonished to discover the swaddled blanket contains a baby. Five years later Lucy walks into Rand Higgins's bank and knows: the orphan she rescued that day actually belongs to this ruthless financier. Now, to keep the child she's come to love, she'll have to give up her hard-won freedom and become his wife. But giving Rand her heart? That, she could never have expected.\n\n                       Note: No Table Of Contents\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n        **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302d08ef3efaf38ff183d603057aa4b827d9a8e0","amp;dn":"Great+Chicago+Fire+Trilogy+by+Susan+Wiggs+%28Complete%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302d08ef3efaf38ff183d603057aa4b827d9a8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,45,8,239,62,250,243,143,241,131,214,3,5,122,164,184,39,217,168,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
