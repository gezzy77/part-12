It contains all of the half-truths, fake trivia, amazing made-up facts, and molemanic lore as the paper edition, narrated here almost entirely by Resident Expert John Hodgman, occasionally interrupted by this veritable extravaganza of illustrious and sometimes presumptuous guests: Dick Cavett, Jonathan Coulton, Zach Galifianakis, Ricky Gervais, Ira Glass, Robin Goldwasser, Rachel Maddow, Paul Rudd, Paul F. Tompkins, and Sarah Vowell. PLUS: This recording includes ALL 700 MOLE-MAN NAMES as they were written and subsequently performed LIVE BEFORE A STUDIO AUDIENCE in an underground lair in Brooklyn, N.Y.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92db7dd0542b9c3cfbd39cbc27fe5a1c38725379","amp;dn":"John+Hodgman+-+More+Information+Than+You+Require","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92db7dd0542b9c3cfbd39cbc27fe5a1c38725379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,219,125,208,84,43,156,60,251,211,156,188,39,254,90,28,56,114,83,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
