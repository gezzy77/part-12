STREET FIGHTER EX\n2. STREET FIGHTER EX PLUS (a.k.a. STREET FIGHTER EX PLUS ALPHA)\n3. STREET FIGHTER EX 2 \n4. STREET FIGHTER EX 2 PLUS\n\n\nStreet Fighter EX/PLUS\n---------------------- \nStreet Fighter EX is a head-to-head fighting game with 3D graphics, originally released as a coin-operated arcade game for the Sony ZN hardware in 1996. It is a spin-off of the Street Fighter series co-produced by Capcom with Arika and was the first game in the series to feature polygon graphics. It was followed by an updated arcade version titled Street Fighter EX Plus, as well as a PlayStation-exclusive home version titled Street Fighter EX Plus ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±, both released in 1997.\n\nGameplay\n--------\nThe Street Fighter EX fighting system uses fighting systems of the Street Fighter II and Street Fighter Alpha series. In many ways, EX still plays like a 2D fighting game, but the linear plane in which characters fight often changes along a 3D battleground. The game uses special moves and super combos familiar or similar to previous games in the series. Like in Alpha and Darkstalkers, the super combo gauge, used to do Super Combos and other moves, was divided into three levels. The game introduces various new features to enhance the player's combat choices.\n\nAside from throwing the opponent or wearing away their life by using special moves to drain it, another way to fight blocking is the &quot;Guard Break&quot;. The Guard Break is a move that, if it connects with the blocking opponent, breaks the block and makes the opponent dizzy. The Guard Break can be used at any time with one level of the super combo gauge. In EX3, The Guard Break is changed into the Surprise Blow, which still stuns enemies on contact and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need a level of the super combo gauge to work. However, unlike the previous Guard Break move, the move is guardable while standing up and stuns only if it's used on a crouching opponent.\n\nA Special Move can be done after a Regular Move or another Special Move, this is called a &quot;Canceling&quot;. In the process of doing a Super Combo, another Super Combo can be performed. This is called a &quot;Super Canceling&quot; and can be done with Super Combos.\n\nCharacters\n----------\nWith a total of 18 new characters in the three games of the Street Fighter EX series, this represents the largest original set of characters introduced in a single Street Fighter series.\n\nDefault characters\n\n    * Ryu (voiced by Katashi Ishizuka)\n    * Ken (v.b. Tetsuya Iwanaga)\n    * Chun-Li (v.b. Yuko Miyamura)\n    * Zangief (v.b. Wataru Takagi)\n    * Guile (v.b. TesshÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ Genda)\n\n    * Hokuto (v.b. Yuri Amano)\n    * D. Dark (v.b. Wataru Takagi)\n    * Pullum (v.b. Chika Sakamoto)\n    * C. Jack (v.b. Banjo Ginga)\n    * Skullomania (v.b. Issei Futamata)\n\nHidden characters\n\n    * Akuma (Gouki in Japan, v.b. Tomomichi Nishimura)\n    * Blair (v.b. Hikari Tachibana)\n    * Allen (v.b. Osamu Hosoi)\n    * Kairi (v.b. Kaneto Shiozawa)\n    * Darun (v.b. Takashi Nagasako)\n\nBosses\n\n    * Garuda (v.b. Osamu Hosoi)\n    * Bison (Vega in Japan, v.b. Tomomichi Nishimura)\n\n\nStreet Fighter EX Plus\n----------------------\nA few months after the original version of Street Fighter EX was distributed to the arcades, an upgraded version titled Street Fighter EX Plus was released to the arcades on March 1997. In this version, all the hidden time-released characters are available by default, as well as Garuda and Bison, who were exclusively computer-controlled characters in the original game. This version also adds four new hidden characters, Evil Ryu from Street Fighter Alpha 2, an alternate version of Hokuto named &quot;Bloody Hokuto&quot; and two cyborgs named Cycloid ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â² and Cycloid ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â³.\n\n\nStreet Fighter EX 2/PLus\n-------------------------\nStreet Fighter EX2 is a 2D head-to-head fighting game with 3D graphics, co-produced by Capcom and Arika originally released in 1998 as a coin operated arcade game for the Sony ZN-2 hardware. It is a sequel to the original Street Fighter EX, a 3D spinoff of the Street Fighter series. An updated version of the game titled Street Fighter EX2 Plus was released in 1999 for the arcades as well and subsequently ported to the PlayStation. \n\nGameplay\n--------\nThe original version of Street Fighter EX2 retains all the features from the previous game, Street Fighter EX Plus, including original features such as &quot;Guard Breaks&quot; (unique moves which cannot be blocked by an opponent) and &quot;Super Canceling&quot; (the ability to cancel a Super Combo into another Super Combo).\n\nThe primary new feature in the game are &quot;Excel Combos&quot;, (&quot;excel&quot; being abbreviation for &quot;extra cancel&quot;). Much like the &quot;Custom Combos&quot; featured in the Street Fighter Alpha series, Excel Combos allows player to connect a series of basic and special moves for a limited time. During an Excel Combo, the player begins with a basic move and can follow up with a different basic move or follow-up a basic move with a special move, which can be followed by a different special move. However, the player cannot connect any move with the same move, nor can they cancel special moves into basic moves during an Excel Combo.\n\nCharacters\n----------\nRecurring Street Fighter characters Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Zangief and Guile, who were all in the original Street Fighter EX, return for EX2, along with original characters Hokuto, Skullomania, Doctrine Dark and Cracker Jack. Dhalsim, who was in the PlayStation version of Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha, also returns along with four additional classic characters new to EX series: Blanka and Vega from previous Street Fighter games, along with new characters Sharon (a redheaded female special agent) and Hayate (a Japanese swordsman). Darun, Pullum, Blair, and Allen, were omitted from the original Street Fighter EX 2, although Pullum and Darun would return in Street Fighter EX2 Plus (see below), while Blair and Allen would be featured in an unrelated Arika-developed fighting game titled Fighting Layer.\n\nThe game also features four hidden characters: Kairi from the original EX returns as a hidden challenger, along with new characters Shadow Geist (a costumed vigilante similar to Skullomania) and Nanase (Hokuto and Kairi's sister, a young girl who wields a staff). Garuda is also from the original EX, returning as a boss character. All four characters can be selected by the player after meeting certain requirements\n\nEX 2 PLUS\n---------\nAn enhanced version, titled Street Fighter EX2 Plus, was released for the arcades a year after the original Street Fighter EX2. The game retains all the characters from the original game, with the exception of Hayate, who was removed from the game. Nanase now serves as a regular character in his place. Bison, along with Pullum Purna and Darun Mister, who were all excluded from the original Street Fighter EX2, returned in EX2 Plus. Sagat makes his debut in the EX series along with new characters Vulcano Rosso (an Italian martial artist) and Area (a young girl equipped with a large mechanical arm). A non-selectable version of Bison named &quot;Bison II&quot; appears in the game as a final opponent in the single-player mode.\n\nIn addition to the Super Combos and Excel Combos in the original EX2, EX2 Plus also features &quot;Meteor Combos&quot;, more powerful Super Combos which can only be performed filling up all three stocks of the Super Combo gauge. While the previous EX games feature characters who had Lv.3-only Super Combos, in EX2 Plus it became a standard feature for all the characters, with each character having at least one Meteor Combo. The Excel Combo system from the original EX2 was also slightly revised. The player can now connect a basic move or special move into the same move instead of being limited to a different move.\n\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamesdbase.com/gamedetail-arcade.street_fighter_ex.1996.capcom_co__-46-____-44-___ltd__-46-__.fighting.capcom_co__-46-____-44-___ltd__-46-__.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamesdbase.com/gamedetail-arcade.street_fighter_ex.1996.capcom_co__-46-____-44-___ltd__-46-__.fighting.capcom_co__-46-____-44-___ltd__-46-__.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamesdbase.com/game.aspx?mame=sfex2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamesdbase.com/game.aspx?mame=sfex2&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/street-fighter-ex-plus-alpha/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/street-fighter-ex-plus-alpha/screenshots&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/street-fighter-ex-2-plus/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/playstation/street-fighter-ex-2-plus/screenshots&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHow To Start The Game:\n----------------------\nJust double-click the mameuifx32.exe and the double-click on any of the games from the list of available games. \n\n...................................................................................\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
