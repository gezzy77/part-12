Full credits for the miniseries are by Jesse L McCann (Author), Jeff Albrecht (Author), Dave Tanguay (Author), Min S Ku (Illustrator). McCann in particular is known for his all-ages work on Looney Tunes, The Simpsons and Futurama comics and he keeps the story light and brisk. It's a fun read and if you are a fan of Krypto, it is definitely worth checking out. Plot summary - &quot;As the Last Pup of Krypton arrives on Earth, he meets his host family and new friend Kevin, and fights crime!&quot;\n\nThis is all six issues in digital format thanks to Empire. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c6c35177ddd3eaae32037b3765fb0dc95ceca7c","amp;dn":"Krypto+The+Superdog+01-06+%282006-2007%7CDigital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c6c35177ddd3eaae32037b3765fb0dc95ceca7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,108,53,23,125,221,62,170,227,32,55,179,118,95,176,220,149,206,202,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
