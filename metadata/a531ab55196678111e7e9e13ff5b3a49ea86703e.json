It is basically every ebook I could find online.  It's not perfect, but you have a lot to choose from.\n\nIf you have any to suggest, or if I've made a mistake, comment, and I'll get around to fixing it.  Also, I'm going to at least try to keep up on the ongoing series, so I would expect new torrents from me.\n\nSome books probably don't have vampires as the main thing, but if it had vampires at all I've included it. Same thing goes with series, even if one book in the series is focused on vampires, and the others aren't, I've included the whole series because it wouldn't be nice to have the one book, and then have to go searching for the rest.\n\nI've had to .rar them by authors so TPB would accept the torrent.\n\nSymbol Guide:\n[1] - Single Book\n[S-C] - Completed Series\n[S-O] - Ongoing Series\n[S-U] - Series of Unknown Completion\n\nThis took a week to build... a very long week\n\n\n\nAll files are in pdf format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a531ab55196678111e7e9e13ff5b3a49ea86703e","amp;dn":"Vampire+Ebook+Collection+-+HUGE%21+.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a531ab55196678111e7e9e13ff5b3a49ea86703e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,49,171,85,25,102,120,17,30,126,158,19,255,91,58,73,234,134,112,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
