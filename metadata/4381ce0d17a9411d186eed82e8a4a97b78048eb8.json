Presenting the latest research by biologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the post-Columbian network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico CityÃ¢â‚¬â€where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interactedÃ¢â‚¬â€the center of the world. In this history, Mann uncovers the germ of today's fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars. In 1493, Mann has again given readers an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Barnes &amp; Noble\nIf Charles C. Mann's 1491 was the 'before' of the New World, his 1493 is the 'after'. Unlike scores of other histories, this narrative doesn't retread the familiar voyages and treks of Christopher Columbus. Instead, Mann focuses on the radical ecological re-groupings on both sides of the Atlantic caused by the &quot;Columbian Exchange.&quot; He shows how this biological revolution had far-reaching consequences, devastating Imperial China, and raising centers like Manila and Mexico City into new prominence. A fresh view of a time-honored topic.\n\nGregory McNamee\nMann's book is jammed with facts and factoids, trivia and moments of great insight that take on power as they accumulateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[1493], fascinating and complex, exemplary in its union of meaningful fact with good storytelling, ranges across continents and centuries to explain how the world we inhabit came to be.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nMeet the Author\nCharles C. Mann, a correspondent for The Atlantic, Science, and Wired, has written for Fortune, The New York Times, Smithsonian, Technology Review, Vanity Fair, and The Washington Post, as well as for the TV network HBO and the series Law &amp; Order.
