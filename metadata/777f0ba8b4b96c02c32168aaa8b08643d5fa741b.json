For too many Catholics, Confession is just a means to an end: cleaning us up from sin so we can receive Communion. But, as Pope Francis tells us, Confession is much more than &quot;going to the dry cleaner.&quot; It s &quot;an encounter with Jesus, who waits for us as we are.\r\n\r\nIn his years of speaking all over North America, Flynn saw that many Catholics have this limited appreciation of Confession, and the urgent need for clear teaching about this great Sacrament. If you have not yet experienced Confession as a wonderful, personal encounter with Christ; if you do not yet look forward to going to Confession with the same eagerness and expectation with which you receive Holy Communion, this book is for you. It will be a whole new way of going to Confession, inviting you to begin an exciting personal journey to healing and holiness. It may change your life.\r\n\r\nConfession has been called the Sacrament of the New Evangelization. It is the sacred encounter with Christ where we experience God s mercy and forgiveness. Vinny Flynn helps make even more accessible this beautiful sacrament of healing. Those who read this short but insightful book should be able to approach the Sacrament of Confession with greater love, fervor and gratitude and come away convinced that they are not only forgiven but truly healed and liberated. 7 Secrets of Confession is a helpful tool in the ongoing challenge of the New Evangelization. I am happy to recommend it to every Catholic and confessor.\r\n--Cardinal Donald Wuerl, Archbishop of Washington D.C.\r\n\r\nVinny Flynn s 7 Secrets are like seven explosions that blow away the obstacles keeping us from the Sacrament of Mercy. If you ve ever dragged your feet on the way to confession, gotten discouraged about confessing the same sins over and over, or wondered how your confessions could be more fruitful, then you ll love this book. It turns what many see as a tiresome obligation into a precious, longed-for encounter with the Lord.\r\n--Fr.
