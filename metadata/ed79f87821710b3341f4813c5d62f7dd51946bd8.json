They were the pinnacles of a traditionÃ¢â‚¬â€dating from the early RenaissanceÃ¢â‚¬â€of commemorating betrothal, marriage, and the birth of a child by commissioning extraordinary objects or exchanging them as gifts. This important volume is the first to examine the entire range of works to which Renaissance rituals of love and marriage gave rise and makes a major contribution to our understanding of Renaissance art in its broader cultural context. Some 140 works of art, dating from about 1400 to 1600, are discussed by a distinguished group of scholars and are reproduced in full color.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed79f87821710b3341f4813c5d62f7dd51946bd8","amp;dn":"Art+and+Love+in+Renaissance+Italy+%28Art+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed79f87821710b3341f4813c5d62f7dd51946bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,121,248,120,33,113,11,51,65,244,129,60,93,98,247,221,81,148,107,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
