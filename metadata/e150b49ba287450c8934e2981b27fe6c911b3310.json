What makes this special is the spotlight on Narvin Kimball, the group's oldest member. Kimball sings many of these songs, most of which are love songs, and his performances give the album a warm, appealing quality, even if his singing isn't technically perfect. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. You Can Depend On Me\n02. Mama Don't Allow It\n03. Girl Of My Dreams\n04. Coquette\n05. Petite Fleur\n06. Because Of You\n07. True (You Don't Love Me)\n08.
