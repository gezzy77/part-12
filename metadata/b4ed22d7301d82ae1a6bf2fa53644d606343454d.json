Convincing others that one 'knows what he's talking about' can help win clients, gain allies, make sales, and much more. But tricks and shortcuts, like peppering conversation with jargon or random facts, can seem transparent at best, and often work against one's intent. This field-tested book gives readers a comprehensive process for quickly taking in small amounts of information in a given area, and knowing how to use it to convey familiarity. This book allows readers to generate amazing rapport with anyone by honing in on the one subject that interests them most: their own area of expertise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ed22d7301d82ae1a6bf2fa53644d606343454d","amp;dn":"HOW+TO+BECOME+AN+EXPERT+ON+ANYTHING+IN+TWO+HOURS+-+pdf+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ed22d7301d82ae1a6bf2fa53644d606343454d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,237,34,215,48,29,130,174,26,107,242,250,83,100,77,96,99,67,69,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
