Thankfully, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been beavering away on The Believer in what she terms Ã¢â‚¬Ëœstolen momentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢: taken together, these snatched seconds form a stunning solo debut.  The Believer was recorded with a full band that includes her former Alphastates cohort Gerry Horan on guitar, keyboards and drums, with Karl Odlum on bass and a stunning string duo in Marja Gaynor and Kevin Murphy, along with Brian Barnes on backing vocals.\n\n  Title-track and album opener, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe BelieverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, is an insistent three minutes of driving guitars, thumping drums and CatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soaring vocal. Her voice is an incredible instrument, somehow combining the lilt of PortisheadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Beth Gibbons and the sneer of a young Polly Harvey, as she shifts gears and genres with equal panache, from the exquisite orchestral pop of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCruelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, through the dark energy of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSomebody ElseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the pastoral Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe RulesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and on to the Sigur RÃƒÂ³s-like majesty of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Well Runs DryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the waltzing lullaby of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSing You To SleepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which closes things with a warm glow.  The highlights come when she kicks back with the deliciously downbeat, scuzzy electronica that forms much of the album, including the masterful Ã¢â‚¬ËœCome OnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the BjÃƒÂ¶rk-esque Ã¢â‚¬ËœInvisibleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the eastern tinge on the ironically-titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœGospel SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the stunning Ã¢â‚¬ËœHuntersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, where gorgeous, choral vocals are overlaid on gently undulating synths and deliciously lo-fi drumbeats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134bad4d2295352b7b196ca68cc4560dca4cbc42","amp;dn":"Cat+Dowling+-+The+Believer+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134bad4d2295352b7b196ca68cc4560dca4cbc42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,75,173,77,34,149,53,43,123,25,108,166,140,196,86,13,202,76,188,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
