Known today as a safe haven for New Yorkers yearning for relief from the stresses of their chaotic metropolis, history records that Central Park was built on a useless swamp, yet as the New York City skyline hurtled towards the sky over the last 150 years, making the city the most expensive real estate in the world, the park has remained untouched. Why? Civic pride? Perhaps, but the recent strange happenings in and around the park are casting doubt on that, doubts that require investigating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc580cd21bc6deb04377177f95cbc5320bb77fee","amp;dn":"Alone+in+the+Dark+RF+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc580cd21bc6deb04377177f95cbc5320bb77fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,88,12,210,27,198,222,176,67,119,23,127,149,203,197,50,11,183,127,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
