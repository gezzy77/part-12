A child is found wandering through the snowy woods, her hands covered in someone else's blood.\n\nAuthorities suspect the child is the kidnapped daughter of real estate tycoon Michael McLaughlin. Once they realize she is far too young to be the missing teenager, they reach a dead end in identifying the girl, who either cannot or will not speak. The only adult she seems to trust is the young officer who found her, Detective Lucy Black. A frenzied investigation to find the McLaughlins' daughter and to discover the name of the mysterious child is ignited when it becomes apparent that the two cases are linked. As Lucy digs deeper and deeper into the case, she is forced to question not only the persons of interest, but everything she thought she knew about her own past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c92e0515a181d0046ebdba5cdc17896fcf98d4","amp;dn":"Little+Girl+Lost+-+Brian+McGilloway+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c92e0515a181d0046ebdba5cdc17896fcf98d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,201,46,5,21,161,129,208,4,110,189,186,92,220,23,137,111,207,152,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
