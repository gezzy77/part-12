Who are they and what do they do?\n\nThis volume focuses on the deities whose mantra recitation and colorful visualizations lie at the heart of the Tantra. We meet goddesses of wisdom, the prince of purity, the lotus-born guru Padmasambhava, and dakinisÃ¢â‚¬â€ wild-haired women who dance in the flames of freedom. All, the peaceful and the wrathful alike, urge the reader to break through to wisdom, pointing out the true nature of reality with uncompromising vigor.\n\nDevoid of pop culture misperceptions, this guide is a window into the sometimes mysterious world of Buddhist Tantra. Vessantara explores the key characteristics of the Tantra in this magical fusion of the practical and the imaginativeÃ¢â‚¬â€giving us a direct insight in into the poetry and the power of the Tantra.\n\nA much-published and well-respected Buddhist author, meditator, and teacher, Vessantara is a senior member of the Western Buddhist Order. He holds a particular love for Tibetan Buddhism and is well-known as an effective storyteller. This is one of three volumes looking at Buddha figures in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition.&quot;\n\nThis torrent contains a very good quality PDF copy of the book, which seems to be from a digital source. I have done conversions into EPUB, MOBI, AZW3 and LIT formats as well in Calibre, which all came out quite readable. The front cover image and generated metadata.opf file are also included. NOTE - I have dated the folder and files as being released in 2013; however, that is an error, as that is the publication date for the digital (Kindle) version and not the actual physical book itself. The correct release date is 2008, so please feel free to adjust it accordingly. Please seed and enjoy!\n\nPlease visit and support my Suprbay release thread here, I would appreciate it:       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-VikTSlick-s-Comics-Releases&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd07d7cddee3a0121d0437cdf6a5c5ab8713b87","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+the+Deities+of+the+Tantra+%28Meeting+the+Buddhas%29+%282008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd07d7cddee3a0121d0437cdf6a5c5ab8713b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,208,125,124,221,238,58,1,33,208,67,124,223,106,92,90,184,113,59,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
