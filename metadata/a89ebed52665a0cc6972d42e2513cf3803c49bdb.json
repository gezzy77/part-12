Can you survive this deadly dungeon of dance? Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection.&quot;\n\nI had a problem with the 3DM version of this game which was uploaded here on tpb before. More specifically, the game just quit when I picked up almost any item (e.g., a sword in the tutorial). So I downloaded this version from small-games.info, and it works fine. If you, like me, are having problems with the 3DM version of this game, try this version.\nAnd remember, if you like the game, support the developer, buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89ebed52665a0cc6972d42e2513cf3803c49bdb","amp;dn":"Crypt+of+the+NecroDancer+v0.370+%28via+small-games.info%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89ebed52665a0cc6972d42e2513cf3803c49bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,158,190,213,38,101,160,204,105,114,212,46,37,19,207,56,3,196,155,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
