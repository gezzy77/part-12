For more than 20 years, Gregg Braden, the best-selling author of The God Code, has searched for evidence of a forgotten form of prayer that was lost to the West following the Biblical edits of the early Christian Church. In the 1990s, he found and documented this form of prayer still being used in the remote monasteries of central Tibet. He also found it practiced in sacred rites throughout the high deserts of the American Southwest.\n \nIn Secrets of the Lost Mode of Prayer, Braden begins by describing this ancient form of prayer that has no words, or outward expressions. Then for the first time in print, he leads us on a journey exploring what our most intimate experiences tell us about our deepest beliefs. Through case histories and his personal sharing, Braden explores the wisdom of these timeless secrets, and the power that awaits each of us, just beyond our deepest hurt! \n\n\nHardcover: 224 pages\nPublisher: Hay House (January 1, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1401906834\nISBN-13: 978-1401906832","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb18e2567abade95034c223073bde650c14976e","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Lost+Mode+of+Prayer%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb18e2567abade95034c223073bde650c14976e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,177,142,37,103,171,173,233,80,52,194,35,7,59,222,101,12,20,151,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
