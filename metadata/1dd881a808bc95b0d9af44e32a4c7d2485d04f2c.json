It is also somewhat inevitably one that has generated a huge flow of literature in the decades that have passed since the events themselves. However, until now, historians of the revolution have had no dedicated bibliography of the period and little claim to bibliographical control over the literature. emThe Russian Revolution and Civil War, 1917-1921/emoffers for the first time a comprehensive bibliographical guide to this crucial and fascinating period of history. The Bibliography focuses on the key years of 1917 to 1921, starting with the February Revolution of 1917 and concluding with the 10th Party Congress of March 1921, and covers all the key events of the intervening years. As such it identifies these crucial years as something more than simply the creation of a communist state","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd881a808bc95b0d9af44e32a4c7d2485d04f2c","amp;dn":"The+Russian+Revolution+and+Civil+War+1917-1921%3A+An+Annotated+Bib","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd881a808bc95b0d9af44e32a4c7d2485d04f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,216,129,168,8,188,149,176,217,175,68,227,42,76,125,36,133,208,79,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
