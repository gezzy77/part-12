Released as a \ndouble album on 30 November 1979, it was subsequently performed live with elaborate theatrical \neffects, and adapted into a feature film, Pink FloydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Wall.\n\nAs with the band's previous three studio albums The Wall is a concept album, and deals largely with \nthemes of abandonment and personal isolation. It was first conceived during the band's 1977 In the \nFlesh Tour, when bassist and lyricist Roger Waters's frustration with the spectators' perceived \nboorishness became so acute that he imagined building a wall between the performers and audience. \nThe album is a rock opera that centres on Pink, a character based on Waters or maybe Syd Barrett. \nPink's life experiences begin with the loss of his father during the Second World War, and continue \nwith ridicule and abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother and finally, the breakdown \nof his marriage. All contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by \na metaphorical wall.\n\n\n\n   1. Pink Floyd - In the Flesh?                              [03:21]\n   2.
