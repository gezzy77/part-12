It teaches rythem and has the children pick out the &quot;wrong&quot; notes in a piece of music after having listened to it.  It is not difficult, it is appx 4 measures of music and also has the notes on a staff!  IT is a great beginning exposure to music for the homeschooling family who has NO musical background....\n\nUse Ultra ISO (or your preferred software) and mount to virtual drive and use OR burn to cd.  No serial keys etc required...
