It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach number 5 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching number 4 on the American charts. The album was #1 for two weeks on the Australian album chart and was listed as the #1 album of 1968 by Cash Box in the year-end album chart in the U.S. The album features the two singles &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.\n\nThe title of the album is based on a malapropism. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, &quot;it's got them Disraeli Gears&quot;, meaning to say &quot;derailleur gears&quot;, but instead alluding to 19th-century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album.\n\nIn 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2003 the album was ranked number 114 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time in 2001. In 2008, the album won a Classic Rock Roll of Honours Award for Classic Album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08e787115d8e0af5c4eee2a01812ceab1524b2cb","amp;dn":"Cream+-+Disraeli+Gears+%28Japan+Platinum+SHM-CD+%282013%29+FLAC+Beolab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08e787115d8e0af5c4eee2a01812ceab1524b2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,231,135,17,93,142,10,245,196,238,226,160,24,18,206,171,21,36,178,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
