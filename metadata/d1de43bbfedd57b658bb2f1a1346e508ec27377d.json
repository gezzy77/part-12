When were cows domesticated and why do we feed their milk to our children? Where were the first cities and what made them succeed? Who invented math-or came up with money?\n\nThe history of humanity is a history of invention and innovation, as we have continually created new items to use, to admire, or to leave our mark on the world. In this original and thought-provoking book, Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, has selected one hundred man-made artifacts, each of which gives us an intimate glimpse of an unexpected turning point in human civilization. A History of the World in 100 Objects stretches back two million years and covers the globe. From the very first hand axe to the ubiquitous credit card, each item has a story to tell; together they relate the larger history of mankind-revealing who we are by looking at what we have made.\n\nHandsomely designed, with more than 150 color photographs throughout the text, A History of the World in 100 Objects is a gorgeous reading book and makes a great gift for anyone interested in history.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1de43bbfedd57b658bb2f1a1346e508ec27377d","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+World+in+100+Objects+-+Neil+MacGregor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1de43bbfedd57b658bb2f1a1346e508ec27377d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,222,67,187,254,221,87,182,88,187,47,26,19,70,229,8,236,39,55,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
