Those who memorize matrix numbers and session lists will absolutely adore this 1965-1967 collection of odds and sods by L.A.'s psychedelic-garage heroes the Seeds: 66 minutes' worth of ephemera, ready to be pored over. More casual listeners might find it rather slow going; despite the inclusion of several great songs, like the phenomenally powerful &amp;quot;Satisfy You&amp;quot; and a weirdly stripped-down alternate take of the trippy &amp;quot;March of the Flower Children,&amp;quot; there's much here that's only of interest to die-hard fans, like the plodding ten-minute-plus jam &amp;quot;900 Million People Daily&amp;quot; and a chaotic rehearsal take of &amp;quot;Pushin' Too Hard.&amp;quot; Complete novices in particular should avoid this album because it presents too skewed a picture of the group; better to start with one of the more traditional compilations and work up to this should you get hooked.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Stewart Mason, All Music Guide\n\nlÃƒÂ¥tlista\n\n1.
