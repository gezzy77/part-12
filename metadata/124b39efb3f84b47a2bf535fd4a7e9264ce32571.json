Anyway, looking at the movie from this year&amp;#039;s perspective it&amp;#039;s perfectly safe to say that PG-13 Hollywood of today would be almost too progressive with flicks like this one, not to say smart. \n\nHope you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it because I certainly did. Years passed looking for this forgotten gem, with no DVD edition - as far as I&amp;#039;m aware - on the Amazon. For that matter, I still don&amp;#039;t have ANY idea on which torrent site I found this Rush&amp;#039;s film. At the same time, don&amp;#039;t worry about quality; if it&amp;#039;s not DVDRip it&amp;#039;s picture-perfect PDTV-rip. (Hope you&amp;#039;re also downloading the streets of san francisco [first two seasons] from this site; another bang-up 70s crime show....)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:124b39efb3f84b47a2bf535fd4a7e9264ce32571","amp;dn":"Freebie+and+the+Bean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"124b39efb3f84b47a2bf535fd4a7e9264ce32571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,75,57,239,179,248,75,71,162,191,83,95,212,167,233,38,76,227,37,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
