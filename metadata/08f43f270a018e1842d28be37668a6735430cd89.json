The Cold War is heating up: McCarthyism, with all its fear and demagoguery, is raging in the nationâ€™s capital, and Joseph Stalinâ€™s death has left a dangerous power vacuum in the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe CIA, meanwhile, is reeling from a double agent within their midst. Someone is selling secrets to the Soviets, compromising missions around the globe. Undercover agents have been assassinated, and anti-Communist plots are being cut short in ruthlessly efficient fashion. The CIA director knows any news of the traitor, whose code name is Protocol, would be a national embarrassment and compromise the entire agency.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mueller seems to be the perfect man to help find the mole: Yale-educated; extensive experience running missions in Eastern Europe; an operative so dedicated to his job that it left his marriage in tatters. The Director trusts him. Mueller, though, has secrets of his own, and as he digs deeper into the case, making contact with a Soviet agent, suspicion begins to fall on him as well. Until Protocol is found, no one can be trusted, and everyone is at risk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f43f270a018e1842d28be37668a6735430cd89","amp;dn":"An+Honorable+Man+-+Paul+Vidich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f43f270a018e1842d28be37668a6735430cd89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,244,63,39,10,1,142,24,66,210,139,227,118,104,166,115,84,48,205,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
