But don't take our word for it; listen to the pros: &quot;This album is the \nthird best resource for jokes by Dan Telfer.&quot; -Patton Oswalt &quot;I love Dan \nTelfer. He is wonderful. He is like a goofier, smarter, funnier, taller, me with \nglasses. And male parts.&quot; -Maria Bamford &quot;If you're one of those people who \nlikes being reminded that you'll never be as funny as Dan Telfer, go ahead \nand listen to this album! I won't - it just makes me sad.&quot; -Scott Aukerman \n&quot;Dan Telfer gave me a ride in his car once.&quot; -Doug Benson &quot;Dan Telfer has an \nalbum? Of comedy? Please check it out and send me a review on the internet. \nI'm sure it's great. He's very funny, super smart and nice.&quot; -Brian Posehn \n&quot;One time I tried to help Dan break into a cemetery. His comedy chops are \nvastly superior to his B&amp;E skills.&quot; -Kyle Kinane &quot;Of all the performers I've \nknown over the years, Dan Telfer, more than any of them, seems the most \ncompelled to do stand-up comedy. ÃƒÂ¡And I don't think it's because of some \ndeep-seated need for attention, or because he's seeking love from strangers \nthat was denied him as a child; I think he needs to do stand-up comedy \nbecause he can't be alone with his own thoughts. ÃƒÂ¡Coincidentally, he's \nhilarious.&quot; -Paul F. Tompkins\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265316a448e9426347d65c13bd43c6a179f6bcbd","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Tendrils+of+Ruin+-+Dan+Telfer+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265316a448e9426347d65c13bd43c6a179f6bcbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,83,22,164,72,233,66,99,71,214,92,19,189,67,198,161,121,246,188,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
