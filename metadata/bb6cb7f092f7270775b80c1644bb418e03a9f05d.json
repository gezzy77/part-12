Jena et al. (WSP, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nWhile the field of clusters and nano-structures in the physical sciences has been actively pursued only over the past two decades, nature has known the benefits of the nanoscale for a very long time. The focus of the International Symposium on Clusters and Nano-Assemblies: Physical and Biological Systems was to explore ways in which an understanding of the unique properties of nano-scale biological systems such as proteins, enzyme reactions, RNA, and DNA can help us design novel materials composed of inorganic nano-scale systems, and how techniques developed in the physical sciences can lead to a fundamental understanding of biological systems. Bringing together the expert contributions from the conference, this book deals with the fundamental science and technology of atomic clusters, nano-structures and their assemblies in physical and biological systems. It explores in fascinating detail the manner in which finite size, low dimensionality, and reduced symmetry affect the properties of nano-assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\nContents:Atomic ClustersOrganic and Molecular ClustersCatalysisQuantum Dots/RingsNano-Wires and TubesMagnetic PropertiesElectrical and Optical PropertiesClusters on SupportNano-Growth on Strained Surfaces/Nano-AssembliesBiology at Molecular LevelBiotechnology\r\nReadership: Graduate students, researchers and academics in nanoscience and nanotechnology, chemistry and physics.\r\nKeywords:Clusters;Nano-Assemblies;Biotechnology;Clusters-on-Support;Quantum Dots;CatalysisKey Features:An exploration into how the unique properties of nano-scale biological systems can aid in the designing of novel materials composed of inorganic nano-scale systemsBrings into focus the outstanding problems and future directions of atomic clusters, nano-structures and their assemblies in physical and biological systemsIncludes researchers working on surfaces, interfaces, clusters, and nano-structures in the physical and biological sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6cb7f092f7270775b80c1644bb418e03a9f05d","amp;dn":"Clusters+And+Nano-Assemblies+-+Physical+And+Biological+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6cb7f092f7270775b80c1644bb418e03a9f05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,108,183,240,146,247,39,7,117,184,12,22,68,187,65,142,3,169,240,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
