This will open the backup wizard. The wizard will ask you to select a source drive and a backup drive. The source drive is the main hard drive of your computer where all your saved information and programs are. This is usually drive C but may be multiple drives as well.\n\t3 \nChoose a backup drive. The backup drive is either an internal or external hard drive onto which you want to save a copy of your files.
