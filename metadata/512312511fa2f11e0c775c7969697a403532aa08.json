Also included are a handful of instrumentals and original compositions. Most of the album is sung in the affected country crooning voice that Dylan had introduced a year earlier on Nashville Skyline. Seen by some as intentionally surreal and even satirical at times, Self Portrait received extremely poor reviews upon release; Greil Marcus' opening sentence in his Rolling Stone review was: &quot;What is this shit?&quot; \n\nDylan has claimed in interviews that Self Portrait was something of a joke, far below the standards he set in the 1960s, and was made to get people off his back and end the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot; tags.\n\nDespite the negative reception, the album quickly went gold in the US, where it hit #4, and it gave Dylan yet another UK #1 hit before it fell down the charts. The album has since built a cult following and saw a retrospective positive re-evaluation with the release of The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971) in 2013.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;All the Tired Horses&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n    &quot;Alberta #1&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:57\n    &quot;I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know&quot; (Cecil A.
