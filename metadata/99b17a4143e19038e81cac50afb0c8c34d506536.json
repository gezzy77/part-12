The original voice of Iron Maiden, and the front man of such bands as Killers, Battlezone and Gogmagog, arises to bring his fans a show of sheer heavy metal brutality! Paul DiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Anno returned to Poland in April to play a string of live shows. One of the shows Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  at Lizard Club in KrakÃƒÂ³w on April, 9th Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was recorded for the purposes of a live DVD release Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Beast ArisesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nThe material from the DVD captures a sensational live show in a club full of audience that would not let DiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Anno leave the stage for a long time. The release features mind-blowing performances of the classic material from the first two Iron Maiden studio albums, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Iron MaidenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“KillersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as well as songs by Killers, Battlezone, and, to top it off, a fierce cover of RamonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blitzkrieg BopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all this making for an outstanding show that will leave no fan in doubt that the Beast has truly risen! The DVD also includes an interview with Paul DiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Anno, a photo gallery and other extras.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Beast ArisesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been set for release on October, 6th in Europe and October, 7th in North America (via MVD). Formats available: DVD, CD and double LP (December, 2nd).\n\n\n\n\n\nDi'Anno recorded two classic albums with IRON MAIDEN before being fired and replaced by Bruce Dickinson. He went on to front a number of other bands, including KILLERS and BATTLEZONE, and released several solo records.\nAsked why he thinks his two LPs with MAIDEN became timeless and iconic in the rock history, Di'Anno told Spotlight Report: &quot;I think because when we started, the whole punk thing was so bloody huge, which I loved and still love punk to this day, and the heavier music just became so distant; they called it dinosaur rock back in the day.&quot;\nHe continued: &quot;When we got signed and the whole New Wave Of British Heavy Metal started, that's what really kicked off what we have today. If it wasn't for MAIDEN and bands like SAXON, MOTÃƒâ€“RHEAD, etc., you would never have had bands like METALLICA, SLAYER, MEGADETH and ANTHRAX. If you didn't have those bands, you would never have had SEPULTURA, MORBID ANGEL and then PANTERA, etc. So at the time, they were just bloody good albums, but in the history of things, they really kicked off what started for anything today that has heavy guitar. And yeah, they are timeless. Those albums still sell millions. You don't see the crap that was around then still selling shit, like SHAKIN' STEVENS or SPANDAU BALLET, do ya?&quot;\n\n\nPaul Di'Anno Discography:\n\n[b]with Iron Maiden[/b]\n   The Soundhouse Tapes (1979)\n   Live!! +one (1980)\n   Iron Maiden (1980)\n   Killers (1981)\n   Maiden Japan (also known as Heavy Metal Army) (1981)\n   Live at the Rainbow (VHS, 1981)\n   The First Ten Years (VHS, 1990)\n   From Here to Eternity (VHS, 1992)\n   The Story So Far Part One (Boxset, 1995)\n   Best of the Beast (1996)\n   Eddie Head (Boxset, 1998)\n   Eddie's Archive (Boxset, 2002)\n   The Early Days (DVD, 2004)\n\nwith Di'Anno\n  Live at the Palace (VHS, 1984)\n   Di'Anno (1984)\n       &quot;Flaming Heart&quot; (1984)\n       &quot;Heartuser&quot; (1984)\n   Nomad (2000)\n   Live at the Palace (DVD, 2005)\n\nSolo\n   The World's First Iron Man (1997)\n   As Hard as Iron (1997)\n   Beyond the Maiden (1999)\n   The Masters (1999)\n   The Beast (Live, 2001)\n   The Beast in the East (DVD, 2003)\n   The Living Dead (a re-release of Nomad with bonus tracks, 2006)\n   The Maiden Years - The Classics (2006)\n   Iron Maiden Days and Evil Nights (2007)\n   The Early Iron Maiden Songbook (2010)\n\nwith Battlezone\n   Fighting Back (1986)\n   Children of Madness (1987)\n   Warchild (1988)\n   Feel My Pain (1998)\n   Cessation of Hostilities (Compilation with all three studio albums Battlezone released + Children of madness demo tracks and one new live track, 2001)\n   The Fight Goes On (Boxset including all three Battlezone studio albums, 2008)\n\nwith Killers a.k.a.
