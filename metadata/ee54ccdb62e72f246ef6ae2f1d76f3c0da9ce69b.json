Foster and Leon Kreitzman draw on remarkable recent scientific advances to explain how seasonal change affects organisms, and how plants and animals over countless generations have evolved exquisite sensitivities and adaptations to the seasons. The authors also highlight the impact of seasonal change on human health and well-being. They conclude with a discussion of the dangers posed when climate changes disrupt the seasonal rhythms on which so much life depends.\n\nSurprising facts from Seasons of Life:\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe timing of human birth has a small  but significant effect on various later life attributes, such as handedness and the susceptibility to many illnesses, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œPlants have the ability to measure the length of a period of light, and they germinate, flower, and successfully reproduce by using this information.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œBirds migrate not in response to weather changes but by using an internal calendar.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œUntil recently, human birth was tightly coupled to the seasons, peaking in many societies in the spring.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œJust as internal 24-hour circadian clocks predict daily change, many animals have a circannual clock in their brains that predicts the seasons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee54ccdb62e72f246ef6ae2f1d76f3c0da9ce69b","amp;dn":"Seasons+of+Life+-+Russell+Foster+%26amp%3B+Leon+Kreitzman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee54ccdb62e72f246ef6ae2f1d76f3c0da9ce69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,84,204,219,98,231,47,36,110,246,174,47,29,118,243,192,218,156,230,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
