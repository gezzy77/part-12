Again, Barrington \nPheloung's arrangements of classical source material is meticulously \nimpeccable. The list includes selections from Mozart (The Magic Flute \nand the Piano Concerto, K488), Wagner (Wesendonk-Lieder and \nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tterdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤mmerung) and Brahms (String Sextet No 1). As always they \nrepresent a fine insight into Morse's struggling thoughts at the \nrelevant time. The composer's own material is atypically restrained. \nAlthough he can bang out the action when called for, these three volumes \nhave all sustained a respectable quietude-- symbolising, perhaps, \nMorse's preferred state of living a quiet life. --Paul Tonks\n\n01.
