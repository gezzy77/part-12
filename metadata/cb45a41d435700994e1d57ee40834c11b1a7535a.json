S. military and colleges joined forces, fielding competitive teams to prepare men for combat. The book highlights the Department of the Navy's role in preserving the game and football's impact on national morale and the war effort through their &quot;Lend-Lease&quot; to colleges of officer candidates, including All-America and professional players.
