In this volume a team of experts discusses Herodotus' Histories and their influence. Topics covered include their relationship to Homer, their view of the natural world, their methodology and the Herodotean narrator. Each chapter presents the most up-to-date scholarship on Herodotus and offers a guide to further reading on the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:510a635e53332deb9881e2e063f3fba2b45a574b","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Herodotus.pdf++%5Bnuneral%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"510a635e53332deb9881e2e063f3fba2b45a574b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,10,99,94,83,51,45,235,152,129,226,224,99,243,251,162,180,90,87,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
