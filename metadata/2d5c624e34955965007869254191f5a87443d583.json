The LP shifts between the kind of brooding drone-folk associated with Six Organs of Admittance or Espers (see Spirit Modules, Season of Serpents), and gloriously chunky Deep Purple-esque riffage (Native Dreams).\n\nThe roughness and immediacy with which The Sun DogsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ elements are interwoven is key to its character: flute, strings and organ, combined with some darkly atmospheric male backing vocals, are alternately laid over narcotic heavy rock grooves and ritualistic folk. Ultimately however, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rabia Shaheen QaziÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrestingly powerful, Grace Slick-style vocals that welds these constituents together. Rose Windows demonstrate that, in the right hands, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still possible to conjure new life with the tools of classic rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d5c624e34955965007869254191f5a87443d583","amp;dn":"Rose+Windows+-+The+Sun+Dogs+%5B2013%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d5c624e34955965007869254191f5a87443d583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,92,98,78,52,149,89,101,0,120,105,37,65,145,245,168,116,67,213,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
