While the new monarchy can win power, it cannot win hearts in an England that plots for the triumphant return of the House of York.\nHenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest fear is that somewhere a prince is waiting to invade and reclaim the throne. When a young man who would be king leads his army and invades England, Elizabeth has to choose between the new husband she is coming to love and the boy who claims to be her beloved lost brother: the rose of York come home at last.\n\nFollow me @livhre\n\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.
