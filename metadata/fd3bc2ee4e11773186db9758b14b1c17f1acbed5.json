A while after he arrives at the airport, he feels that something's wrong. He follows two men into the luggage room. They both try to kill him, but he kills one and the other gets away. He gets the dead guy's fingerprints and faxes them to his friend Al Powell over in L.A. The man's name was Oswald Cochrane, and he had been officially dead for two years. John then realizes that someone is about to screw around with the airport, and he's correct. Colonel Stuart, a man who got &quot;canned by congress&quot;, as McClane says it, and his team of ex-commandos have taken control of the airport, shutting down the Instrument Landing System and the runways. He then threatens to cause plane crashes unless the plane carrying Ramon Esperanza from Valverde (the fictitious country used in Commando (1985)) lands at a runway of his designation. The Chief Engineer and the airport's S.W.A.T. team unsuccessfully try to restore communications with the planes above. Because of this, Stuart crashes a plane. McClane must now try to defeat the terrorists and save his wife before her plane, and all the other planes, run out of fuel.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Hard With a Vengeance (1995) 720p\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864&lt;/a&gt; [User Rating:7.4/10] [User Rating:7.4/10]\n\n[FORMAT]:.......................[ Matroska\n[GENRE]:........................[ Action | Thriller\n[FILE SIZE]:....................[ 550 MiB\n[NO OF CDs]:....................[ 1\n[RESOLUTION]:...................[ 1248 x 528\n[ASPECT RATIO]:.................[ 2.35\n[FRAME RATE]:...................[ 23.976 fps\n[LANGUAGE ]:....................[ English\n[SUBTITLES]:....................[ none\n[ORIGINAL RUNTIME]:.............[ 02:08:31\n[RELEASE RUNTIME]:..............[ 02:08:31\n[SOURCE]:.......................[ Die Hard With a Vengeance 1995 BluRay 720p x264 DTS WiKi\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img265/8266/qosubc.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img265/8266/qosubc.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img101/9817/e7kql2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img101/9817/e7kql2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img576/415/9tzhfl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://a.imageshack.us/img576/415/9tzhfl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nJohn McClane is now almost a full-blown alcoholic and is suspended from the NYPD.

John has faced some brutal terrorists in his career, but now, he's about to face what may be his most dangerous enemy yet. John, who occasionally does jobs for the United States Department of Homeland Security,receives a call to bring in a hacker named Matt Farrell, because there has been a breach in an FBI computer system. Farrell is one of the many hackers who are suspected in the attack, and all known hackers are to be questioned. But after John gets to Matt's apartment, a group of men show up and try to kill John and Matt, who barely escape with their lives. As it turns out, a group of terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel are systematically shutting down the United States computer infrastructure. They crash the stock market, crippling America's economy. It turns out that Matt knows enough about hacking to know exactly how Gabriel is shutting down the USA. Gabriel, a disgraced former Department of Defense employee, plans to bring the country to its knees, but he doesn't count on John and Matt figuring out what's going on. Gabriel wants John and Matt out of the way, and for John, the situation becomes personal when an enraged Gabriel kidnaps John's daughter Lucy, who is a student at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Gabriel may think he now has the upper hand on John, but he has no idea how far John is willing to go to rescue Lucy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd3bc2ee4e11773186db9758b14b1c17f1acbed5","amp;dn":"Die+Hard+Quadrilogy+-+720p+MKV+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd3bc2ee4e11773186db9758b14b1c17f1acbed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,59,194,238,78,17,119,49,134,219,151,88,177,75,28,23,241,172,190,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
