Their popular Australian singles are &quot;Undecided&quot;, &quot;Living in a \nChild's Dream&quot;, &quot;5:10 Man&quot;, &quot;Think About Tomorrow Today&quot;, &quot;Turn Up Your \nRadio&quot; and &quot;Because I Love You&quot;. The band launched the career of \nbass guitarist, Glenn Wheatley, later a music industry entrepreneur \nand an artist manager for both Little River Band and John Farnham. The \nband reformed periodically, including in 1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1988 and again subsequently \nthey were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association \n(ARIA) Hall of Fame in 1998 alongside The Angels. Both Keays, with His \nMaster's Voice and Wheatley, with Paper Paradise, wrote memoirs in 1999 \nwhich included their experiences with the band\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01.
