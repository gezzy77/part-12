For the next 30 years, smaller spatial quakes plague the world on an irregular basis. In the present, Shido Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high schooler comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spatial quake. He learns from his adopted sister Kotori that the girl is one of the &quot;Spirits&quot; from different dimension whom are the real cause of the spatial quakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the real world. Shido's intelligent classmate, Origami Tobiichi, is a sergeant of the AST (Anti-Spirit Team) special unit designed to suppress the threat posed by Spirits to exact revenge of her parents' deaths. He also learns that Kotori is the commander of the airship , crewed by the organization , and is recruited to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers thus stopping them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal a Spirit's power, he must make her fall in love with him and make her kiss him. As Shido successfully keeps sealing more and more Spirits, he gains allies to help him with his dates with other spirits. Shido also increases the competition among them for his attention and affection, much to his chagrin.\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nVideo Source: Blu ray\r\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nCodec: AC3\r\nTrack 1: English 5.1ch (AC3 640bit)\r\nTrack 2: Japanese Stereo (AC3 640bit)\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\nExtras\r\nDate A Live English Commentary (4,7)\r\nDate A Live II English Commentary (1,6)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97814b66032ffa8c2947ffac9ff4539a9ffe5194","amp;dn":"Date+A+Live+S1%2CS2+%28BDRip+1080p+AC3%29+Dual+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97814b66032ffa8c2947ffac9ff4539a9ffe5194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,129,75,102,3,47,250,140,41,71,255,172,159,244,83,154,159,254,81,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
