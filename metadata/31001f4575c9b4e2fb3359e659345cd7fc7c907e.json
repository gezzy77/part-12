Chet made quite a few albums which suffer from bad sound or bad playing (either by him due to drugs or inferior sidemen). Here everything falls into place. The sound is great, Chet is supported by a very sensitive, inventive trio and is in top form himself. There is a companion album to this and if you like Chet Baker at all both are an absolute MUST for you. Chet himself thought that his playing got better with the years - unlike those critics who would have us believe that everything he did after Mulligan was not worth listening to. I agree with Chet and this album (recorded, I think, in the year of his death) bears witness to the fact that this was one of the great trumpet players of all time.&quot; \n\n&quot;I was one of those Chet Baker fans who only bought his early recordings. A few attempts to give his later years a try had me back at the used-CD bin, making a deposit.This Tokyo recording, made in the last year of his life, shows that he still had it...big time. His level of playing seems to be inversely related to his physical appearance of that last year. This &quot;living ghost&quot; of Chet sounds strong and clear, lyrical; at times,very fast, and still with that great sense of phrasing. His vocals are surprizingly good.The quality of the sound in this live recording is very good. Also, Harold Danko is outstanding.&quot;\n\n&quot;This CD was recorded less than a year before his death yet he sounds better than ever both on the trumpet and voice. This disk combines a fair number of up-tempo cuts with Chet showing surprising speed on his horn. Of course the ballads are mastered here like only Chet can. The sonics of the recording are 5 star all the way. If you love Chet, you'll love this CD.&quot;\n\nBreezin says: &quot; there are several versions of this CD, a 2CD set with the whole concert and this one with just the highlights. In any case, even a true Genius needs inspiration, and the outstanding Dutch musicians who play with Chet on this recording have more or less formed a band with him during a prolongued period of time when he lived in Amsterdam. True Genius only comes to life when all the right people and all the necessary things around him/her fall in place. And exactly that is what is happening on this recording. \n\nJUST GET IT!!!!!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
