And more Im just remembering off the top of my head all this Led Zeppelin had In through the out door. John Bonham was alive and well. Anyway I had some music to deliver if you want more of that Hah too bad, You had to live it to really get it. Net is cool but some things had to be lived it adds the true feeling.
