Sharrock's visceral aggression and monolithic sheets of noise were influenced by the screaming overtones of saxophonists like Coltrane, Sanders, and Ayler, and his experiments with distortion and feedback predated even Jimi Hendrix. Naturally, he provoked much hostility among traditionalists, but once his innovations were assimilated, he enjoyed wide renown in avant-garde circles.\n\nTracklist\n (all compositions by Sonny Sharrock)\n1 &quot;Promises Kept&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“9:43\n2 &quot;Who Does She Hope to Be?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4:41\n3 &quot;Little Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“7:12\n4 &quot;As We Used to Sing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“7:45\n5 &quot;Many Mansions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“9:31\n6 &quot;Once upon a Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6:26\n\nPersonell:\nSonny Sharrock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ electric guitar\nPharoah Sanders ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tenor &amp; soprano saxophones\nElvin Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums\nCharnett Moffett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ double bass\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b6f5978b4828b635db62536c3e62c28b92b3bdc","amp;dn":"Sonny+Sharrock+Ask+The+Ages+%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b6f5978b4828b635db62536c3e62c28b92b3bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,111,89,120,180,130,139,99,93,182,37,54,195,230,44,40,185,43,59,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
