It demonstrates the incredible intelligence of these wonderful animals that sadly are still killed and eaten as bushmeat when in truth they share 99% of our own DNA and are so close to us in intelligence and behaviour that many people think they deserve human rights.\n\nThe next part of her story is A Conversation with Koko - 1999, bringing the story 20 years further up to date. I'll be sharing that too shortly.
