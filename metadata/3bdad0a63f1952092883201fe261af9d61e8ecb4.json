As the British sifted through the rubble, people grabbed cameras to capture what it meant to stand up to Hitler throughout the Blitz. And as the Nazi army slogged through the mud and snow of Soviet Russia on the way to Moscow, soldiers used 8mm cameras to film the hardships of the war as they experienced it. This was not the stock, newsreel or propaganda footage from World War II that authorities approved and audiences became accustomed to seeing. This was provocative and sometimes disturbing footage taken by those who witnessed the war first-hand. This was the footage deemed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unfitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for civilians to see. At the end of the war, this and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTop SecretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ footage of the warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s destruction was stashed away and forgotten.\n\nThanks to the efforts of a few, private collectors and archivists, these forgotten films have been rediscovered, restored and made available by National Geographic Channel in an extraordinary six-part series: Apocalypse: The Second World War, in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of World War II. In addition to stunning footage, the series presents WWII in an innovative and provocative way, giving audiences an unprecedented sense of the reality of war not conveyed by black and white footage.\n\nMade up entirely of original 35mm, 16mm and 8mm films, Apocalypse: The Second World War includes rare footage of the Polish officersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ massacre at Katyn, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, the inhumane treatment of French soldiers taken prisoner by the Nazis and the sacrifice of Soviet soldiers at Stalingrad. By bringing this incredible footage together, Apocalypse: The Second World War provides viewers with a ground-breaking portrait of WWII that depicts not only its complexity, but the perspectives of both its victims and its victors. \n\nEPISODES 1: \n\nTHE AGGRESSION \n\nGermany. 1939. When almost nothing seems to stand in his way, and with the USSR as his ally, Hitler invades Poland. Britain and France declare war while the U.S. maintains its neutrality. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Phoney WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begins as millions of civilians wait to see if the conflict will resolve itself and Germany builds up its arsenal. The Aggression features fascinating, colourised footage of Hitler as he visits the Austrian village where he grew up (and the children still run barefoot), as well as footage shot by Eva Braun, his mistress, of the FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer relaxing at his Alpine chalet. Witness haunting images of the persecution of the Jews in the Lodz Ghetto in Poland, StalinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gulags for political prisoners, and the magnificent city of Strasbourg emptied of its residents. Watch heart-felt good-byes as French soldiers leave loved ones at Gare de lÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Est train station in Paris and civilians ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ young and old ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as they prepare for air raids by donning gas masks. As Hitler continues his conquest of Europe, he invades Holland and Belgium and plans to make a surprise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsickle cutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ through the dense Ardennes Forest, leaving the Allies with little chance of escape.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 46mn 54s 384ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nSubtitles         : None\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 248 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 368 (1.696) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 123 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdad0a63f1952092883201fe261af9d61e8ecb4","amp;dn":"Apocalypse-The+Second+World+War.%282008%29.1of6.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bdad0a63f1952092883201fe261af9d61e8ecb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,218,208,166,63,25,82,9,40,131,32,31,226,97,175,157,97,232,236,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
