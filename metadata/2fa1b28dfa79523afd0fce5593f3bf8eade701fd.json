David Woods\n\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, twenty four daring men journeyed from Earth to the Moon. This fascinating book traces what was a massive accomplishment right from the early launches through manned orbital spaceflights, detailing each step. Out of the battlefields of World War II came the gifted German engineers and designers who developed the V-2 rocket, which evolved into the powerful Saturn V booster that propelled men to the Moon. David Woods tells this exciting story, starting from America 's postwar astronautical research facilities. The techniques and procedures developed have been recognised as an example of human exploration at its greatest, demonstrating a peak of technological excellence.\n\n2008\nPDF\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa1b28dfa79523afd0fce5593f3bf8eade701fd","amp;dn":"How+Apollo+Flew+to+the+Moon+%281st+edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa1b28dfa79523afd0fce5593f3bf8eade701fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,161,178,141,250,121,82,58,253,15,206,85,147,243,191,142,173,231,1,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
