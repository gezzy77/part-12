In this case the THD peak bitrate\nis 1302k with an average of 1141k and should have been transcoded to a higher\nbitrate than core\nOur release uses ref 5 to &quot;respect Level 4.1&quot;. The rules sadly lack when it comes\nto ref in 1080p for FS sources. &quot;vertical resolution is greater than 864, then 4\nmust be used to respect L4.1&quot;. That is true for WS sources however for FS sources\nref 5 is actually what &quot;respects L4.1&quot;. Rules assume (wrongly) a constant horiziontal\nresolution of 1920 which isn't valid for scene 1080p as the sides are cropped off\nUnder the current rules both are ok cause of the conflicting wording - ref 4 is specified\nas well as &quot;must respect L4.1&quot;\nA calculation Formula can be found in &quot;high.definition.x264.standards.revision.3.1.addendum.1&quot;: ref = 12288 * 1024 / (vertical resolution * horizontal resolution * 1.5)\n\nTomorrow's just your future yesterday!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9d504335b5f039e04bc360628539c49ce89b59","amp;dn":"Sunset.Blvd.1950.PROPER.1080p.BluRay.x264-AMIABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d9d504335b5f039e04bc360628539c49ce89b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,157,80,67,53,181,240,57,224,75,195,96,98,133,57,196,156,232,155,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
