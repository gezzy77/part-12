My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)\n\n\n\nTo clarify the &quot;language&quot; of this concert, there really is no speaking in it, and the singing in it is in Armenian, but that language choice was not available in the drop-down list, so I selected Russian as Russian is the defacto second language of Armenia.\n\nThe Shoghaken Ensemble, ArmeniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preeminent folk ensemble, is captured for the first time, live in concert on DVD. Shoghaken has appeared throughout the world, presenting authentic Armenian music and dance in the most prestigious halls of Europe and the USA, including sold-out concerts at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Carnegie Hall, Theatre de la Ville in Paris, Kennedy Center, Kimmel Center, Skirball Center, Cleveland Museum and the Rudoslstadt Festival in Germany, White Nights Festival in St. Petersberg, Russia and the Smithsonian Folk Festival in Washington D.C. \n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9c297529c3eced38573acb71c3500328dd9b8c2","amp;dn":"Shoghaken+Ensemble+Concert+-+Armenian+Folk+Music+%26+Dance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9c297529c3eced38573acb71c3500328dd9b8c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,194,151,82,156,62,206,211,133,115,172,183,28,53,0,50,141,217,184,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
