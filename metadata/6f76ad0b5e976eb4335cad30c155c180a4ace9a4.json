Her one-of-a-kind cakes and cookies are not only served with ice cream, they get crumbled on top and incorporated into the ice cream base itself.\nSundae combinations dazzle with bold and inspired sauces, such as Whiskey Caramel and Honey Spiked with Chilies. And JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crunchy Ã¢â‚¬Å“gravelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (crumbly sundae toppings)Ã¢â‚¬â€such as Salty Graham Gravel and Everything Bagel GravelÃ¢â‚¬â€are unlike toppings anyone has ever seen before.\nStore-bought ice cream can be used for all the desserts in the book, but it will be hard to resist JeniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthrough recipes for dairy-free ice cream, frozen custard, and soft-serve. Thirty brand-new flavors, including Cumin &amp; Honey Butterscotch and Extra-Strength Root Beer Ice Cream, attest to the magic of this unique and alluring collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f76ad0b5e976eb4335cad30c155c180a4ace9a4","amp;dn":"Splendid+Ice+Cream+Desserts+by+Jeni+Britton+Bauer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f76ad0b5e976eb4335cad30c155c180a4ace9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,118,173,11,94,151,110,180,51,92,173,48,193,85,193,128,164,172,233,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
