The Primary Axiom is the foundational evolutionary premise -- that life is merely the result of mutations and natural selection. In addition to showing compelling theoretical evidence that whole genomes must in fact degenerate over time, this book strongly refutes the Darwinian concept that man is just the result of a random and pointless natural process. This is an updated version of the October 2005 edition, which includes both a new appendix and glossary.\n\nPaperback: 248 pages\nPublisher: FMS Publications; 3rd edition (March 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0981631606\nISBN-13: 978-0981631608","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39768bb9d896940d4b3eb35f7b8411b8a4350ea","amp;dn":"Genetic+Entropy+and+the+Mystery+of+the+Genome+-+John+Sanford+-+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39768bb9d896940d4b3eb35f7b8411b8a4350ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,151,104,187,157,137,105,64,212,179,235,53,247,184,65,27,138,67,80,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
