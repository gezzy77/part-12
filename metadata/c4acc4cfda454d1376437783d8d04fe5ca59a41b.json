I was headed down a dark and dangerous road where he was concerned and in the end, our relationship was inevitable. Despite our dark secrets, our feelings for each other burned brighter than a thousand stars and left us both naked, vulnerable. But when my past came rolling back into my life like a Summer storm, I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure if his love for me was enough.\n\nWas he prepared to deal with the consequences of a past I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t regret or would he walk away with my beating heart in his hands? \nGenre: Contemporary Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4acc4cfda454d1376437783d8d04fe5ca59a41b","amp;dn":"Precious+Consequences+-+Bester%2C+Tamsyn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4acc4cfda454d1376437783d8d04fe5ca59a41b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,172,196,207,218,69,77,19,118,67,119,131,216,208,79,229,202,89,164,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
