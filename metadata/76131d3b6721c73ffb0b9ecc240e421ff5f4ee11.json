But does Darwins theory function on a purely mathematical level?\n\nHas there been enough time for evolution to produce the remarkable biological diversity we see around us? Its a question no one has yet answeredin fact, no one has even attempted to answer it until now.\nIn this illuminating and provocative book, Gregory Chaitin argues that we cant be sure evolution makes sense without a mathematical theory. \n\nHe elucidates the mathematical scheme hes developed that can explain life itself, and examines the works of mathematical pioneers John von Neumann and Alan Turing through the lens of biology. Chaitin presents an accessible introduction to metabiology, a new way of thinking about biological science that highlights the mathematical structures underpinning the biological world. Fascinating and thought-provoking, Proving Darwin makes clear how biology may have found its greatest ally in mathematics.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , Science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76131d3b6721c73ffb0b9ecc240e421ff5f4ee11","amp;dn":"Proving+Darwin%3A+Making+Biology+Mathematical+by+Gregory+Chaitin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76131d3b6721c73ffb0b9ecc240e421ff5f4ee11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,19,29,59,103,33,199,63,251,11,158,204,36,14,66,31,245,244,238,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
