Beyond the Top-25 stories, additional chapters delve further into timely media topics: The Censored News and Media Analysis section provides annual updates on Junk Food News and News Abuse, Censored Deja Vu, signs of hope in the alternative and news media, and the state of media bias and alternative coveragearound the world. In the Truth Emergency section, scholars and journalists take a critical look at the US/NATO military-industrial-media empire. And in the Project Censored International section, the meaning of media democracy worldwide is explored in close association with Project Censored affiliates in universities and at media organizations all over the world.\n\nA perennial favorite of booksellers, teachers, and readers everywhere, Censored is one of the strongest lifesigns of our current collective desire to get the news we citizens need--despite what Big Media tells us.\n\nSeries: Censored\nPaperback: 432 pages\nPublisher: Seven Stories Press (October 8, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1609804945\nISBN-13: 978-1609804947\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
