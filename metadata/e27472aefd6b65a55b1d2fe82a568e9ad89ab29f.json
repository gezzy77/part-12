He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you're looking for other books by Thomas Merton, I've uploaded several -- search for thomas merton on tpb or click on my user name to find them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27472aefd6b65a55b1d2fe82a568e9ad89ab29f","amp;dn":"Thomas+Merton+-+The+Sign+of+Jonas+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27472aefd6b65a55b1d2fe82a568e9ad89ab29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,116,114,174,253,107,101,165,91,29,47,232,42,86,142,154,216,154,178,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
