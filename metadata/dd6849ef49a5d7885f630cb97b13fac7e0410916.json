She also reveals herself to be capable of temperature raising, orgasmic moans at the end of the (up to that point) Stevie Wonder-like &quot;Morning Loving.&quot; True Spirit succeeds in drawing on older R&amp;B vibes and making them sound fresh. \nMulti-instrumentalist Ian Green (who also produced) gives Anderson musical backdrops that range from bluesy to funky to sultry. The lyrics are literate and sophisticated, balancing a focus on romantic relationships (&quot;Ain't Givin' Up on You,&quot; the title track) and socially conscious concerns (&quot;Mama Said,&quot; &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;). Anderson's vocals are arresting icing on the cake, particularly haunting on the dramatic ballad &quot;Only One for Me.&quot; \nTrue Spirit is a gorgeous album that constantly draws in the listener, both musically and spiritually.
