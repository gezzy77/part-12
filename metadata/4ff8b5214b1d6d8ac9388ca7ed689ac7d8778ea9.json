Miller is best known as a bassist, working with trumpeter Miles Davis, singer Luther Vandross, and saxophonist David Sanborn, as well as maintaining a prolific solo career. Miller is classically trained as a clarinetist and also plays keyboards, saxophone and guitar.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img97.imageshack.us/img97/5624/marcusmiller.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img97.imageshack.us/img97/5624/marcusmiller.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOne of the downfalls of trying to capture a live video performance of a singular night is that it puts a lot of pressure on the musicians to play it safe and not take risks and screw up. Even though the performance is impeccably clean and the solos are good, it doesn't even come close to the energy captured on the 'Ozell Tapes' (Marcus' live double CD, recorded over a whole tour). Don't get me wrong; the ensemble has it's moments and any Marcus Miller fan will dig it but it's not going to make you drop your jaw and consider breaking your bass in two (or maybe it will, I don't know). If you're familiar with all of Marcus' work you're not going to hear anything completely fresh and innovative. Maybe I've been listening to too much Art Tatum lately. I'm sure people will disagree but that's my opinion. That being said Marcus Miller is still the best electric bass player on the planet (no, I didn't forget Victor Wooten). His tone, compositional skill, and improvisational MUSICALITY are second to none and that counts for more than super-flashy chops any day of the week. This is still a great introduction if you're new to MM and it's worth it to have a copy in your library. Also in regards to the overall production; the video, audio and editing are very good and the interview section is what you'd expect. \n\n0===========================0\n\n.: Info Ripping :.\n\nDimensione: 1,483 MB\nDurata:  02:10:19\n\nVideo Codec:  XviD\nVideo Bitrate:  1362 kb/s\nRisoluzione:  688x528 \nFPS: 25.000\nQF:  0.150 bits/pixel\n\nAudio Codec:  ac3\nAudio Bitrate:  224 kb/s (stereo) CBR\nFreq Audio:  48000 Hz ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff8b5214b1d6d8ac9388ca7ed689ac7d8778ea9","amp;dn":"Marcus+Miller+-+Master+of+all+trades+%5BDVDrip+Ac3%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff8b5214b1d6d8ac9388ca7ed689ac7d8778ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,248,181,33,75,29,109,138,201,56,140,167,237,104,154,199,216,119,142,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
