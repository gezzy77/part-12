Hillis Miller, and Harold Bloom).  At the time of his death from cancer, he was Sterling Professor of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale.\n\nDe Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable for many years, in no small part owing to his many influential students.  After his death, the discovery of some two hundred articles he wrote during World War II for collaborationist newspapers, including one explicitly anti-Semitic, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* AESTHETIC IDEOLOGY (University of Minnesota Press, 1996).  Edited with an Introduction by Andrzej Warminski.\n\n* ALLEGORIES OF READING: FIGURAL LANGUAGE IN ROUSSEAU, NIETZSCHE, RILKE AND PROUST (Yale University Press, 1979).\n\n* THE RESISTANCE TO THEORY (University of Minnesota Press, 1986).  Foreword by Wlad Godzich.\n\nAlso included here are 4 essays originally published in &quot;Yale French Studies&quot; and &quot;Modern Language Notes&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8c8aee7345abc1b42843778100373ea165ce42","amp;dn":"Paul+de+Man+-+Selected+Literary+Criticism+%283+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8c8aee7345abc1b42843778100373ea165ce42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,140,138,238,115,69,171,193,180,40,67,119,129,0,55,62,161,101,206,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
