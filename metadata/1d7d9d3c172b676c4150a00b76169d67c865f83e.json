For each volume, a series editor reads pieces from hundreds of periodicals, then selects between fifty and a hundred outstanding works. That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind.\n\nThe Best American Short Stories has been in publication since 1915 making it the oldest continuous series of its type. Starting in 1986 additional titles were added covering the best in essays, sports writing, nature writing and more - all of which now fall under the general title of The Best American Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d7d9d3c172b676c4150a00b76169d67c865f83e","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+AMERICAN+MYSTERY+STORIES+2002-2003+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d7d9d3c172b676c4150a00b76169d67c865f83e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,125,157,60,23,43,103,108,65,80,160,11,118,22,157,103,200,101,248,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
