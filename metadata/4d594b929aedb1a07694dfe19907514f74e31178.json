SEAL Target Geronimo is the story of Neptune's Spear from the men who were there. After talking to members of the SEAL team involved in the raid, Pfarrer shares never-before-revealed details in an exclusive account of what happened as he takes readers inside the walls of Bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compound penetrating deep into the terroristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lair to reach the exact spot where the Al Qaeda leader was cowering when the bullet entered his head. SEAL Target Geronimo is an explosive story of unparalleled valor and clockwork military precision carried out by the most elite fighting force in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€the U.S. NavyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SEAL Team Six.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Barnes &amp; Noble\nFor days and days, the media seemed to dwell on nothing else, repeating the same scant details again and again and again. The May predawn raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden ended an intense ten-year effort by three U.S. presidents and the intelligence agencies of a dozen countries. How this desperate, methodical hunt finally succeeded is the subject of this extraordinary account by the author of Warrior Soul: The Memoir of a Navy SEAL. Author Chuck Pfarrer draws on his hard-won experience as SEAL Team Six element commander to draw out the minute-by-minute account of the raid itself and the details of its painstaking preparations.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nDrawing upon personal experience, extensive research, and interviews with military personnel, former Navy SEAL Pfarrer charts the events that led SEAL Team Six to assassinate Osama Bin Laden in 2011, traces the origin of the Navy SEALs, and details the training and leadership that ultimately gave SEAL Team Six the skills needed to end a decade-long manhunt.Erik Bergman provides solid narration, reading in a voice that is deep, determined, and slightly raspyÃ¢â‚¬â€all of which captures the tone of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prose and spirit of his subject matter.BergmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery also contains a much-needed note of cordiality, which works to balance the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assertion that he and other SEALs are a world apart from average Americans. \n\nMeet the Author\nCHUCK PFARRER is a former assault element commander of SEAL Team Six. He has appeared as an author and counterterrorism expert on Good Morning America, NPR, and Fox News. He lives in Michigan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d594b929aedb1a07694dfe19907514f74e31178","amp;dn":"Chuck+Pfarrer+-+SEAL+Target+Geronimo+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d594b929aedb1a07694dfe19907514f74e31178","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,89,75,146,154,237,177,160,118,148,223,225,153,7,81,79,116,227,17,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
