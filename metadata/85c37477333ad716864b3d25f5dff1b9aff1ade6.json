From the conquest of Mexico by smallpox as much as by the Spanish, to the bubonic plague in China, to the typhoid epidemic in Europe, the history of disease is the history of humankind. With the identification of AIDS in the early 1980s, another chapter has been added to this chronicle of events, which William McNeill explores in his new introduction to this updated editon.\n\nThought-provoking, well-researched, and compulsively readable, Plagues and Peoples is that rare book that is as fascinating as it is scholarly, as intriguing as it is enlightening. &quot;A brilliantly conceptualized and challenging achievement&quot; (Kirkus Reviews), it is essential reading, offering a new perspective on human history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85c37477333ad716864b3d25f5dff1b9aff1ade6","amp;dn":"Plagues+and+Peoples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85c37477333ad716864b3d25f5dff1b9aff1ade6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,195,116,119,51,58,215,22,134,75,61,37,245,223,241,185,175,241,173,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
