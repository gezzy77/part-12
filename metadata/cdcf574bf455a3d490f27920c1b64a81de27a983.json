Started as a form of healing after the devastating L.A. riots in 1992, the South Central Farmers have since created a miracle in one of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most blighted neighborhoods. Growing their own food. Feeding their families. Creating a community.\n\nBut now, bulldozers are poised to level their 14-acre oasis.\n\nThe Garden follows the plight of the farmers, from the tilled soil of this urban farm to the polished marble of City Hall. Mostly immigrants from Latin America, from countries where they feared for their lives if they were to speak out, we watch them organize, fight back, and demand answers:\n\nWhy was the land sold to a wealthy developer for millions less than fair-market value? Why was the transaction done in a closed-door session of the LA City Council? Why has it never been made public?\n\nAnd the powers-that-be have the same response: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe garden is wonderful, but there is nothing more we can do.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIf everyone told you nothing more could be done, would you give up?\n\n* * *\n\nThe Garden has the pulse of veritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© with the narrative pull of fiction, telling the story of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest urban farm, backroom deals, land developers, green politics, money, poverty, power, and racial discord. The film explores and exposes the fault lines in American society and raises crucial and challenging questions about liberty, equality, and justice for the poorest and most vulnerable among us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcf574bf455a3d490f27920c1b64a81de27a983","amp;dn":"The.Garden.2008.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcf574bf455a3d490f27920c1b64a81de27a983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,207,87,75,244,85,163,212,144,242,121,32,193,182,74,129,222,39,169,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
