The then-ubiquitous &amp;#039;Boombastic&amp;#039; from 1995 is still humorously brazen and probably his most well-known song, while later efforts such as &amp;#039;It Wasn&amp;#039;t Me&amp;#039; prove that he could still find success with a variant on this formula. Elsewhere, the Steve Miller-sampling &amp;#039;Angel&amp;#039; and other similarly light-hearted dancehall-inspired efforts ensure that Shaggy&amp;#039;s legacy will be one built on making audiences laugh as well as sing along.\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
