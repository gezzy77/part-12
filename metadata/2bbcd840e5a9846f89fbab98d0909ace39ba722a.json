In Sylvester's home country, the single was his second Top 40 hit, peaking at #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1979. The song also reached #20 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart. A 12&quot; single was released in 1978, with &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot; as the A-side and &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; as the B-side, and these two extended dance mixes proved to be very popular in dance clubs at the time. The two songs held down the top spot on the Billboard Dance/Disco chart for six weeks in August and September of 1978. These two songs helped to establish Sylvester's career as a noted disco and dance music performer, both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\nClassic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bbcd840e5a9846f89fbab98d0909ace39ba722a","amp;dn":"Sylvester+-+Mighty+Real+%5B1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bbcd840e5a9846f89fbab98d0909ace39ba722a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,188,216,64,229,169,132,111,137,251,171,152,208,144,154,206,57,186,114,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
