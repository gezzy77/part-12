Even the song's composer, Irving Berlin, was upset and asked radio stations not to play Presley's version.\n\nThere are moments on this disc when the King seems to playfully mock the sentiments of some of these songs as if to taunt his critics, but for the most part he sounds sincere and never fails to be anything but superb. He breathes startling new life into &amp;quot;Oh Little Town of Bethlehem&amp;quot; and makes &amp;quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&amp;quot; his own. &amp;quot;Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane&amp;quot;) is delightful, and &amp;quot;Santa Claus is Back in Town&amp;quot; is as raunchy in its way as his recording of &amp;quot;One Night.&amp;quot; \n\nThe album is padded out with four sublime gospel recordings originally released on the &amp;quot;Peace in the Valley&amp;quot; EP that break the lighthearted mood a bit, but also place the focus on the season's true meaning. \n\nElvis Presley\nElvis' Christmas Album (Orig 1957 - remastered 1999)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers.\nApprox 71Mb\n\nTracks\n01 Santa Claus Is Back in Town  \n02 White Christmas\n03 Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)\n04 I'll Be Home for Christmas \n05 Blue Christmas  \n06 Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)    \n07 O Little Town of Bethlehem           \n08 Silent Night     \n09 Peace in the Valley     \n10 I Believe    \n11 Take My Hand, Precious Lord    \n12 It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe5806bec0dca04b5ce488db07f13325f064b10","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Elvis%5C%27+Christmas+Album+%281957+remastered+1999%29+%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe5806bec0dca04b5ce488db07f13325f064b10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,229,128,107,236,13,202,4,181,206,72,141,176,127,19,50,95,6,75,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
