It complements the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous books, Fundamentals of Ecotoxicology, Third Edition and Ecotoxicology: A Comprehensive Treatment.\n\nEncouraging a more rigorous inferential approach to research, the book examines the quantitative features of the science of ecotoxicology. The first chapters lay the foundation by introducing fundamental concepts and definitions. The author traces the historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics of scientific ecotoxicology as well as the general measurement process. He also considers methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions from ecotoxicological endeavors.\n\nThe book then discusses ecotoxicological concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization and outlines quantitative methods used to measure toxicant accumulation and effects. Reflecting the importance of establishing type I and type II error rates, it highlights design issues, particularly sample size and power estimation. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicology from a nonregulatory perspective.\n\nExtensively updated, this second edition has been expanded to include terrestrial as well as aquatic ecotoxicology. Requiring only a basic knowledge of statistics, this highly readable book is suitable for graduate students and researchers as well as practicing environmental scientists and engineers. It guides readers to better understand the fate and effects of toxicants in the biosphereÃ¢â‚¬â€and helps them frame this understanding in quantitative terms.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in This Edition\nMore than 40 new figures and 20 new worked examples\nUpdated measurement quality methods and software\nExpanded coverage of synecological models and methods\nMore integration of Bayesian concepts\nAppendices for power analysis and basic matrix methods\nAdditional mixture toxicity and up-and-down methods\nGreatly expanded discussion of significance testing\nExpanded discussion of metapopulations\nMatrix tools for population demography\nLight isotope-based models for trophic transfer of toxicants\nInclusion of metacommunity and SHE analysis techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:809cb5de2269c1a618b67a285db708531d13f7f8","amp;dn":"Quantitative+Ecotoxicology%2C+2E-+Newman+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"809cb5de2269c1a618b67a285db708531d13f7f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,156,181,222,34,105,193,166,24,182,122,40,93,183,8,83,29,19,247,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
