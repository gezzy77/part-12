To update just extract and overwrite previous installation.\n\nRe-uploaded from Kickass. All work done by VIruz.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 01.053.015 (24/10/14)\n\n- fixed issue with rotor/piston staying in control panel after being deleted \n- fixed character crash\n- fixed ownership issue\n- fixed crash with control panel groups\n- fixed crashes related to weapons and shooting/welding/grinding\n\nUpdate 01.053.013 (23/10/14)\n\nSummary:\nIn this update, we added an advanced rotor block that is able to function as a conveyor system and also implemented the option to mod sounds.\n\nThe second important implementation is bug fixing. As Marek Rosa has already written in his latest blog-post, the game is entering into a stabilization period where the amount of new features will be reduced and the focus will be mainly on bug fixing and stabilization of the things that are already in the game. This doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that weekly updates will stop coming or that we are not going to add new features any more. This is just a temporary transition period that will last for a few weeks. There are still many big and important features to be added, but first we want to make sure that the game is free of bugs and in a much more stable state before we start implementing them.\n \n \nFeatures:\n- advanced rotor block\n- sound modding\n \nFixes:\n- fixed memory leaks in character, raycasts and asteroids\n- fixed small ship piston dummies\n- fixed render interpolation issues \n- fixed crash to desktop when pasting blueprint\n- fixed floating object size (components, ore)\n- fixed issue with not functional landing gears\n- fixed missing curved conveyor glass\n- fixed crash when clicking on faction\n- fixed issue when player can't create an asteroid map\n- fixed issue with explosions in older worlds caused by changed rotor offset \n- fixed game crash when declaring war and proposing peace\n- fixed spotlights not illuminating the area correctly\n\nUpdate 01.052.023 (17/10/14)\n\n- fixed small landing gear collision model \n- fixed issue: loading world with many asteroids \n- fixed crash with meteors in world \n- fixed crash caused by turret \n- fixed crash in multiplayer when joining/spawning \n- fixed crash in factions \n- fixed crash in character mods \n- fixed crash caused by floating objects \n- fixed crash when loading invalid audio file \n- fixed crash in assemblers\n\nUpdate 01.052.020 (16/10/14)\n\nSummary:\nAssemblers can now cooperate with each other (when enabled in terminal) by taking items from other assemblerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s queue and help with transferring materials. Volumetric explosions have been also added; things hidden behind armor (or other blocks) will not get destroyed when the armor survives from the explosion. Additionally, players can now help each other with the new Ã¢â‚¬Å“welder option: help othersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - welded blocks will not belong automatically to the player who is helping but to the owner of the ship.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- assembler cooperation\n- volumetric explosions\n- welder setting: help others\n- antenna broadcasting on/off (including character - &quot;O&quot; key)\n- default world size is now 20 km (size can still be changed to Ã¢â‚¬Å“unlimitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in world settings) \n- arc furnace can now refine more metals\n \nFixes:\n- fixed missile explosions right after missile was launched\n- fixed issue with objects not removed when leaving the world\n- fixed respawning of character crossing the world limits\n- fixed broken animations for custom skins\n- fixed cases when components were duplicated by collectors\n- fixed issue with more screens popping up at once\n- fixed auto-save not saving the world regularly\n- fixed view change while pasting modded blueprint\n- fixed game is running before loading screen is closed\n- fixed crash caused by camera view and exiting Remote control\n- fixed custom respawn ship mods not working\n- fixed world corrupted, refinery entity ID replaced\n- fixed sensor triggering action on owned block\n- fixed DS crashed on loading - steamSDK\n- fixed client on DS is not able to join the faction\n- fixed spawned as spectator when loading world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f973c348cc2f94cf9ff225e569c66b3d0460f57","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.053.015+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f973c348cc2f94cf9ff225e569c66b3d0460f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,151,60,52,140,194,249,76,249,255,34,94,86,156,102,179,208,70,15,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
