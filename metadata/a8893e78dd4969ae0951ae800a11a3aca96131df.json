I live in Canada and they live in the United States and after a few phone calls and some email exchanges it became clear that the best way to do this was to make math videos. \n\nI started with the basics with Ã¢â‚¬ËœSeries IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and it sort of grew from there. People liked what I was doing and wanted more so I continued. \n\nThe project has grown to the point that I am now fully committed to creating a curriculum for all of high school mathematics. The plan is to put together packages for all major topics all the way up to and including an introductory course in Probability and Statistics and one for Calculus. \n\nI estimate that this will take me anywhere between 5 to 10 years to complete. \n\n\n\n\n******** TABLE OF CONTENTS ********\n\nThere are three ways to access the table of contents for all the math videos:\n\nThrough chycho.com:\n\nThrough 420math.com:\n\nThrough mathinreallife.com:\n\n\n\n******** SUPPORT THIS PROJECT ********\n\nIf you like what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m doing and would like to help, there are two ways to support this project. \n\nMETHOD 1 - Donations are greatly appreciated and can be made by either going to chycho.com or mathinreallife.com (see right column). LINKS: http://www.chycho.com or http://www.mathinreallife.com\n\nMETHOD 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I believe that the War on Drugs has been and continues to be one of the most destructive forces in our society. It needs to end. You can support this project by supporting one of the organizations listed at 420math (see right column).
