And the best way to do that fixin' is from Old Testament stories narrated by the preacher, played by a black cast, backed by the joyful gospel sounds of the Hall Johnson Choir and based on Marc Connelly's folk-themed Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Rex Ingram portrays de Lawd, who has a 100,000 things to do before any human's next breath - like instructing Noah (Eddie Anderson); taking counsel with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; or teaching Moses tricks to dazzle Pharaoh. Get your mind fixed for The Green Pastures. It's a film of its time. But like all great art, it transcends it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027700/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027700/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nnot my rip, segments of this torrent collected from a number of sources:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dcc9a773eadd16a65e0a12e4eba43dc4acb823f","amp;dn":"The+Green+Pastures+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dcc9a773eadd16a65e0a12e4eba43dc4acb823f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,204,154,119,62,173,209,106,101,224,161,46,78,186,67,220,74,203,130,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
