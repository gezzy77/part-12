Pitchfork identifies it as &quot;the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence&quot; and &quot;redefining what was expected from popular music.&quot;[52] Described by Gould as &quot;woven with motifs of circularity, reversal, and inversion&quot;, Revolver featured sophisticated songwriting and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock. Abandoning the group photograph that had become the norm, its coverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg daysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½was a &quot;stark, arty, black-and-white collage that caricatured The Beatles in a pen-and-ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley.&quot; The album was preceded by the single &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, backed by &quot;Rain&quot;. The Beatles shot short promo films for both songs, described as &quot;among the first true music videos&quot;, which aired on Top of the Pops and The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nAmong Revolver's most experimental tracks was &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, for whose lyrics Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The song's creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the recording studio building, each manned by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data.[131] McCartney's &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; made prominent use of a string octet; it has been described as &quot;a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song.&quot; Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned a place on the record. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham explains, they were very much &quot;studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts.&quot;] The final show, at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August, was their last commercial concert.[135] It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally\n\nTrack Listings\n\n\n1.
