It also shows in great detail the reasons and explains how and why it was possible for those events to happen. You would probably think that Hitler didn't have anything to do with creation of Israel but a closer examination clearly shows that the very Nazi policies which started the persecution of Jews enabled the State of Israel to be formed in the first way and later consolidated it with the Holocaust trauma which is still today the basestone of its policies. Some uninformed defenders of the Holocaust tale declare that if the Jews hadn't been forced or taken against their will from their homes and lifestyles, none of this would have never happened even if it were just the unfortunate death of hundreds of thousands by starvation and typhus. Very few understand that there were actually two entities that wanted the German, later European Jews, to emigrate out of Germany and Europe - the German Nazis and... the Zionists. The World Zionist Organization and the American Jewish Council were adamant that Jews emigrate nowhere else than Palestine. The Germans had tried to arrange emigration to Madagascar and Uganda but those possibilities were closed by Jewish organizations. What remained is a working relationship with the Zionist organizations Irgun and Haganah to facilitate emigration to Palestine. The cooperation which existed between Heydrich's Gestapo and the Jewish self-defense league in Palestine, the Haganah, would not have been closer if it was not for Eichmann who made it public. The commander of Haganah was Feivel Polkes, born Poland, with whom in February 1937, the SD troop leader Adolf Eichmann met in Berlin. These two Jews made a brotherly agreement. Polkes the underground fighter got in writing this assurance from Eichman: 'A body representing Jews in Germany will exert pressure on those leaving Germany to emigrate only to Palestine. Such a policy is in the interest of Germany and will be executed by the Gestapo.' Adolf Hitler - Founder of Israel is controversial from beginning to end, and despite its seemingly offensive title, shows undoubtly that a secret cooperation existed between the elites of both Nazis and Zionists to push the Jews into Palestine although everyone knew that this would stir up the ancient conflict with Arabs - or was this exactly what they wanted? Many wonder why World War II has never ended but still more than 50 years later rages on in the Middle East and elsewhere. And most importantly, why in the process so many millions have perished and continue to perish. In other words, why ever since its inception thousands of years ago Israel has been in war with Jews and the rest of humanity. This book is a highly recommended reading for all the Jews and non-Jews alike. 165 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone. From the back cover: On the front cover are seen two criss-crossed runic letters &quot;Eihwaz&quot; symbolizing Yews surrounded by some secret inscription, which as trees have the property of immortality. In the Teutonic and Viking lore they had to ease Life's transition to the god Hel, ruler of the Land of Death. There Humans would confront their deepest fears and rebirth with a new Wisdom, which cannot be taught but must be experienced. The Yews were used as an emblem of the secret Israeli &quot;Thule Society&quot;, to which Adolf Hitler belonged. As any seeker of the truth (hidden in the Divine Runes) must surmount obstacles in order to reveal it, so it was the case with the author, for whom the postscript would have helped to remove. The postscript also benefits the reader who soon will view the whole truth in a movie, and in effect, from the world of illusions enter the world of reality. And - Why? For an answer to this question look into this book.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca53e3787de46da384da56ffd4b5f73bcde2767f","amp;dn":"Adolf+Hitler%3A+Founder+of+Israel+-+Kardel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca53e3787de46da384da56ffd4b5f73bcde2767f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,83,227,120,125,228,109,163,132,218,86,255,212,181,247,59,205,226,118,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
