It's the only current, comprehensive guide to working with cabochons--a flat piece of rock or mineral--and it covers all the basics, along with a range of new creative techniques and hot trends. \n\nFind out which tools and materials to use, which beads work best, and how to wrap them round the stones. Craft turned, pointed, twisted, brick stitch, ruffled, or scalloped edges, or add decorative fringe. For something dramatic, combine more than one cabochon in a single piece. \n\nOr, instead of natural stone, use dichroic glass or other found objects. Make a glittering brooch, funky bracelets, a wearable art necklace, and other showstoppers.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction, Beadwork |by Jamie Cloud Eakin|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971d90eb9c6e1a1d4521d61e9ca9942371e3af00","amp;dn":"Beading+with+Cabochons%3A+Simple+Techniques+for+Beautiful+Jewelry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971d90eb9c6e1a1d4521d61e9ca9942371e3af00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,29,144,235,156,110,26,29,69,33,214,30,156,169,148,35,113,227,175,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
