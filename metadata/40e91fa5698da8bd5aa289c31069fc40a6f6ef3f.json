Inside is a letter from a man called Garrett.\n\nMy dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together...\n\nFor Garrett, his message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? What is their story? Challenged by the mystery and unaccountably drawn to find him, Theresa embarks on a search that takes her to a sunlit coast town and an unexpected confrontation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40e91fa5698da8bd5aa289c31069fc40a6f6ef3f","amp;dn":"Nicholas+Sparks+-+Message+in+a+Bottle+-+Read+by+Kimberly+Schraf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40e91fa5698da8bd5aa289c31069fc40a6f6ef3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,233,31,165,105,141,168,189,90,162,137,195,16,105,252,64,166,246,239,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
