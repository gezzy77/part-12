The biggest and oldest statue in a land of colossal ancient monuments, its scale is staggering: The mighty head towers as tall as the White House, while its body is nearly the length of a football field.\n\nThis strange half-human, half-lion image has inspired countless fantastic theories about its origins. How was it built, and who or what does it represent? Surprisingly, the scribes of the period when it was builtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½during Egypt's Old KingdomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½passed over it in silence. Adding to the mystery, archeologists found that its creators abruptly discarded their tools and abandoned the Sphinx when it was nearly complete.\n\nSearching for clues, NOVA's expert team of archeologists, including Mark Lehner (director, Ancient Egypt Research Associates), carries out eye-opening experiments that reveal the techniques and incredible labor that was invested in the carving of this gigantic sculpture. The team also unearths new discoveries about the people who built the Sphinx and why they created such a haunting and stupendous image.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 466 MiB for 56mn 36s 984ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Nature/Science\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 000 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 336 (1.857) at 23.976 fps\n\nudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 137 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6d80d82cee0f63d6c38e1c2920cba36bae7db1","amp;dn":"PBS.Nova-Riddles+of+the+Sphinx.S37E11.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6d80d82cee0f63d6c38e1c2920cba36bae7db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,109,128,216,44,238,15,99,214,195,142,28,41,32,203,163,107,174,125,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
