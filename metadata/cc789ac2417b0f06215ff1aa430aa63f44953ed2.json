But Gretchen MÃƒÂ¼ller, who grew up in the National Socialist Party under the wing of her &quot;uncle&quot; Dolf, has been shielded from that side of society ever since her father traded his life for Dolf's, and Gretchen is his favorite, his pet.\n\nUncle Dolf is none other than Adolf Hitler.\n\nAnd Gretchen follows his every command.\n\nUntil she meets a fearless and handsome young Jewish reporter named Daniel Cohen. Gretchen should despise Daniel, yet she can't stop herself from listening to his story: that her father, the adored Nazi martyr, was actually murdered by an unknown comrade. She also can't help the fierce attraction brewing between them, despite everything she's been taught to believe about Jews.\n\nAs Gretchen investigates the very people she's always considered friends, she must decide where her loyalties lie. Will she choose the safety of her former life as a Nazi darling, or will she dare to dig up the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it could get her and Daniel killed?\n\nFrom debut author Anne Blankman comes this harrowing and evocative story about an ordinary girl faced with the extraordinary decision to give up everything she's ever believed . . . and to trust her own heart instead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc789ac2417b0f06215ff1aa430aa63f44953ed2","amp;dn":"Prisoner+of+Night+and+Fog+-+Anne+Blankman+-+%5BAdvance+Reader%27s+E-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc789ac2417b0f06215ff1aa430aa63f44953ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,120,154,194,65,123,15,6,33,95,241,170,67,10,166,63,68,149,62,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
