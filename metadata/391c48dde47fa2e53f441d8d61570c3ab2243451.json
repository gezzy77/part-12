No brokerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fee.\n\nSusan and Alex Wendt have found their dream apartment.\n\nSure, the landlady is a little eccentric. And the elderly handyman drops some cryptic remarks about the basement. But the rent is so low, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too good to pass up.\n\nBig mistake. Susan soon discovers that her new home is crawling with bedbugs . . . or is it? She awakens every morning with fresh bites, but neither Alex nor their daughter Emma has a single welt. An exterminator searches the property and turns up nothing. The landlady insists her building is clean. Susan fears sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going madÃ¢â‚¬â€until a more sinister explanation presents itself: she may literally be confronting the bedbug problem from Hell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:391c48dde47fa2e53f441d8d61570c3ab2243451","amp;dn":"Bedbugs+by+Ben+H.+Winters+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"391c48dde47fa2e53f441d8d61570c3ab2243451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,28,72,221,228,127,162,229,63,68,29,141,97,87,12,58,178,36,52,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
