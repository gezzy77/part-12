In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have been depleted, and as an off-world prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. These can be refined and shipped back to Earth in return for cash, or crafted into new components to augment your fleet. The rarest resources unlock the best equipment, so expand your territory and capture enemy bases, to secure your position on each planet.\r\n\r\nBuild crazy vehicles out of modular blocks! Hunt down enemies, shoot parts off them and scavenge the remains, to make your vehicle harder, better, stronger and faster.\r\n\r\nBuild anything you can imagine! Heavy battle tanks? Yes. Fast scout vehicles? Indeed. Flying carpet bombers? Why not?! Simply drag and snap new blocks onto your creation, and get straight back into the fray!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49aee95d4d1737fec14e8437b58f9fe223a59462","amp;dn":"TerraTech+v0.5.19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49aee95d4d1737fec14e8437b58f9fe223a59462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,174,233,93,77,23,55,254,193,78,132,55,181,143,159,226,35,165,148,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
