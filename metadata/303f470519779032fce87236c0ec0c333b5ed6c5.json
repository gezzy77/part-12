However, science as we know it now, is not just a collection of bits of knowledge. On the other hand, it refers to a systematic way of building u p, organizing, and handling knowledge in the form of testa ble explanations and predictions.\n'Why?' is the basic question that led to the great enquiries of science. Early Man wondered a bo ut everything he saw a round him. The rising sun, the thundering storm clouds, the twinkling stars - all these brought countless questions into his mind, and science came to be. Great scientific minds put together related facts, drew up general principles, and thus paved the way for scientific thinking.\nIt would obviously be im possible to carry all the epoch-making feats of science in a single issue of Tell Me Why. In this issue, are included some questions related to physics, chemistry, biology and geology. Questions related to mathematics - the queen of all sciences- will be published in a later issue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303f470519779032fce87236c0ec0c333b5ed6c5","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Science+%28Tell+Me+why+%2372%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303f470519779032fce87236c0ec0c333b5ed6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,63,71,5,25,119,144,50,252,232,114,54,192,236,12,51,59,94,214,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
