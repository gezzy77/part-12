The book shattered journalistic and literary conventions. Critic Lionel Trilling called it the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most realistic and most important moral effort of our American generation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nThe origins of Agee and Evan's famous collaboration date back to an assignment for Fortune magazine, which sent them to Alabama in the summer of 1936 to report a story that was never published. Some have assumed that Fortune's editors shelved the story because of the unconventional style that marked Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, and for years the original report was lost.\n\nBut fifty years after AgeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, a trove of his manuscripts turned out to include a typescript labeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cotton Tenants.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Once examined, the pages made it clear that Agee had in fact written a masterly, 30,000-word report for Fortune.\n\nPublished here for the first time, and accompanied by thirty of Walker EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic photos, Cotton Tenants is an eloquent report of three families struggling through desperate times. Indeed, AgeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dispatch remains relevant as one of the most honest explorations of poverty in America ever attempted and as a foundational document of long-form reporting. As the novelist Adam Haslett writes in an introduction, it is Ã¢â‚¬Å“a poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brief for the prosecution of economic and social injustice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355f1c4333cbd444e8878c0e9e9c1f4ad6250b8c","amp;dn":"Cotton+Tenants+-+Three+Families+%281936+Essay+by+James+Agee+with+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355f1c4333cbd444e8878c0e9e9c1f4ad6250b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,95,28,67,51,203,212,68,232,135,140,14,158,156,31,74,214,37,11,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
