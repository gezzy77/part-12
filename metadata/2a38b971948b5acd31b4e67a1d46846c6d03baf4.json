I'll release a new\nversion of this application every time a new emulator\ncomes out so stay tuned! And saving your game at the\nbeginning of a new mission before closing the game\nshould work just fine until then. Happy Seeding!\n\n- I start the game with 1821 GDI Experience Points.\n\nThis is caused by a bug in the &quot;persona_text.xml&quot; file\nincluded in this torrent. Browse to the file &quot;Offline\nPatch &gt; Resources &gt; Docs&quot;, open it using Notepad and\nchange &quot;&lt;GDIExp&gt;1821&lt;/GDIExp&gt;&quot; to &quot;&lt;GDIExp&gt;0&lt;/GDIExp&gt;&quot;\n\n\nClarifications:\n---------------\n\nIt's normal that you will NOT gain any experience points \nfrom the first few missions since they are nothing but a \nshort tutorial. This is not a bug!\n\nYou can run the Offline Patch and the Custom Launcher\nfrom ANY location you like. They don't have to be in the\nCommand &amp; Conquer 4 game directory.\n\n\nCredits:\n--------\n\nDeveloped and brought to you by Blacktronic ~\nBased on an emulator by KoriTama ~\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nNEWER VERSION RELEASED!\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5458657\n-----------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a38b971948b5acd31b4e67a1d46846c6d03baf4","amp;dn":"Command+%26+Conquer+4+Crack+%7C+Automated+Patch+%2B+One+Click+Launcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a38b971948b5acd31b4e67a1d46846c6d03baf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,56,185,113,148,139,90,205,49,180,230,122,29,70,132,108,109,3,186,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
