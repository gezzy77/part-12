One OCRed, one not.\n\nPreserving Food without Freezing or Canning: Traditional Techniques Using Salt, Oil, Sugar, Alcohol, Vinegar, Drying, Cold Storage, and Lactic Fermentation\n\nTypical books about preserving garden produce nearly always assume that modern &quot;kitchen gardeners&quot; will boil or freeze their vegetables and fruits. Yet here is a book that goes back to the futureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½celebrating traditional but little-known French techniques for storing and preserving edibles in ways that maximize flavor and nutrition.\n\nTranslated into English, and with a new foreword by Deborah Madison, this book deliberately ignores freezing and high-temperature canning in favor of methods that are superior because they are less costly and more energy-efficient.\n\nAs Eliot Coleman says in his foreword to the first edition, &quot;Food preservation techniques can be divided into two categories: the modern scientific methods that remove the life from food, and the natural 'poetic' methods that maintain or enhance the life in food. The poetic techniques produce... foods that have been celebrated for centuries and are considered gourmet delights today.&quot;\n\nPreserving Food Without Freezing or Canning offers more than 250 easy and enjoyable recipes featuring locally grown and minimally refined ingredients. It is an essential guide for those who seek healthy food for a healthy world.\nAbout the Author\nCentre Terre Vivante is an ecological research and education center located in Mens, Domaine de Raud, a region of southeastern France.
