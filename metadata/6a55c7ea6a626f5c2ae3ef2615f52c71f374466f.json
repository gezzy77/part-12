Although supporters claim that open access is pro-competitive, the opposite is true. Forced access policies inevitably mean price and quality controls, stagnation, increased litigation, and a crippling of innovation.\n\nGenuine competition requires that firms have the ability to exclude rivals. Government seizure of existing networks and technologies on behalf of rivals means that next-generation technologies will not be created by those rivals or the incumbents. The recent decision by the FCC to continue such micro-management of local telecom markets illustrates this principle; regulators have opted to continue to require sharing of local telephone lines and switches despite the fact that those rules have decimated innovation and investment in the U.S. telecom market.\n\nThe key message for policymakers hoping for a high-tech renaissance: Competition in the creation of networks is as important as competition in the goods and services that get sold across those networks. Competition, innovation, and consumers will suffer if forced sharing policies are not abandoned. In today's world of increasing global communications and digital technologies, What's Yours Is Mine makes an urgently needed pro-consumer case for laissez-faire in the evolution of technology industries.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nAdam Thierer is director of Telecommunications Studies and Wayne Crews director of Technology Studies at the Cato Institute. They are also the editors of the recent Cato book, Copy Fights: The Future of Intellectual Property in the Information Age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a55c7ea6a626f5c2ae3ef2615f52c71f374466f","amp;dn":"What%27s+Yours+Is+Mine+-+Adam+Thierer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a55c7ea6a626f5c2ae3ef2615f52c71f374466f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,85,199,234,106,98,111,92,42,227,239,38,21,245,44,113,243,116,70,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
