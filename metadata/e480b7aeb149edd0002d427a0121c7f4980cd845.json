Each player takes on the role of one of the major nations of the era, controlling diplomacy, economy, warfare, exploration, and colonization. The game takes place on a map divided into approximately 1,500 provinces, and proceeds in a pausable real time format.\n\n\n\n   - A number of unique features ensure historical accuracy, including period monarchs, military leaders, and technological gains.\n\n   - Involve yourself in colonization, exploration, trade and infrastructure, war, religion, and diplomacy against other players or your computer.\n\n   - Ninety different nations are potentially player-controlled, while the powerful AI controls nonplayer nations.\n\n   - Choose from nine scenarios, including a Grand Campaign game that encompasses 300 years.\n\n   - There are more than 500 different historical missions and a dynamic system that generates countless exciting missions.\n\n   - More than 200 historical events potentially affect the outcome of your actions. A map covering the entire globe encompasses 800-plus named provinces, 550-plus named sea zones, and 100-plus named rivers.\n\n   - The real-time game can be set to pause at any time or any given event to give players time to plan ahead, thereby creating a semi-real-time environment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e480b7aeb149edd0002d427a0121c7f4980cd845","amp;dn":"Europa+Universalis+%28GOG+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e480b7aeb149edd0002d427a0121c7f4980cd845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,128,183,174,177,73,237,208,0,45,66,122,1,33,199,244,152,12,216,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
