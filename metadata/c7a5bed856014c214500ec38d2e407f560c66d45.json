Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do Samurai II justice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second.\n\nBut looks alone wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t carry a game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new \nexperience for hack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ slash gamers on the go.\n\nSamurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he \nget his Vengeance?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a5bed856014c214500ec38d2e407f560c66d45","amp;dn":"Samurai+II%3A+Vengeance+THD+Version.+1.0+For+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a5bed856014c214500ec38d2e407f560c66d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,165,190,216,86,1,76,33,69,0,236,56,210,228,7,245,96,198,109,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
