With drummer extraordinaire Max Roach and either Ray Brown or Curly Russell on bass, Powell clearly revels in the spotlight, with his astoundingly deft and emotive playing showcased on both thrilling upbeat numbers (&quot;Tempus Fugue-It&quot;) and wistful downbeat tunes (&quot;I'll Keep Loving You&quot;).
