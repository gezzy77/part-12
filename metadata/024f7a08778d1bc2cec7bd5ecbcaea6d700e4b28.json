They were not nice boys; nice boys don't play rock &amp; roll. They were ugly, misogynistic, and violent; they were also funny, vulnerable, and occasionally sensitive, as their breakthrough hit, &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine,&quot; showed. While Slash and Izzy Stradlin ferociously spit out dueling guitar riffs worthy of Aerosmith or the Stones, Axl Rose screeched out his tales of sex, drugs, and apathy in the big city. Meanwhile, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler were a limber rhythm section who kept the music loose and powerful. Guns N' Roses' music was basic and gritty, with a solid hard, bluesy base; they were dark, sleazy, dirty, and honest -- everything that good hard rock and heavy metal should be. There was something refreshing about a band that could provoke everything from devotion to hatred, especially since both sides were equally right. There hadn't been a hard rock band this raw or talented in years, and they were given added weight by Rose's primal rage, the sound of confused, frustrated white trash vying for his piece of the pie. As the '80s became the '90s, there simply wasn't a more interesting band around, but owing to intra-band friction and the emergence of alternative rock, Rose's supporting cast gradually disintegrated, as he spent years in seclusion. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Welcome To The Jungle\n02.Sweet Child O' Mine\n03.Paradise City\n04.Patience\n05.You Could Be Mine\n06.Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n07.Perfect Crime\n08.Don't Cry\n09.Civil War\n10.November Rain\n11.Live And Let Die\n12.Ain't It Fun\n13.Since I Don't Have You\n14.Street Of Dreams\n15.Chinese Democracy\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.It's So Easy\n02.Nightrain\n03.Mr. Brownstone\n04.You're Crazy\n05.Move To The City\n06.Yesterdays\n07.Dead Horse\n08.Dust N' Bones\n09.Estranged\n10.Garden Of Eden\n11.Right Next Door To Hell\n12.The Garden\n13.Hair Of The Dog\n14.You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory\n15.Sympathy For The Devil\n16.Catcher In The Rye\n17.Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n   \n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024f7a08778d1bc2cec7bd5ecbcaea6d700e4b28","amp;dn":"Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%5B2010%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024f7a08778d1bc2cec7bd5ecbcaea6d700e4b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,79,122,8,119,141,27,194,206,199,189,94,203,202,234,109,112,14,75,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
