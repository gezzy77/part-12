The lineup of Chick Corea, Al Di Meola, Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White is close to what I would put together in a band that would be closest to perfection. This albumn is so varied: elements include some pure jazz, pure classical, flights of whimsy(the Sorcerer and the Magician), and elements of stylistic audacity coupled with a mastery of guitar and bass(especially in the Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant), along with the elegaic themes of Majestic Dance. Al Di Meola shines in this albumn, and his performances here I believe established him as one of the premier guitarists in jazz/ fusion. Chick Corea is always magnificent, and here, he shows his magnificence as a leader, who allows his band members flower to their full brilliance. Stanley Clarke is impeccable as always, as is Lenny White, of who's like, today, are rare. \n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
