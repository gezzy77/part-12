It comes, most likely, from the Three Deuces on New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSwing Alley,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 52nd Street.\nThe supporting cast of trumpeter Miles Davis, pianist Duke Jordan, bassist Tommy Potter, and drummer Max Roach helped compromise the Charlie quintet but Jordan is heard in solo only briefly and Davis hardly at all. Tape was precious and Knepper saved the lionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s share for Bird.
