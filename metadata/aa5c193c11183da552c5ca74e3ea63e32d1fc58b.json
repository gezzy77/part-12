Using AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Core Audio, you can leverage all that power in your own Mac and iOS software, implementing features ranging from audio capture to real-time effects, MP3 playback to virtual instruments, web radio to VoIP support. The most sophisticated audio programming system ever created, Core Audio is not simple. In Learning Core Audio, top Mac programming author Chris Adamson and legendary Core Audio expert Kevin Avila fully explain this challenging framework, enabling experienced Mac or iOS programmers to make the most of it. In plain language, Adamson and Avila explain what Core Audio can do, how it works, and how it builds on the natural phenomena of sound and the human language of audio. Next, using crystal-clear code examples, they guide you through recording, playback, format conversion, Audio Units, 3D audio MIDI connectivity, and overcoming unique challenges of Core Audio programming for iOS. Coverage includes: mastering Core AudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising style and conventions; recording and playback with Audio Queue; synthesizing audio; perform effects on audio streams; capturing from the mic; mixing multiple streams; managing file streams; converting formats; creating 3D positional audio; using Core MIDI on the Mac; leveraging your Cocoa and Objective-C expertise in Core AudioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s C-based environment, and much more. When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve mastered the Ã¢â‚¬Å“black artsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Core Audio, you can do some serious magic. This book will transform you from an acolyte into a true Core Audio wizard.\n\n\n# Paperback: 336 pages\n# Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 1 edition (April 9, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321636848\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321636843","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5c193c11183da552c5ca74e3ea63e32d1fc58b","amp;dn":"Learning+Core+Audio+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5c193c11183da552c5ca74e3ea63e32d1fc58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,92,25,60,17,24,61,165,82,197,202,116,227,234,99,227,45,31,197,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
