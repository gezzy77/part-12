Known for their offbeat sense of humor (all band members adopted the surname &quot;Dwarf&quot;), they were nominated for two Juno Awards during their career. Though not British, they were sometimes compared to NWOBHM acts such as Iron Maiden and Saxon.\r\n\r\nt would be three years before the follow-up was released; due in part to Bryce and Ange leaving the band. They both left the band in 1984 to be replaced by Mike â€œDwarfâ€ Hall and Bad Ronbo â€œDwarfâ€ Mayer. The band soon cut the iconic and now highly sought-after album STAND TALL in '86 on Maze/A&amp;M Records in Canada, and Grudge Records stateside. The KiLLeR DWaRFs toured relentlessly in support of it. The first single, &quot;Keep the Spirit Alive,&quot; was an anthem of the times. Much Musicâ€™s new Pepsi Power Hour provided substantial airplay for their hits &quot;Stand Tall &quot; and â€œKeep The Spirit Aliveâ€ in Canada, while MTV provided great American exposure for the band. MTV soon put the band's videos for &quot;Keep The Spirit Alive&quot; and &quot;Stand Tall&quot; on a 13-week rotation allowing the album to sell an unprecedented 80,000 copies during that time. (It has now surpassed the 100000 units sold and has sold on EBay for as much as $500!) By the spring of 1987, the video became the most requested video on MTV, setting a record that would take years to overcome. It still holds the record for MTV's most-requested independent video of all time. A second video Stand Tall was greeted with similar accolades. The exposure led to Russ hosting the MTV &quot;Head bangerâ€™s Ball&quot; with Rob Halford of Judas Priest in 1987.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of national tours of the United States and Canada the exposure got the KiLLeR DWaRFs noticed and brought Sony/Epic Records to their door offering a multimillion-dollar worldwide recording contract. The KiLLeR DWaRFs first album with Sony/Epic was BIG DEAL. It was recorded again in Toronto and produced by Simon Halhart, whose previous credits included the likes of Saxon and Marillion, Big Deal continued on the road the band had paved for itself. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 The KiLLeR DWaRFs are also set to release a â€œlostâ€ never before released KiLLeR DWaRFs album entitled Start @ One in 2013. It was recorded back in 1993 with the same line up as Method to the Madness. The Album will also include two brand new tracks. \r\nThe full band will perform on the Monsters Of Rock Cruise 2014. They are also set to appear at Rocklahoma, 80's in the Park, and Skullfest In 2014. \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nAlbums\r\n\r\nAll are mp3 320ak  \r\n\t\r\n1983 - Killer Dwarfs\r\n  \t\r\n1986- Stand Tall\r\n  \t\r\n1988 - Big Deal\r\n  \t\r\n1990 - Dirty Weapons\r\n  \t\r\n1992 - Method to the Madness\r\n  \t\r\n2002 - Reunion of Scribes Live 2001 (live)\r\n  \t\r\n2013 - Start @ One\r\n\r\n\r\nFor individual track titles click on files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3091b5739511785b181ac7afdbd73b0ea02d8fb0","amp;dn":"Killer+Dwarfs+Discography+1983+-+2013++320+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3091b5739511785b181ac7afdbd73b0ea02d8fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,145,181,115,149,17,120,91,24,26,199,175,219,215,59,14,160,45,143,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
