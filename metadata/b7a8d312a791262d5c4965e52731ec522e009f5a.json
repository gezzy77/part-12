And especially the persistent rumors that the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth comes from killing people.\n\nJoe Pickett, still officially a game warden but now mostly a troubleshooter for the governor, is assigned to find out what the truth is, but he discovers a lot more than heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d bargained for. There are two other men living up at that ranch. One is a stone-cold killer who takes an instant dislike to Joe. The other is newÃ¢â‚¬â€but Joe knows him all too well. The first man doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t frighten Joe. The second is another story entirely. \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a8d312a791262d5c4965e52731ec522e009f5a","amp;dn":"Stone+Cold+by+C.+J.+Box+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a8d312a791262d5c4965e52731ec522e009f5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,168,211,18,167,145,38,45,92,73,101,229,39,49,236,82,46,0,159,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
