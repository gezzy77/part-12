Mostly oldschool or oldschool influenced. \n\nThis collection&amp;#039;s purpose is to introduce the Electronic Body Music genre to those who aren&amp;#039;t familiar with the style, as well as to spread less known, but good quality EBM bands. Thus it does not include full albums, and only has an introductary purpose. Support the bands and artists if you like them. This is an upgraded version of the collection with more than twice as many bands and songs. \n\nEnjoy, and look out for new versions with more bands updates from time to time. Includes A Split Second, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â ;GRUMH..., Anax Imperator, And One, Bigod 20, Carbon 12, Cat Rapes Dog, Clock DVA, Cobalt 60, Combichrist, Container 90, DAF (Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft), Die Krupps, Dioxyde, Dupont, EkoBrottsMyndigheten, Faderhead, Feindflug, Fixmer/McCarthy, Fragbyte, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Gaytron, Grendel, Hocico, Icon of Coil, Kelly Bailey, Liaisons Dangereuses, Machinesoldier, Militant Cheerleaders On The Move, Nigra Nebula, Nitzer Ebb, Panzer AG, Parzival, PouppÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Fabrikk, Proceed, Robert GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rl, SAUER KREUZ FEUER, Serpents, Siesta Submarina, Skiftende Skydekke, Skinny Puppy, Spetsnaz, Stin Scatzor, Sturm CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Sucide Commando, Synthikat, T.A.N.K, Terence Fixmer, The Neon Judgement, The Normal, Tyske Ludder, Vladimir Harkonnen, Wumpscut, and Yelworc.\n\n\nSEEDING: I am a traveler, thus there will be periods when I can&amp;#039;t seed (i.e. 10 days from now for a week or two) and so on. Thus any seeding help is appreciated! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39864bede8fbf6113f2d48cb2a38891c621ed9fa","amp;dn":"Catchy+EBM+Collection+VA+2+%28%28NEW+VERSION+2%29%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39864bede8fbf6113f2d48cb2a38891c621ed9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,134,75,237,232,251,246,17,63,45,72,203,42,56,137,28,98,30,217,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
