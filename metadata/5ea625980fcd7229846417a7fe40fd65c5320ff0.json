MP3 64 (good enough for audiobooks for me and smaller file size).\nTags- Genre: Audiobook, Contributing Author: Max Brooks, Album: World War Z D#(number of disk 1-10).\nFile names are in order throughout the folders and so are the track #s and titles so one can dump them all in one folder if that works better and rename the album name to just World War Z without the Disk#.\nHope this is helpful and will appreciate any criticism on how to do it better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea625980fcd7229846417a7fe40fd65c5320ff0","amp;dn":"World+War+Z-+tagged+mp3+repack+of+xelaispwn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea625980fcd7229846417a7fe40fd65c5320ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,166,37,152,15,205,114,41,132,100,23,167,254,64,253,101,197,50,15,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
