He was a dominant session saxophone player around New York in the 1950s and 1960s until his violent death. This box set is a fine tribute to the musician. It consists largely of solo recordings by him and significant recordings where he provided stunning solos. Some of these are very well known (e.g. recordings with The Coasters) and a lot are much more obscure stuff. He was just about the most fluid and flexible soloist of that period. The package sounds good and is very well presented. (review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nKing Curtis - Wail Man Wail! - 1952-1961\n(3CD Fantastic Voyage 2012)\n\nCD1 KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rock 1953-1961\n\n 1.
