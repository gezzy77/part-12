Dimitri Mavros \n&gt; \n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; The film takes place on the Greek Island of Spetses\n&gt; where widowed Greek-History Professor Thomas Bradley\n&gt; (Billy Zane) is about to lose his research grant studying\n&gt; ancient love spells. He knows he is close to a major academic\n&gt; breakthrough and desperately wants to continue his research.\n&gt; Thomas is given one last chance to continue his work on a Greek\n&gt; island, at the home of the supportive Oxford don, Professor Coulter\n&gt; Joined by his 12 year-old daughter, Serena (Amber Savva), Thomas\n&gt; departs to the Greece island looking for the inspiration he \n&gt; needs to finish his thesis. Serena knows that what her father\n&gt; needs most of all is to find love again after the loss of his wife.\n&gt; Initially, Serena tries her hand at matchmaking with the local women \n&gt; on the island, who are less than impressed by the awkward and clumsy\n&gt; Thomas. Very much in tune to the ancient spirits herself, Serena meets\n&gt; Nereid (Kelly Brook) a beautiful mermaid. However, menace is present \n&gt; in the form of the evil Captain Mavros (Alki David), an island fisherman\n&gt; intent on killing Nereid and getting his claws on her priceless jewel-\n&gt; encrusted tail. Serena realises that she has finally found the ideal\n&gt; match for her father and employs her father&amp;#039;s ancient Greek love spells\n&gt; to make them fall in love. Eventually Nereid sacrifices her immortality\n&gt; to become a mortal human being, joining Thomas and Serena back in Oxford \n&gt; where Thomas&amp;#039;s thesis is received in triumph.\n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spike.com/video/fishtales-trailer/2888801&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spike.com/video/fishtales-trailer/2888801&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37fa8b964c896d390b316a06b9f88925c6579eeb","amp;dn":"Fishtales.%5B2007%5D.DVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37fa8b964c896d390b316a06b9f88925c6579eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,250,139,150,76,137,109,57,11,49,106,6,185,248,137,37,198,87,158,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
