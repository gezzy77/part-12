Nothing is left out, and it contains everything you need. Yes - to be successful on Udemy you have to be a good teacher and have good content. So if you can do that, I'll show you the rest.&quot;\r\n\r\nHello!\r\n\r\nIf you would like to become a great Udemy instructor and make a real living doing so, you are in the right place. This course will teach you everything you need to make a difference to more students and earn more money than you ever did in the classroom.\r\n\r\nIn this course we will cover everything from course creation, launching your course, course marketing, ongoing student engagement, and proven ways to maximize your teaching revenue.\r\n\r\nIt took me about 3 years to figure out everything presented in this course, but now I have the fastest growing guitar course on Udemy, with over 6000 students in 6 months with over 50 perfect 5 start ratings!\r\n\r\nSince I am intimately aware of the struggles of teaching online, from course creation, budgeting, marketing (I had no experience selling ANYTHING), and just being a great teacher, I wanted to take the time and make a course dedicated to the teachers like me, who aren't internet marketers by trade, who want to be a great teacher online and make a real living doing so.\r\n\r\nNo joke - I knew NOTHING about online teaching, internet marketing, making videos, pricing, etc. when I started. Simply put, you get it wrong until you get it right, and I'm very proud to be able to share what I've learned with you guys.\r\n\r\nIf I can do it - You can do it. Period. It doesn't matter what you are teaching. If you are a good teacher and care about your student's success, I guarantee this course will show you exactly how to reach more students, make more money, and make a bigger impact than you ever thought possible!\r\n\r\nUnlike most courses on how to make money teaching on Udemy, this one is instructed by a former classroom music teacher, not a marketing professional. This is important for 3 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Marketing professionals generally sell courses on marketing - not on other skills - so unless you are trying to be an internet marketer, these courses aren't exactly applicable.\r\n\r\n2. Marketing professionals are not normally teachers by trade, so their courses aren't clearly organized and lessons don't follow a logical order.\r\n\r\n3. Marketing professionals want to sell you more marketing courses, because that's how they make their money, so they are by nature open-ended and much is left out.\r\n\r\nI on the other hand am a teacher, and I make my living teaching real skills - not just how to make money - and I don't offer any other marketing courses.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, I made this course because I have been helping other instructors launch their teaching careers, and I realized that there are so many people that could benefit from what I've learned - it's almost an obligation to share it!\r\n\r\nThe online learning industry is exploding, and the time is now. It's 2015 Baby!\r\n\r\nLastly, I want all of my courses to be as interactive as possible, so if you wish to post videos completing lessons, or have a question about any specific lesson, please post the YouTube link or the question in the discussion forum and I will respond to you ASAP.\r\n\r\nThis is something you won't find on any other course anywhere! I try to check the forums daily.\r\n\r\nAnd remember, you have a no questions asked 30 day money back guarantee. I'm confident you'll see the quality of the course right away, but if you don't love it, that's fine too...just send me a message and tell me how I can improve:)\r\n\r\nAlso, just to make sure you love it, you can preview the course for 5 minutes without purchasing. So take a look around!\r\n\r\nPlease Enroll Today!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael Palmisano\r\nWhat are the requirements?\r\n\r\n    A Strong Skill\r\n    A Desire To Teach\r\n    A Computer, Tablet, Or Smart Phone\r\n\r\nWhat am I going to get from this course?\r\n\r\n    Over 45 lectures and 4 hours of content!\r\n    Create Compelling Courses\r\n    Effectively Market These Courses\r\n    Build A Personal Audience\r\n    Earn A Living Teaching Online\r\n\r\nWhat is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Teachers\r\n    Skilled Professionals\r\n    Passionate Instructors\r\n    Beginner Internet Teachers\r\n\r\nCurriculum","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3538ecc5c94f0cf80ea2aa78ff7dc42048b81a74","amp;dn":"Udemy+The+Udemy+Success+Blueprint+By+Michael+Palmisano+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3538ecc5c94f0cf80ea2aa78ff7dc42048b81a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,56,236,197,201,79,12,248,14,162,170,120,255,125,196,32,72,184,26,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
