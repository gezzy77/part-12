In order to re-activate the radio you must call your local dealer and give them your radios serial number that is printed on it. They will charge you 10 to 50 bucks to give you the code. This software will generate the code for you so you do not have to pay for it. I will upload more code generators for more cars soon. This software will cover: Becker, Clarion, Daewoo, Grundig, Mercedes Alpine 10, Volvo, Blaupunkt, clarion_barcode_code_calc, Ford, Hyundai, and Various. You can post an add in your local paper and offer to un-lock radios.\n\nThis Post has a few more that the first Post did not have. This Post also has DVD Unlocking codes to turn your DVD's Macro Vision off and to make it a region free player.\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e2fe25abd866437346e128200f459728656cc3","amp;dn":"%232+Car+radio+Anti-theft+re-activation+code+generator+Softwares+%23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3e2fe25abd866437346e128200f459728656cc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,226,254,37,171,216,102,67,115,70,225,40,32,15,69,151,40,101,108,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
