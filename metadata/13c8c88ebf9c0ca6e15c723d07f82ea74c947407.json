First published in 1984, The Hidden Game of Baseball ushered in the sabermetric revolution by demonstrating that we were thinking about baseball statsâ€”and thus the game itselfâ€”all wrong. Instead of praising sluggers for gaudy RBI totals or pitchers for wins, Thorn and Palmer argued in favor of more subtle measurements that correlated much more closely to the ultimate goal: winning baseball games.\r\n            The new gospel promulgated by Thorn and Palmer opened the door for a flood of new questions, such as how a ballparkâ€™s layout helps or hinders offense or whether a strikeout really is worse than another kind of out. Taking questions like these seriouslyâ€”and backing up the answers with dataâ€”launched a new era, showing fans, journalists, scouts, executives, and even players themselves a new, better way to look at the game.\r\n            This brand-new edition retains the body of the original, with its rich, accessible analysis rooted in a deep love of baseball, while adding a new introduction by the authors tracing the bookâ€™s influence over the years. A foreword by ESPNâ€™s lead baseball analyst, Keith Law, details The Hidden Gameâ€™s central role in the transformation of baseball coverage and team management and shows how teams continue to reap the benefits of Thorn and Palmerâ€™s insights today. Thirty years after its original publication, The Hidden Game is still bringing the high heatâ€”a true classic of baseball literature","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c8c88ebf9c0ca6e15c723d07f82ea74c947407","amp;dn":"The+Hidden+Game+of+Baseball+-+3rd+Edition+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c8c88ebf9c0ca6e15c723d07f82ea74c947407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,200,200,142,191,156,12,166,225,92,114,61,7,248,46,167,76,148,116,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
