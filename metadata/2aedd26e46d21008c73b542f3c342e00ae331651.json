Even the new one-layer photographic fonts have at least 25 variations available through the use of layer duplication, texture and gradient fills. Use these and all font variations\n\nInstalation:\nI installed the main Juicer App from Collection 10 ISO and then installed all font collections from that app with the mounted images. Everything works perfectly. Tested Win 7 x64.\n\nIt will take some time to upload. Be patient as I will see it through :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aedd26e46d21008c73b542f3c342e00ae331651","amp;dn":"Digital.Juice.Fonts.Collection.01-10.Volumes.001-132.Pack-TSG-SU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aedd26e46d21008c73b542f3c342e00ae331651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,237,210,110,70,210,16,8,199,59,84,47,60,52,46,0,174,51,22,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
