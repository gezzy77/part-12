Brian Wilson's growing creative ambitions later transformed them into a more artistically innovative group that earned critical praise and influenced manylater musicians.\nThe group was initially composed of singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers, Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. This core quintet was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 1988.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThat's Why God Made the Radio is the twenty-ninth studio album by American rock band The Beach Boys, released on June 5, 2012 on Capitol.
