While traveling in the train, she meets the fabric salesman Charles Drouet, who gives her his card. Once in Chicago, she finds a simple job in a shoe factory sewing shoes, but when she injures a finger, she is fired. Unable to find another job, she looks for Charles, and he invites her to have dinner at the Fitzgerald's, the most expensive restaurant of Chicago, where she meets the elegant middle-age manager George Hurstwood. Carrie moves to Charles' apartment and becomes her lover due to the lack of options, and later George falls in love for her. Pressed by his wife and by the owner of the restaurant to forget Carrie, George leaves all his possessions behind and embezzles a fortune from the restaurant, traveling with Carrie to New York expecting to rebuild his life, but the shadows of his past are cruel with him. Meanwhile, Carrie matures and becomes successful in her business. \n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip):\n\nGeneral           : Carrie (1952).mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 050 Kbps\nLength            : 1.74 GiB for 2h 1mn 36s 608ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 540 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044486/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044486/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese\n\nMy rip.\n\nCarrie (William Wyler, 1952)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3db42bb7b50dd516ea0154efa83cb2f82244bf1","amp;dn":"Carrie+%28William+Wyler%2C+1952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3db42bb7b50dd516ea0154efa83cb2f82244bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,219,66,187,123,80,221,81,110,160,21,78,250,131,203,47,130,36,75,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
