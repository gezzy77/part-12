Rypdal's guitar is hauntingly reverbed and distant throughout, though occasionally on &quot;Seasons&quot; he becomes too fond of caterwauling guitar synth. But this is truly an effort of trio fusion, with ineffable pieces like &quot;Den Forste Sne&quot; (&quot;The First Snow&quot;) appearing and melting away without any tangible solos or structure. From the opening cymbal strikes of &quot;Sunrise,&quot; this album is marked by DeJohnette's best drumming on record; his cymbal sound, pushed to the front and recorded with mikes both above and below the cymbal's bell -- &quot;because that's how the drummer hears it&quot; -- is nothing short of revelatory. Vitous' bass steadies Rypdal's flights of fancy, while his subtle electric piano lines float above. These elements combine most powerfully in &quot;Believer,&quot; which builds from atmospheric shimmers of electric piano into a whorl of bass and plaintive guitar set against the dry rasp of resonating cymbals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700af33fb47ea0fb36c205ef546cc5b88c02d2d9","amp;dn":"Terje+Rypdal%2C+Miroslav+Vitous%2C+Jack+DeJohnette+%5B1979%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700af33fb47ea0fb36c205ef546cc5b88c02d2d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,10,243,63,180,126,160,251,54,194,5,239,84,108,197,184,140,2,210,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
