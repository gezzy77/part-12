It is the third installment in The Elder Scrolls \nseries of games. It was released in North America in 2002 for Microsoft Windows \nand the Xbox. Well-received publicly and critically, selling over four million \ncopies[3] and winning more than 60 awards, including Game of the Year, Morrowind \nholds an average review score of 89% from both Metacritic and Game \nRankings. The game spawned two expansion packs for the PC: Tribunal and \nBloodmoon. Both were eventually repackaged into a full set containing all three, \nMorrowind: Game of the Year Edition, which shipped on October 30, 2003 for both \nPC and Xbox.\n\nThe story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of \nMorrowind, which lies in the empire of Tamriel and is far from the more \ncivilized lands to the west and south that typified Daggerfall and Arena. The \ncentral quests concern the deity Dagoth Ur, housed within the volcanic Red \nMountain, who seeks to gain power and break Morrowind free from Imperial \nreign. Morrowind was designed with an open-ended free-form style of gameplay in \nmind, with a lessened emphasis on the game&amp;#039;s main plot. This choice received \nmixed reviews in the gaming press, though such feelings were tempered by \nreviewers&amp;#039; appreciation of Morrowind&amp;#039;s expansive and detailed game world.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n[Includes]\nMorrowind\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)Unrar\n2)Mount or Burn\n3)Install\n4)Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1f763d98973e897ca288ca3d3d8aed369d248c","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+III%3A+Morrowind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1f763d98973e897ca288ca3d3d8aed369d248c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,31,118,61,152,151,62,137,124,162,136,202,61,61,138,237,54,157,36,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
