Enjoy!\nI'll do my best to get episodes posted that the scene misses (last season they did about half, and I filled in the gaps for the other half).\n\n\n--\n\nCapper request:\nIf anyone still has the old caps that used to circulate (capped by DigitalDistractions) of the early seasons, it would be REALLY cool to see those posted.   The early seasons were called &quot;Rick Mercer's Monday Report&quot; before it was re-branded as Rick Mercer Report (and moved to Tuesdays) by season 3. \n\nI am hoping someone out there archived those files... and can get them posted.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35d9bef99de48d21e5f3a8240efdc028069b7c0","amp;dn":"Rick.Mercer.Report.S12E01.2014.10.07.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35d9bef99de48d21e5f3a8240efdc028069b7c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,93,155,239,153,222,72,210,30,95,58,130,64,239,220,2,128,105,183,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
