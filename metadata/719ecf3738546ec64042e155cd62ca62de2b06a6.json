ItÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fulfilling and immensely economical process, one perfectly suited for our timesÃ¢â‚¬â€although, as Jones points out, cooking for one also means we can occasionally indulge ourselves in a favorite treat.\n\nThroughout, Jones is both our instructor and our mentor, suggesting basic recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as tomato sauce, preserved lemons, pesto, and homemade stockÃ¢â‚¬â€that all cooks should have on hand; teaching us how to improvise using an ingenious strategy of building meals through the week; and supplying us with a lifetimeÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of tips and shortcuts. From ChildÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advice for buying fresh meat to BeardÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s challenge to beginning crÃƒÂªpe-makers and Lidia BastianichÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tips for cooking perfectly sauced pasta, JonesÃƒÂ¢?Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book presents a wealth of acquired knowledge from our finest cooks.\n\nThe Pleasures of Cooking for One is a vibrant, wise celebration of food and enjoying our own company from one of our most treasured cooking experts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719ecf3738546ec64042e155cd62ca62de2b06a6","amp;dn":"The+Pleasures+of+Cooking+for+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719ecf3738546ec64042e155cd62ca62de2b06a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,158,207,55,56,84,110,198,64,66,225,85,205,98,202,98,222,43,6,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
