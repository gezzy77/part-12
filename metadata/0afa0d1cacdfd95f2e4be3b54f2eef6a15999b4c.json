He goes beyond what is meant by the legal term and brings it into our homes.\n\nThis is not a lecture on the legalities of &quot;child of the state&quot; but focuses on the term as a whole and what the agenda is in trying to bring this out.\n\n\n-------\n\nWhile this is a supplement to his book &quot;A Manual For Humanity&quot;, I'm quite sure that everyone will find this stuff well worth listening to!
