With this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about many common coding errors that C++ programmers produce, along with rules and strategies you can use to avoid them.\n\nAuthor Vladimir Kushnir shows you how to use his Safe C++ library, based in part on programming practices developed by the C++ community. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll not only find recipes for identifying errors during your programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compilation, runtime, and testing phases, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn a comprehensive approach for making your C++ code safe and bug-free.\nGet recipes for handling ten different error types, including memory leaks and uninitialized variables\n    Discover problems C++ inherited from C, like pointer arithmetic\n    Insert temporary and permanent sanity checks to catch errors at runtime\n    Apply bug prevention techniques, such as using separate classes for each data type\n    Pursue a testing strategy to hunt and fix one bug at a timeÃ¢â‚¬â€before your code goes into production.\n\n\n-------------\nKeep Learning and help us to share the Knowledge across the World.\n-------------\nMore Ebooks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f116c4f2954cf2eeebc55356c6b3e958881741e6","amp;dn":"Safe+C%2B%2B+-+O%27Reilly+%282012%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f116c4f2954cf2eeebc55356c6b3e958881741e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,22,196,242,149,76,242,238,235,197,83,86,198,179,233,88,136,23,65,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
