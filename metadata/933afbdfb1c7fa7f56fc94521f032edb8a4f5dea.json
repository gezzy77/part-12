In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.\n\nHaving adapted the nu metal and rap rock genres to a radio-friendly yet densely-layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. They have also collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup album Collision Course, and many others on Reanimation.\n\n\n[Track List:]\n\n01 - What I've Done\n02 - In The End\n03 - New Divide\n04 - Faint\n05 - Bleed it Out\n06 - Numb\n07 - Somewhere I Belong\n08 - Given Up\n08 - No More Sorrow\n10 - Valentine's Day\n11 - From The Inside\n12 - Papercut\n13 - Crawling\n14 - Nobody's Listening\n15 - Points of Authority (RemiX)\n16 - Numb Encore (ft.
