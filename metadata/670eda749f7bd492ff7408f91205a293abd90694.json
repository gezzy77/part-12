The trouble is, the bottom - if it exists at all - is deeper and more unnatural than anyone suspects . . . except, that is, for London constable and sorcerer's apprentice Peter Grant. With Inspector Nightingale, the last registered wizard in England, tied up in the hunt for the rogue magician known as 'the Faceless Man,' it's up to Peter to plumb the haunted depths of the oldest, largest, and - as of now - deadliest subway system in the world.\n\nAt least he won't be alone. No, the FBI has sent over a crack agent to help. She's young, ambitious, beautiful . . . and a born-again Christian apt to view any magic as the work of the devil. Oh yeah - that's going to go well.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670eda749f7bd492ff7408f91205a293abd90694","amp;dn":"Whispers+Under+Ground+-+Ben+Aaronovitch++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670eda749f7bd492ff7408f91205a293abd90694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,14,218,116,159,123,212,146,255,116,8,249,18,5,162,147,171,217,6,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
