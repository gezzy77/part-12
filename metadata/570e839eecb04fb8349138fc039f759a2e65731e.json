The spare, lean textures, darkly oblique lyrics and suave stage presence were entirely different from the bands who preceded them on the charts and the radio. Now fully remastered in a beautiful deluxe hardbound book with unreleased photos (48 pages in the CD, 28 large pages in the vinyl) and a second disc of bonus tracks, many unreleased, plus demos and B-sides and a DVD.\n\nThe album will be available as a double CD+DVD, double LP+DVD, and digital album with digital booklet. Pre-orders will come with a replica of the band's first item of merchandise, a button with the original Interpol logo.\n\n\nThe Original Album (2002) (Remastered) \n\n1.  Untitled\n2.
