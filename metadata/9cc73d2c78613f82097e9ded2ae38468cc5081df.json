In addition to the track selections from other artists (more on those later) there are two Arctic Monkeys-related exclusives on the disc too: Helders teams up with a couple of mates for a straight-faced cover of 'Dreamer' by Livin' Joy, while at the end of the album Alex Turner shows up, reading the story 'A Choice Of Three'. Helders' picks for his playlist are impressively\ndiverse, starting off with Goblin's 'Connexion' only to continue with Viktor Vaughn's 'Vaudeville Villain' and Yamasuki's J-rock ditty 'Yama Yama'. That's a pretty decent triple whammy. Hip hop transpires to be something of a theme, with contributions from DJ Format, Zeph &amp; Azeem, Mos Def, Luniz ('I Got 5 On It') and Roots Manuva to name but a few. In amongst all those you'll also encounter tracks by The Stooges, Johnny &amp; The Hurricanes, Simian Mobile Disco, The Rapture and even Modeselektor, making for an eclectic though not undiscerning mix.\n\nEnloy!\n\n..:: PPKLP ::..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc73d2c78613f82097e9ded2ae38468cc5081df","amp;dn":"%5BPPKLP%5D+Late+Night+Tales+By+Matt+Helders+From+Arctic+Monkeys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc73d2c78613f82097e9ded2ae38468cc5081df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,199,61,44,120,97,63,130,9,126,157,237,42,227,132,104,204,80,129,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
