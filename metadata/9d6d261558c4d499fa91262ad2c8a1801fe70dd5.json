Now his fortune could be coming to an end. Crawford has reluctantly endorsed The Happy Pappy Show, a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s series with tidbits of CrawfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wisdom and a cartoon-like host that is threatening to kill him. Set against the cultural and political uncertainty of 1990s Los Angeles and written in a cinematic style that provokes the showbiz world of pop psychology, Self-Esteem: A Novel follows a successful self-help guru stuck in a booze-drenched nightmare trying to save his marriage, renew his relationship with his son, end an affair, appease his business partner, and prepare for his last talk show. But salvation seems a small hill to climb while contemplating an ominous tormentor that may or may not exist. His only hope seems to be an emotionally distant professor who downplays his problems and a famous rap artist who credits Crawford with his success. A dark satire as neurotic as its subject, Self-Esteem is an examination of the madness caused by the constant quest for happiness in a consumer culture based on profit rather than results. The novel also ponders what positive influence, if any, the self-esteem movement has on American society, in which self-love and narcissism are sometimes indistinguishable.\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.self-series.com/\nTRAILER:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6d261558c4d499fa91262ad2c8a1801fe70dd5","amp;dn":"Self-Esteem%3A+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6d261558c4d499fa91262ad2c8a1801fe70dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,109,38,21,88,196,212,153,250,145,38,42,210,200,161,128,31,231,13,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
