A faÃƒÂ§ade meant to be normal and hide the scars of her childhood. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a good life for herself, became a lawyer, and is free from the tortured past that haunts her daily. Until he comes along and breaks open the cracks.\nNathan Thorne has a past of his own. On the surface he is loved by all, personable, extroverted; everything Delilah isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Hidden beneath is a dark and tormented man that only Delilah has to power to unveil.\nCrammed in a small office together they see through each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masks, and the draw becomes too much, igniting an explosive relationship.

Despite their efforts, separation becomes impossible, deceptions escalate, and Nathan has trouble coping; teetering on the edge of being overtaken by his past demons.\nWhat secrets does he harbor that could keep him from giving in? What keeps him from healing and moving forward? And Delilah, where does she fit into all this turmoil?\nCan they accept love and deal with all the trials that come their way when secrets are exposed? Or will they fall through the cracks of their pasts and be consumed by all that haunts them?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7196eb65b759770ee2b154b17deb27c591e9d05","amp;dn":"Lynn_K_I_-Breach.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7196eb65b759770ee2b154b17deb27c591e9d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,25,110,182,91,117,151,112,238,43,21,75,23,222,178,124,89,30,157,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
