It's really not that easy, however, as the game features something called, &quot;Get In, Get Up, and Get Out&quot;. Gamers will need to use stealth in order to &quot;get in&quot; to restricted areas, dexterity and agility in order to scale tall objects to &quot;get up&quot;, and the ability to think on your feet as you run from the powers that be in order to &quot;get out&quot;. The city of New Radius is a living character in Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure; it sets the tone and offers the thematic boundaries that oppress Trane from the opening cinematic to the dramatic conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b988a9b4d8386cf2a3ab66ec5b8640ae889b35d","amp;dn":"Marc+Ecko%27s+Getting+Up+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b988a9b4d8386cf2a3ab66ec5b8640ae889b35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,152,138,155,77,131,134,207,42,58,182,110,197,184,100,10,232,137,179,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
