In five lucid, meticulously documented essays, Wright traces the rise and plummet of four regional civilizations--those of Sumer, Rome, Easter Island, and the Maya--and judges that most, perhaps all, of humanity is making and will continue to make mistakes equally disastrous as theirs. He gives general reasons first for not reckoning weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pull back from the brink. Important among them is an anthropological observation. As individuals, we live long lives. We evolve more slowly than we should, given our lack of vision and our aggressive, selfish nature. We seem to lack the collective wisdom and the insight into cause and effect to realize the limits to what Wright calls the &quot;experiment&quot; of civilization. What Wright calls natural &quot;subsidies&quot; underwrite civilizationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ successes. The squandering of those gifts presages inevitable failure, but with careful, canny stewardship, a civilization can manage to muddle through eons. Wright cites EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s submission to the limits set by the NileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual floods and ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s windblown &quot;lump-sum deposit&quot; of topsoil, used for hillside paddies instead of being put to the plough. Wright observes with unrelenting eloquence that our planetary civilization lives precariously, far beyond its means. &quot;Hope drives us to invent new fixes for old messes,&quot; he acknowledges, neither claiming nor wanting to be a prophet. We certainly have the tools for change and remediation; we also know what our ancestors did wrong and what happened to them. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re faced, our author observes, with two choices: either do nothing--what he calls &quot;one of the biggest mistakes&quot;--or try to effect &quot;the transition from short-term to long-term thinking.&quot; His evidence suggests weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re taking the first alternative, which will include a swift, final ride into the dark future on the runaway train of progress. WrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account tempts one to bet on the rats and roaches. --Ted Whittaker\n\nEach time history repeats itself, the cost goes up. The twentieth century?a time of unprecedented progress?has produced a tremendous strain on the very elements that comprise life itself: This raises the key question of the twenty-first century: How much longer can this go on? With wit and erudition, Ronald Wright lays out a-convincing case that history has always provided an answer, whether we care to notice or not. From Neanderthal man to the Sumerians to the Roman Empire, A Short History of Progress dissects the cyclical nature of humanity?s development and demise, the 10,000-year old experiment that we?ve unleashed but have yet to control.\nIt is Wright?s contention that only by understanding and ultimately breaking from the patterns of progress and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age can we avoid the onset of a new Dark Age. Wright illustrates how various cultures throughout history have literally manufactured their own end by producing an overabundance of innovation and stripping bare the very elements that allowed them to initially advance. WrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is brilliant; a fascinating rumination on the hubris at the heart of human development and the pitfalls we still may have time to avoid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a8934e414a368bbab4938a052627bab5bee82f","amp;dn":"History+of+Things+-+03+-+A+Short+History+Of+Progress+-+%5BQwerty80","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a8934e414a368bbab4938a052627bab5bee82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,168,147,78,65,74,54,139,186,180,147,138,5,38,39,186,181,190,232,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
