Following the XYZ project, Page was asked by his Berkshire neighbour, movie director Michael Winner, to record a soundtrack for the film Death Wish II in late August 1981. Death Wish II starred Charles Bronson, and was set around Chicago, which inspired Page to write a blues flavour soundtrack. Page was given a deadline of a few weeks to write and record the album at his home studio The Sol, and travelled on location to Los Angeles with Winner for songwriting themes. The soundtrack features Dave Mattacks from Fairport Convention, former Pretty Things keyboards player Gordon Edwards, and veteran singer Chris Farlowe. Page uses a Roland guitar synthesizer on a number of tracks. Tracks from this album were later reused by Winner for Death Wish III. Page was later asked to compose the soundtrack for Scream for Help (1985), but suggested John Paul Jones to Winner instead. \nIn Japan a vinyl LP was released that featured rare outtakes from the Sol sessions. Death Wish II was released in CD format in 1999.\n\nTrack listing\n&quot;Who&amp;#039;s to Blame&quot; (Page) - 2:41 \n&quot;The Chase&quot; (Page) - 5:48 \n&quot;City Sirens&quot; (Page/Edwards) - 2:01 \n&quot;Jam Sandwich&quot; (Page) - 2:35 \n&quot;Carole&amp;#039;s Theme&quot; (Page) - 2:50 \n&quot;The Release&quot; (Page) - 2:35 \n&quot;Hotel Rats and Photostats&quot; (Page) - 2:40 \n&quot;A Shadow in the City&quot; (Page) - 4:01 \n&quot;Jill&amp;#039;s Theme&quot; (Page) - 4:00 \n&quot;Prelude&quot; (Page) - 2:20 \n&quot;Big Band, Sax and Violence&quot; (Page) - 2:51 \n&quot;Hypnotizing Ways (Oh Mamma)&quot; (Page) - 2:49 \n\nJimmy Page - Electric guitars, producer \nChris Farlowe - Vocals \nGordon Edwards - Keyboards, vocals \nDave Lawson - Keyboards \nDavid Sinclair Whittaker - Keyboards \nDavid Paton - Bass guitar \nDave Mattacks - Drums and percussion \nGLC Philharmonic - Orchestra \n\nThis album is Page&amp;#039;s only solo material to appear on Led Zeppelin&amp;#039;s label Swan Song.
