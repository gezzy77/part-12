Chris Robinson explores the Scottish character and uncovers some amazing facts about the Scots and the words we use to describe ourselves.\n\nIn SCOTTISH WEATHER, Chris Robinson and Eileen Finlayson take a tour of the country to discover how we describe our weather conditions from coast to country and town to city. \n\nIn SCOTTISH PLACE NAMES Maggie Scott takes you around the country from Dumfries to Shetland to explain the meanings of the place names that make up todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scotland. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Tested all four books in both file types out on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) using Aldiko for the epub file, and Kindle for Android for the mobi files. Calibre was used for converting and testing the epub, and Kindle for PC was used to test the mobi files.\n\nFound that the layout in the books that had columns of text was determined by the size of font I used. You may need to do this with the reader you use if you are like me and use a large font size.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nPlease purchase if you enjoyed these books, and it won't break the piggy bank.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e34a45709d8f1ebe5cc014ac98d6a9fea879c505","amp;dn":"Say+it+in+Scots%21+ebooks+by+Scott+%26amp%3B++Robinson+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e34a45709d8f1ebe5cc014ac98d6a9fea879c505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,74,69,112,157,143,30,190,92,192,20,172,152,214,169,254,168,121,197,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
