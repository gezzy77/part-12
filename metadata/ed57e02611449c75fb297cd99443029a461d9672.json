The small size of the baby sweater allows for more time spent learning the new skill with less time just plain knitting. Crafters can work through the sweaters in the order presented or make the basic pattern and jump straight to the technique that they most desire. The book is perfect for knitters who would like to progress from easy to intermediate projectsÃ‚â€”once the baby-sized options have been completed, the sweaters can be made in adult sizes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed57e02611449c75fb297cd99443029a461d9672","amp;dn":"My+First+Cardigan+Workbook+-+Knitting+8+Top+Down+Sweaters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed57e02611449c75fb297cd99443029a461d9672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,87,224,38,17,68,156,117,251,41,124,217,148,67,2,154,70,29,150,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
