Used the best possible audio for each song.\r\nEach of the Stage/SBD sources ran at different Sound/Pitch/Speed. It was \r\nlike putting a jigsaw puzzle together.\r\n\r\nSound: \r\nThis is more of a Restoration than a Remaster, So I decided to try and \r\ngive each source tonal balance and clarity. It seemed the less I did \r\nthe better it sounded. Is it Perfect? NOPE. But its the best I could do. \r\n\r\nRemastering is just a hobby. Download and Enjoy or Pass on it. The \r\nchoice is yours. This version is never meant to be definitive.\r\n\r\nWinston Remasters - 2015\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe last show of the 1971 Japan tour is a tour de force! The energy and \r\nvirtuosity are unbelievable, and Robert's voice is amazing, sustaining all \r\nof his high range notes and going low ... a most commanding vocal performance. \r\n&quot;We spent two weeks in wonderful, glorious Japan which has been incredible. \r\nGreat hotels, great bars, great people and without giving you any bullshit, \r\nthis is our last night in Japan and we're gonna have a good time and I think \r\nyou will!&quot; said Plant during the show. Dazed And Confused is very long and \r\nincludes some great jams in the middle, including Pennies From Heaven! \r\nStairway To Heaven has a great solo from Jimmy, Celebration Day is fast and \r\nfurious and this may be the best acoustic set I have ever heard! That's The \r\nWay, Going To California, and Tangerine all have amazing improvs within them, \r\nespecially from Jones on the mandolin. Friends has its only live premier here \r\ntoo! Moby Dick is inventive and neat and Whole Lotta Love features some obscure \r\nand great references, and Robert is a joy to listen to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0d77bc09b36cb652dde25300cc5c3c87118685","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1971.09.29+Osaka%2C+Japan+%28Remaster%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0d77bc09b36cb652dde25300cc5c3c87118685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,13,119,188,9,179,108,182,82,221,226,83,0,204,92,60,135,17,134,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
