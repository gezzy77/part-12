For non-important items, freeware is fine... but notice\nhow fast the media begins to skip? that's because of the software. \n\n[Format Explanation]\nI prefer NSIS or PAL formats myself, but with applications that require tons of\nrequirements, runtime registrations, runtime .dlls, etc.. it's easier to pack\nwith Xenocode. The reason i hate Xenocode/ThinStall is they use the registry\nfor it's sandbox, and creates directories for runtime files in &quot;XSxS&quot; directory.\n\nWell.. this &quot;hybrid&quot; utilizes the best of both worlds. \n\nIt's been created with Xenocode, but tested thoroughly for all the registry\nentries, files, and directories it leaves behind, and cleaned up with an NSIS\nlauncher... making it truly &quot;stealth&quot;.\n\ni.e.\nPortableAppz has a version posted but it doesn't even work. \nThat's because Nero requires too many dll's and runtime files to be registered,\nand all is different depending on the Operating System.\n\nNot to mention the licensing... \n\n[Final Words]\nI have thoroughly tested on XP, Vista, and Win7, both 32 and 64Bit to find all \nthe registry entries and files left behind. \n\nAnother benefit of packing with Xenofex is it's optimized for USB/Portable Media.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f731e7e1c2d70aef5e07fa83ab7c92a453fea2a","amp;dn":"Nero+10+BurningROM+10.5.10300%3A+Portable+%26+Stealth+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f731e7e1c2d70aef5e07fa83ab7c92a453fea2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,115,30,126,28,45,112,174,245,224,127,168,58,183,201,42,69,63,234,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
