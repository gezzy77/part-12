The truth does not need any laws to protect it, and it does not need secrecy to protect it. The truth does not need evidence destroyed, nor does it need videotapes to be confiscated.\n\nOnly lies need secrecy. \nonly lies need protection from laws. \nOnly lies benefit from:\n\nFear\nsecrecy\nBlackmail \nGossip\nConfiscation of evidence. \n\n\n\nAre the Germans as stupid as they appear?\nIn February 2007 a German court sentenced Zundel to jail for five years. How could the Germans be so stupid as to put an old man in jail at taxpayers expense simply because he disagrees with the official story of the Holocaust? Can't the German people think of a better way to spend their tax money?\n\nHere are some possibilities in regards to Zundel:\n\n* Blackmail:\nPerhaps Zundel is an honest citizen who questioned the Holocaust.\nThe Zionists realized that he was a potential threat, so a few of them pretended to be his friend in order to set him up for blackmail. \n\n* Corruption in the courts:\nPerhaps Zundel is an honest citizen who questioned the Holocaust.\nPerhaps the Jews are getting away with this absurd arrest because the Zionists within the American, Canadian, and German courts system made sure that the only people dealing with Zundel's deportation and trial were Zionists. \n    \n\n* A Crypto-Zionist :\nPerhaps Zundel is secretly working with the Zionists. \nPerhaps he agreed to be put in jail in order to frighten the Gullible Goyim.  \n\n\n\nDon't be frightened by the Holohoax arrests. What are you; a human or a mouse?\n\nTake this issue of blackmail seriously. \nThe Zionists are not going to sit by while people expose their crimes.\nWhen somebody tries to expose the Holocaust, 9/11, or other crimes, they will be contacted by &quot;helpful&quot; people and &quot;concerned citizens&quot;.\nYou should consider all of these people to be possible Zionists. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat happened to Christopher Bollyn &amp; His family? \nThey Disappeared In June 2007.\n\nThere are important lessons to learn from the bizarre behavior of\nthe Bollyn family.\nI suspect that the entire Bollyn family are prisoners.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.erichufschmid.net/TFC/Bollyn-kidnapping-info.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.erichufschmid.net/TFC/Bollyn-kidnapping-info.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n              Eric Hufschmid...
