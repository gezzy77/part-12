The Age of Globalization is an account of the unlikely connections that made up late nineteenth-century politics and culture, and in particular between militant anarchists in Europe and the Americas, and anti-imperialist uprisings in Cuba, China and Japan. Told through the complex intellectual interactions of two great Filipino writers--the political novelist Jose Rizal and the pioneering folklorist Isabelo de los Reyes--The Age of Globalization is a brilliantly original work on how global exchanges shaped the nationalist movements of the time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Enm8upQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Enm8upQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0336d7c12e9edad1640ef8d0642a773b6e12d46c","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Globalization%3A+Anarchists+and+the+Anticolonial+Imagin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0336d7c12e9edad1640ef8d0642a773b6e12d46c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,54,215,193,46,158,218,209,100,14,248,208,100,42,119,59,110,18,212,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
