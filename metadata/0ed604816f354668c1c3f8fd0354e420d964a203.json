The eight-song collection of cover songs and originals feature the vocals of Waylon Jennings backed by his son Shooter Jennings and the .357ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.  \n\nThe inception of Waylon Forever began in 1995 when Waylon asked Shooter to collaborate on an album with him. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been playing my dad the music I was inspired by at the time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Shooter explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhether it was Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, Pink Floyd or Cream he really enjoyed being apart of my musical journey. It was then he suggested we do an album together.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Of the recording process Shooter states, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe was always so creative and inspired by new musical directions and this was my first real album to put together. I buried myself in the studio for weeks constructing the tracks. With 20 or so songs we went into the studio to cut vocals and overdubs. He was so excited for us doing a record together, constantly pushing himself and coming up with new ideas. I was so nervous but he was calm as a gunslinger.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Final recording sessions for the album began in 2006 after Shooter transferred the original tapes to pro tools. Shooter then brought the .357ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s into the studio in Los Angeles to cut tracks to his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals and complete the record. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe tracks I originally made were a little young and messy, but they were still really wild. Now I feel like I been given the chance to take my years of experience and match them to his,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ confesses Shooter. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEither way, we did it and we now have a record that reflects his huge creative drive and the boundlessness of his own artistic mind. Waylon forever!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nWaylon JenningsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ career spanned for more than 40 years.
