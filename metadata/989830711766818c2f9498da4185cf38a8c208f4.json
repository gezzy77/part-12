Fire Within focuses on eight performers, among them Gareth, a temperamental Brit whose sculpted physique features multiple tattoos; Stella, a young African American trapeze artist who's a bit of a diva; Oleg, a 35-year-old Russian circus professional trying to shift his talents to dance; Olga, a Cirque veteran as a contortionist, being given a starring role in this new show. Skillfully edited, Fire Within  follows the performers along the stressful path from auditions to opening. The show gains surprisingly intimate access into their lives, capturing the strength and vulnerability of people whose bodies are their art--and not everyone rises to the challenges they face. The process of making a show like Varekai isn't always pretty or gentle; if an act isn't working--such as when Gareth and his acrobatic partner Ashley have trouble finding their balance for a piece called the Icarian Games--the act will simply be cut, and the performer fired. Fire Within is a remarkable warts-and-all document of frustration and ingenuity. After each episode, you'll eagerly jump to the next one to learn what happens next.\n\nThe last two episodes don't continue the story. They are only a interview episode and a meeting with the cast after one year.\n\nLength: 23 minutes each episode\nSize: 175 MB each episode\nResolution: depending on the compression (mostly around 600 width)\nCodec: XVID\nAudio: 128 kbit MP3 VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989830711766818c2f9498da4185cf38a8c208f4","amp;dn":"Cirque+du+Soleil+-+Fire+Within+%28TV+Series%29+%5BDVD-Rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989830711766818c2f9498da4185cf38a8c208f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,152,48,113,23,102,129,140,47,148,152,218,65,133,207,56,168,194,8,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
