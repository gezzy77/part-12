All of us here \nare entrenched in music. We're cranking tunes all day. We constantly \nargue about things like which Radiohead album is best, whether Michael \nJackson or Prince would win in a fight, the only five albums we would \nhave on a deserted island and who in the office does the best Running Man. \n\nOne thing we all agree on, however, is that our digital music collections \nwere a mess as were our friends'. When we did some testing, we learned \nthat almost everyone had the same problem we did. \nThat's why we created TuneUp. \n  \nWe'll take care of all of this for you automatically. We're also the type \nof people who want all of our cover-art, don't like missing concerts and \nspend hours online looking for YouTube videos, news, and merch from our \nfavorite artists. We've taken care of that too. And there's more to come... \n\nTuneUp is your music collection's new best friend. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tuneupmedia.com&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tuneupmedia.com&quot;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n- Install TuneUp 2.2.7 from the installation file found in the 'Setup' folder\n- After the installation, copy and replace 'TuneUpApp.exe' from the 'Crack' folder to TuneUp's folder\n  (Usually C:\\Program Files\\TuneUpMedia)\n- Launch TuneUp and register an account (no need for valid info)\n- Enjoy!\n\n\n\nHow to fix the 'Serial' and 'Under Maintenance' problem: \nDelete TuneUpApp.exe from the installation folder and run the setup again to repair the installation. \nAfter that, launch TuneUp, register an account (no need for valid info), close TuneUp completely and apply the crack again.\n\n\nHow to fix the 'MSVCR100.dll' error: \nTry installing all Visual C++ Redistributable Packages. \nGoogle 'Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable', 'Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable' and  'Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable'. \nDownload each respective package and install it on your machine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80e9dd800642ec8548f001d5bc61379b0aeafd9","amp;dn":"TuneUp+Media+%28iTunes+Plugin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80e9dd800642ec8548f001d5bc61379b0aeafd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,14,157,216,0,100,46,200,84,143,0,29,91,198,19,121,176,174,175,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
