But the nice thing about it is that its a sparse image, so you can burn and use it without needing a Dual Layer burner or Dual Layer DVD. This image will successfully burn onto a standard DVD using a standard DVD Burner. The only down side is that the only program that can properly burn a sparse image is Mac&amp;#039;s Disk Utility built into the OS. So the only way you can burn this DVD is if you already have a working Mac. Any mac OS 10.1 and up will have the Disk Utility program of which I speak located in the Utilities folder in the Application folder.\n\n- TehKeyMaster -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b73a2a9395ac7397c3a356723f6ab3dc5a1dc6","amp;dn":"Leopard+OS+10.5+Install+DVD+%28sparse+image%29+TehKeyMaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b73a2a9395ac7397c3a356723f6ab3dc5a1dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,183,58,42,147,149,172,115,151,195,163,86,114,63,106,179,220,90,29,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
