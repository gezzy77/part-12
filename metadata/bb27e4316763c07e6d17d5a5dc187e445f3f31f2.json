With Chet Baker, Roland Hanna and Paul Desmond, Hall is perfectly complemented. A master of melody who never wastes notes, the centerpiece for this release is Hall's interpretation of one movement from JoaquÃƒÂ­n Rodrigo's &quot;Guitar Concerto,&quot; arranged by Don Sebesky. New tracks include alternate takes of &quot;You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To&quot; and &quot;Rock Skippin',&quot; plus &quot;Unfinished Business,&quot; an incomplete track that fades following Desmond's solo just as Hall starts to play (This song is actually &quot;La Paloma Azul,&quot; a Mexican folk tune played by Paul Desmond with the Dave Brubeck Quartet about a decade earlier, also known as &quot;The Blue Dove&quot;).
