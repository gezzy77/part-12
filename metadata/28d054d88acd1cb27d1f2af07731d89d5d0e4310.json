The album was recorded in Germany, except for some parts recorded in Brazil, and was produced by the famous Sascha Paeth(HeavenÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Gate, Rapsody).\nRitual had good reviews by the Brazilian press and all around the world, being released in more than 15 countries. The World Ritual Tour lasted for over a year and a half, crossing Brazil and many other countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. More than 150 shows were played, an excellent mark for a debut album tour.\nIn 2003, Shaman had a good position in the specialized media charts, and a great surprise came when Ritual was elected the best (not only heavy metal) album of 2002 by Folha de Sao Paulo (a very well-known and respected Brazilian daily newspaper) readers. The same accomplishment was repeated in 2004. Still in 2004, the band was the opening act for Iron Maiden at the Pacaembu stadium in SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, for an audience of approximately 45.000 people.\nTo celebrate the huge success, the band decided to register a special live show on DVD. The concert was sold out in Credicard Hall, SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo, with fans and friends, filling the stage with special guests like Tobias Sammet, Sascha Paeth, Marcus Viana and George Mouzayek, Andi Deris and Michael Weikath. The release of RituAlive, in CD and DVD, got great reviews and sales too. According to Universal Music of Brasil , RituAlive is the best DVD of the genre released in Brazil, due to the content and the quality.\nIn 2005, with the second studio album practically finished and ready to be released, the name of the band was changed. The band decided to add an &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; to it, so the new name became Shaaman.\nOn the following months, Reason, the second studio release, reached the stores. The album was recorded in Brazil , produced by the very same Sacha Paeth, who stated that &quot;Reason was the rescue of all heaviness, feeling and heavy-metal spirit of the 80s&quot; and that &quot;while Ritual favored the undeniable and exceptional skills of the musicians, Reason opened up space for their hearts and souls&quot;. The music was more organic, and helped to highlight the contrast between heavy guitars, classic keyboards and world music elements.\nAfter the Reason Tour, that lasted one year, some misunderstandings caused the departure of 3 members, and their abandon of the band opened up space to Thiago Bianchi, LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©o Mancini and Fernando Quesada.\nNow, in 2007, these new members, together with Ricardo Confessori, are on the final stages of recording and mixing the new album, that shall hit the stores by the end of June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSHAMAN - Ritual\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: SHAMAN\nAlbum................: Ritual\nGenre................:\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: FhG\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\n\nRipped by............: Grayghost on 12/2/2008\nPosted by............: Grayghost on 12/2/2008\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\nCovers...............: Front Back\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
