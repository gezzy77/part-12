One day an impoverished miner is taken aback when he notes that he is being followed around by some stranger dressed in white. He and his son run away from the haunting vision, and the miner eventually gets sent on a job to a specific village. When he arrives with his son, he discovers that there is only one woman living in the village and suddenly the man in white shows up and murders the miner. His son witnesses the act but is not seen himself. Then the killer pays off the woman to identify the murderer as a union leader, while the victim himself is passed off as a rival union leader -- whom he uncannily resembles. From that point onward, the plot thickens considerably as the two real union leaders start to investigate the tragedy.\n~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide\n\n\n------------not my rip------------\n\n~~~~~~ Pitfall (1962).avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,550,385,152                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:37:19                \nFrame Count:....................................139992             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................656                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................496                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.323                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1900                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.244&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n        \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df4bfc3664591b66b5a142b14b30878813ec114","amp;dn":"Hiroshi+Teshigahara+-+Otoshiana+aka+Pitfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df4bfc3664591b66b5a142b14b30878813ec114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,244,191,195,102,69,145,182,107,90,20,43,20,179,8,120,129,62,193,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
