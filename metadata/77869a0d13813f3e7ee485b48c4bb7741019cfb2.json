They drive vehicles, use machinery, and\nlive in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,\nwith claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full\nscale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a\nbattle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry\npummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other\nin jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a\npower that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a\nfew brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.\nTheir stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...\nTHE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.\n\nProduced by M2Film and The LEGO Group.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img825/3550/6nmn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img825/3550/6nmn.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOn the night of the 100 Year Moon where the Wolves are at their most\nprimitive and through centuries have lost control, Cragger and Crooler\nkidnap G'loona to lure Laval and his friends out on a search mission,\nhoping to cross paths with the wild wolves.\n\nLEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E07.The.Hundred.Year.Moon.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1920x1080 23.976fps\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:22:03\nFile size: 816 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77869a0d13813f3e7ee485b48c4bb7741019cfb2","amp;dn":"LEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E07.1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77869a0d13813f3e7ee485b48c4bb7741019cfb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,134,154,13,19,129,63,62,126,228,133,180,140,75,183,116,16,25,207,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
