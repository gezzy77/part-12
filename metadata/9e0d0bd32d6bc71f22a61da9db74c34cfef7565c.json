Cale (w/Leon Russell) - Live In Session (DVD) \n\nNotorious for his laid back style, JJ Cale is probably most famous for the songs he penned, including &quot;After Midnight&quot; and &quot;Cocaine&quot;, which Eric Clapton made into hits, and &quot;Call Me The Breeze&quot;, later covered by Lynyrd Skynyrd. \nHowever, Cale`s influence wasn`t only in songwriting, but also his unique sense of rhythm and shuffling boogie, which heavily influence performers such as Clapton and Mark Knopfler. \nThis DVD is the most intimate look at JJ Cale ever. Recorded in 1979 at the Paradise Studios in Los Angeles, this rare and unique session, with Leon Russell on keyboards, gives fans the chance to see this unique talent at work in the studio.  \nTrack Listing: T-Bone Shuffle/Ten Easy Lessons/ Lou-Easy-Ann/Roll On/Fate of a Fool/T-Bone Shuffle/Don Cry Sister/Nowhere to Run/Sensitive Kind/Going Down/No Sweat/Boilin Pot/T-Bone Backwards/Set Your Soul Free/Cocaine/Hands Off Her/Corine Corina/Crazy Mama/After Midnight/Same Ole Blues\n\n\nhttp://img518.imageshack.us/img518/6532/jjcalefront6mb.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0d0bd32d6bc71f22a61da9db74c34cfef7565c","amp;dn":"JJ.CALE.recorded.live.1979.Los.Angeles.XVID.AC3.6ch.448kbps.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0d0bd32d6bc71f22a61da9db74c34cfef7565c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,13,11,211,45,107,199,31,34,166,29,169,219,116,195,76,254,247,86,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
