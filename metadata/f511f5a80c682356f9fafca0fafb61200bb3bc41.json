His singing is serviceable, helped by wife Lucille Spann on two cuts.  Country Joe &amp; the Fish co-founder Barry Melton plays lead guitar, with Luther &quot;Guitar Junior&quot; Johnson taking the second chair. ~ Mark Allan, AMG\n\nI just finished reading the reviews of the other Otis Spann albums on Amazon and was suprised to see this album wasn't even reviewed! This is one of his best- yes, some of sound quality on the earlier records is poor, and yes, the small group (solo or duo) stuff highlights his piano, but this album is *way* better than &quot;walking the blues&quot; and just as good as &quot;is the blues&quot;, if not better. I've had this on vinyl for years and just picked it p on CD. The group is tight, the piano is in the spotlight, there is a serious groove goin' on, and his wife Lucille is absolutly great on &quot;some day&quot; and &quot;blind man&quot; (&quot;blind man&quot; is exceptional). This is also my favorite version of &quot;another mule is kickin' in your stall&quot; - yes, even better than muddy's on &quot;live at Mr. kelly's&quot;.
