Since its first publication in 1981, With the \n\nOld Breed has been recognized as one of the best first-hand accounts of \n\ncombat in the Pacific during World War II. The memoir is based on notes \n\nSledge kept tucked away in a pocket-sized Bible he carried with him during \n\nbattles.\n\n\nI dl this torrent from Demonoid and upped it here, since I couldnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t find it \n\nhere when searching for it.  \n\nAll of you that have seen The Pacifiic (The series) recently might enjoy this \n\nbook extra much, it is written by Eugene Sledge based upon the \n\n&quot;memoirs/notes&quot; he wrote at Peleliu, Okinawa, etc.\n\nThis is some heavy shit, very unlike todays soldiers leaning on much \n\ntechnology to get the job done. Remember as much as 1/3 of their frind were \n\nkilled on some battles so I canÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t help thinking this was written with a lot \n\nom motions, witch in my eyes just made it better.\n\nHappy reading folks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c59430596a56ab97a730b4a70233c03fe0415cc","amp;dn":"Eugene+Sledge+-+With+the+Old+Breed+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c59430596a56ab97a730b4a70233c03fe0415cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,89,67,5,150,165,106,185,122,115,11,74,112,35,60,3,254,4,21,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
