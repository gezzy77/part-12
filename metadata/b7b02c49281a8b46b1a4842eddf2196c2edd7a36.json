The single proved to be the group's second consecutive US top ten hit from The Wedding Album. It was also popular in the UK and other international markets.\n\n \n                                  Music video\n\n   The &quot;Come Undone&quot; video was directed by Julien Temple. Shots of the band were filmed in the London Aquarium; these were interspersed with short vignettes of people &quot;coming undone&quot; in various ways. These vignettes include a little girl seeing her parents together, an older couple who have survived a flood, an alcoholic and a man who is revealed to be a cross-dresser. Also seen in the video is a woman struggling underwater to break free of the chains that bind her. LeBon and Taylor's Vivienne Westwood wardrobe were likely a nod to the band's early New Romantic era.\n\n\n                               ***Come Undone.***\n\n                                     Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7b02c49281a8b46b1a4842eddf2196c2edd7a36","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+Come+Undone+%281993%29%28Full+%26Clean%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7b02c49281a8b46b1a4842eddf2196c2edd7a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,176,44,73,40,26,139,70,177,164,132,46,221,242,25,108,46,221,122,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
