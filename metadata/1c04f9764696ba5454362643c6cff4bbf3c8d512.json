This emotionally charged drama follows the story of Axel (Cassavetes), a \n\ndrifter newly arrived in New York City, who goes to work in the West Side Terminal as a porter and immediately makes the acquaintance of Tommy \n\n(Poitier), an experienced and cordial porter who is as generous with his friends as he is with his customers. Scenes such as the first meeting between Axel \n\nand Tommy's family, as well as the confrontations between Axel and his surly boss (Jack Warden), convey the confidence and compassion that steadily \n\ngrows between the two men. As the two men confront societal prejudices, Axel is forced to examine himself and his community. In a film often compared \n\nto On the Waterfront, director Ritt displays an intuitive insight, simultaneously subtle and sharp. \n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : Edge Of The City.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 066 Kbps\nLength            : 1.24 GiB for 1h 25mn 44s 223ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 480 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #3           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050347&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050347&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese\n\nMy rip.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c04f9764696ba5454362643c6cff4bbf3c8d512","amp;dn":"Edge+Of+The+City+%281957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c04f9764696ba5454362643c6cff4bbf3c8d512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,4,249,118,70,150,186,84,84,54,38,67,198,207,244,187,243,200,213,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
