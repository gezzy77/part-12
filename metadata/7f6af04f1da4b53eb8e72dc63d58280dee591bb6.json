Their survival is threatened by mysterious entities including polar bears, an unseen creature that roams the jungle, and the island's malevolent inhabitants known as the &quot;Others&quot;. They encounter a Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau who was shipwrecked on the island over 16 years earlier and find a mysterious metal hatch buried in the ground. An attempt is made to leave the island on a raft.\n\nSeason 2 (2005-2006)\n\n\nSeason 2 featured 24 episodes that aired on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm in the United States and Canada beginning September 21, 2005.

While some mysteries are resolved, new questions are raised. New characters are introduced, including the tail-section survivors and other island inhabitants. More island mythologies and insights into the survivors' pasts are divulged. The hatch is explored and the existence of the DHARMA Initiative and its benefactor, the Hanso Foundation, are revealed.

Season five follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island where the remaining survivors erratically jump forward and backward through time until they are finally stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1977. The second continues the original timeline which takes place both off the island; and following the Oceanic Six's return to the island on Ajira Airways Flight 316 in 2007.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6af04f1da4b53eb8e72dc63d58280dee591bb6","amp;dn":"Lost+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4+and+5+%5BEnglish+Subtitles+Only%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6af04f1da4b53eb8e72dc63d58280dee591bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,106,240,79,29,164,181,62,184,231,45,198,61,88,40,13,238,89,27,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
