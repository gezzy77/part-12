Griffith's music had seen a turn from her original folk music base into more commercially viable country music in her previous two albums. On the current album she enlists the hit-making talents of veteran country producer Tony Brown. While this album would garner her first appearance on the Billboard Country charts, Griffith would never become a major country star. The album rose to #23 on the Country Albums chart, but that would be as high as any of her albums would ever climb. The title track, &quot;Lone Star State of Mind,&quot; would become the first of only two singles ever to enter the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart; it topped out at #36, while two other singles from the album could only gain much lower positions: &quot;Cold Hearts/Closed Minds&quot; at #64, and &quot;Trouble in the Fields&quot; at #57.\n\n[edit] Track listing\nAll tracks composed by Nanci Griffith; except where indicated\n\n&quot;Lone Star State of Mind&quot; (Fred Koller, Patrick Alger, Gene Levine) - 3:56 \n&quot;Cold Hearts/Closed Minds&quot; - 2:40 \n&quot;From a Distance&quot; (Julie Gold) - 4:10 \n&quot;Beacon Street&quot; - 2:49 \n&quot;Nickel Dreams&quot; (Mac McAnally, Don Lowery) - 2:48 \n&quot;Sing One for Sister&quot; (Robert Earl Keen, Jr.) - 3:20 \n&quot;Ford Econoline&quot; - 2:10 \n&quot;Trouble in the Fields&quot; (Griffith, Rick West) - 3:18 \n&quot;Love in a Memory&quot; - 3:17 \n&quot;Let It Shine on Me&quot; (Paul Kennerley) - 2:59 \n&quot;There's a Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret)&quot; - 4:21\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da73a6db390281a126a6ff6d343784c7ec037fe8","amp;dn":"Nanci+Griffith...Lone+Star+State+of+Mind%281987%29cdrip%5BFLAC%5D---DICK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da73a6db390281a126a6ff6d343784c7ec037fe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,115,166,219,57,2,129,161,38,166,255,109,52,55,132,199,236,3,127,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
