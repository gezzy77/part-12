It aims to help enrich the ways in which we view both male sex work as a field of commerce and male sex worker themselves.\n\nLeading contributors examine the field both historically and cross-culturally from fields including public health, sociology, psychology, social services, history, filmography, economics, mental health, criminal justice, geography, and migration studies, and more.\n\nSynthesizing introductions by the editors help the reader understand the implications of the findings and conclusions for scholars, practitioners, students, and members of the interested/concerned public.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3cc1f3250bf574bdac0fced7b6701297c1cd02","amp;dn":"Male+Sex+Work+and+Society+%28Victor+Minichiello+and+John+Scott%29+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3cc1f3250bf574bdac0fced7b6701297c1cd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,60,193,243,37,11,245,116,189,172,15,206,215,182,112,18,151,193,205,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
