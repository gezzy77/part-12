RCA released a &quot;Stereo-Orthophonic&quot; two-track tape of  the Grofe performance around the same time (ECS-17). The original Boston Pops performance under Fiedler was never issued in stereo either on LP or CD and was supplanted by another performance recorded some years later. This is a transfer of the original two-track tape from 1955 that has been in my collection for three decades or so. The mono Red Seal is a sought-after vinyl collectible and this performance is about as good as they come. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7de87cb91ea365d54dcf375615355d3083dc09d","amp;dn":"Grand+Canyon+Suite+-+Rare+Early+Stereo+Recording+by+Boston+Pops","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7de87cb91ea365d54dcf375615355d3083dc09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,222,135,203,145,234,54,93,84,220,243,117,97,83,85,211,8,61,192,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
