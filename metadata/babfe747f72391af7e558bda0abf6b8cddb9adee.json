Nowhere else in Florida does such a grand and magnificent display of nineteenth century wood frame structures survive. Few other cities in America can claim such a collection of Victorian houses. These photographic images represent an exploration into the basic simplicity and virtual timelessness of architectural forms in Key West. They impart,  too, a sense of diversity within building styles typified by common features.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babfe747f72391af7e558bda0abf6b8cddb9adee","amp;dn":"Portraits+-+Wooden+Houses+of+Key+West+%28Architecture+Photo%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babfe747f72391af7e558bda0abf6b8cddb9adee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,191,231,71,247,35,145,175,126,85,139,218,10,191,107,140,221,185,173,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
