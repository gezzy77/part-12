Members of the Heaven's Gate suicide cult believed they were taking a ride to heaven on board a UFO. Muslim suicide bombers expect to be greeted after death by 72 heavenly virgins. And many fundamentalist Christians insist the entire universe is just 6,000 years old. Of course it's not only cults and religions that promote bizarre beliefs. Significant numbers of people believe that aliens built the pyramids, that the Holocaust never happened, and that the World Trade Center was brought down by the US government.\n\nHow do such ridiculous views succeed in entrenching themselves in the minds of sane, intelligent, college-educated people and turn them into the willing slaves of claptrap? How, in particular, do the true believers manage to convince themselves that they are the rational, reasonable ones and that everyone else is deluded?\n\nBelieving Bullshit identifies eight key mechanisms that can transform a set of ideas into a psychological flytrap. Philosopher Stephen Law suggests that, like the black holes of outer space, from which nothing, not even light, can escape, our contemporary cultural landscape contains numerous intellectual black-holesÃ¢â‚¬â€belief systems constructed in such a way that unwary passers-by can similarly find themselves drawn in. While such self-sealing bubbles of belief will most easily trap the gullible or poorly educated, even the most intelligent and educated of us are potentially vulnerable. Some of the world's greatest thinkers have fallen in, never to escape.\n\nA philosophy professor at the University of London, Law describes eight &quot;intellectual black holes,&quot; traps that seem to lend credence to scientifically or rationally incorrect propositions. Recognizing such black holes as &quot;playing the mystery card&quot; (e.g., arguing that science can tell us whether ghosts exist) will help readers identify and critique illogical arguments. One particularly interesting concept is the &quot;blunderbuss,&quot; which cites real but irrelevant illogical elements of, say, certain New Age beliefs. Another concept is what philosopher Daniel Dennett once called a &quot;deepity,&quot; which Law defines as &quot;saying something with two meanings&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€one true but trivial, the other false but seemingly profound. Law shows how these and other verbal sleights of hand are used in a wide variety of belief systems, including the paranormal, homeopathy, Christian Science, and belief in UFOs. Law includes an entertaining appendix of fictional letters called, pace C.S. Lewis, the &quot;Tapescrew Letters,&quot; which recapitulate his eight logical black holes. Though he writes clearly and persuasively, this is not a particularly easy read, but his subject is important and deserving of readers' attention.\nGenre: Non-fiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb55722959379000d14df62334c7941c2fd5a856","amp;dn":"Believing+Bullshit+How+Not+to+Get+Sucked+into+an+Intellectual+Bl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb55722959379000d14df62334c7941c2fd5a856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,85,114,41,89,55,144,0,209,77,246,35,52,199,148,28,47,213,168,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
