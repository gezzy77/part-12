Many of the terms used in landscape architecture, land planning, environmental planning, and landscape construction are unavailable, or so new, or industry-specific that they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be found in conventional dictionaries. This unique resource delivers definitions as well as how-to information via details and photos, going above and beyond the scope of a typical professional dictionary. With straightforward definitions and clear illustrations on each page, everyone from architects, designers, and contractors through grounds maintenance workers will benefit from this important resource. In addition, an appendix with labeled construction details will illustrate not just what a term means, but also how itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s applied in the profession.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02e740f47895ce1eb1947f7d3a6f4c1925d2897","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Landscape+Architecture+and+Construction+-+%28Malestr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02e740f47895ce1eb1947f7d3a6f4c1925d2897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,46,116,15,71,137,92,225,235,25,71,247,211,166,244,193,146,93,40,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
