Damon Harris had replaced Eddie Kendricks, and there were many doubters convinced the band was finished.\nInstead, Whitfield revitalized them via the majestic single, &quot;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone.&quot; Despite its length, Whitfield's decision to open with an extensive, multi-layered musical suite and tease listeners was a master stroke.\nBy the time Dennis Edwards' voice came rushing in, no one would dare turn it off. The single, as well as &quot;Law Of The Land&quot; and others, ended the funeral arrangements that had been prepared for The Temptations.
