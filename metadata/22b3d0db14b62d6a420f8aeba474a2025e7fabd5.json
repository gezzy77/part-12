While it does not\ncontain &quot;Don't Ask Me Again,&quot; opting to instead select a couple merely decent\nhighlights from 1999's Peace, two new (unplanned) recordings add value for any\nkind of fan. Bookending the disc, &quot;I've Got a Life&quot; is powerful disco-pop with Annie\nLennox strongly present over a bursting multi-tiered arrangement, while the\nrelatively low-key &quot;Was It Just Another Affair&quot; has more in common with late-period\nEverything But the Girl. Both songs pleasingly sound the way Eurythmics should\nsound in 2005. The rest of the disc leans toward the duo's peak of popularity,\n1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge, while the remainder\nof the albums -- with the exception of the unrepresented In the Garden, the debut --\nchime in with two or three songs each. A truly ultimate collection would contain two\ndiscs and dig deeper into some of the best album cuts, rather than rely on charting\nsingles, but this disc will sufficiently satisfy the casual fans who just want the songs\nthey know and love..[/b][/color]\n\n\n\n [color=maroon][b]  1.
