It is written both for those who have never presented before in English and are very nervous at the prospect and those with experience who simply want tips on how to improve their international conference or meeting presentation skills. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I can highly recommend this book which is also reasonably priced.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Hashim Hashim and Jane Meijlink, ICS News, Vol. 7 (1), January, 2011)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This slim book is aimed at presenters with English as their second language (ESL), and specifically at scientific researchersÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œan unfortunate choice, as this book has far broader appeal. It provides a great introduction for anyone who must learn the art of presentations and a refresher for experienced presenters. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I can unreservedly recommend this book for ESL presenters, English presenters with ESL audiences, and anyone who needs to learn or polish their presentation skills.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Geoff Hart, Technical Communication, Vol. 58 (4), November, 2011)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book, easy to understand, will focus on the issues faced by those non native English speakers. It is designed to help them by providing them with rules and tips on, for instance, gaining and maintaining audience attention, handling questions and answers from the audience as well as highlighting examples taken from real presentations. This guide is thus also highly recommended for trainers in English for academic purposes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (ESNA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bulletin, Issue 83, December, 2011)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Wallwork has written a helpful guide for those who struggle with presenting scientific results in person. The book is mainly intended for scientific speakers for whom English is not their primary language, but is also useful for native English speakers who have never presented before or who want to improve their presentation skills. In addition, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to add that the book is also useful for experienced presenters.\nThe book is written as a resource guide and Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ offers useful and practical advice. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Every chapter starts with an explanation as to why the point [Wallwork] makes is important. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ In the book youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find advice on how to effectively use English without getting stuck on difficult words or tortuous constructions, how to create effective and complementary slides, and how you and your slides can combine effectively during your presentation, so that the impact is as memorable as possible.\nI Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ recommend this book for anyone who is seeking to gain confidence as a scientific speaker or who wants to improve his or her presentation skills. Although the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeath-by-PowerpointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ syndrome, characterised by slide after slide filled with formal and long textsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦delivered in a monotonous drone Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ that leaves you feeling sleepy, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ is still is ever-present around us, this book could be the right antidote for those who are willing to battle the syndrome.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Linda M. Liem, The Write Stuff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Journal of the European Medical Writers Association)\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nGood presentation skills are key to a successful career in academia.
