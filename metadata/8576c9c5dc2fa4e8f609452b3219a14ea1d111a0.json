Release: 1995.\n\n\n\nBluegrass (1970-1979) is a four-disc box set containing all of Monroe's '70s recordings for Decca, including several unreleased cuts and a live album featuring Jim &amp; Jesse, James Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Carl Jackson. By the time he made these recordings, Monroe was no longer making any innovations with his music. Instead, he just demonstrated his skill and artistry -- the music on Bluegrass (1970-1979) is for afficianados, the kind of listener that can discern subtle differences between supporting bands and solos. Overall, the material on the box isn't as strong as the previous two box sets, but any Monroe completist will not be disappointed by the set. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8576c9c5dc2fa4e8f609452b3219a14ea1d111a0","amp;dn":"Bill+Monroe+-+Bluegrass+1970-1979+-+Bear+Family+4CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8576c9c5dc2fa4e8f609452b3219a14ea1d111a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,118,201,197,220,47,164,232,246,9,69,43,50,25,161,78,161,209,17,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
