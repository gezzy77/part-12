It is really a worthy sequel to a Disney classic (unlike, Cinderella 2, Lion King 2,fox and the hound 2). And is way better than &quot;Belle&amp;#039;s Magical World&quot;. And antoher great thing about it is that it&amp;#039;s in the middle of the first film, and it happened to not ruin it. Because really if they make a fourth about them now, it&amp;#039;s won&amp;#039;t be as good because he&amp;#039;s not the beast! And the songs are beautiful! &quot;As long as there&amp;#039;s Christmas&quot; is great just a good film even with out the first 9/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a2999b8224e58fb42f0265576427ec2251a4ab","amp;dn":"Beauty.and.the.Beast.The.Enchanted.Christmas.DVDRIP.En.mkrFOF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a2999b8224e58fb42f0265576427ec2251a4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,162,153,155,130,36,229,143,180,47,2,101,87,100,39,236,34,81,164,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
