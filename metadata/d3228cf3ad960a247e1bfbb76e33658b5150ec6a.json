It is a story that begins with the sin of Adam and Eve, continues in the biographies of Moses, King David, and the Apostle Peter, and reverberates in the lives of believers today. Hahn presents the Catholic and biblical perspective on sin and mercy, elucidating in clear, easily understood language the true import of JesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ simple, yet profound promiseÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am the door; if anyone enters by Me, he will be saved (John 10:9). \n\nLike HahnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier books, Lord, Have Mercy offers thoughtful, authoritative insights into controversial issues and disputed doctrines in a manner that will enlighten lay readers yet is thorough enough for scholars to appreciate. More than just a Bible study, it is a guide for the perplexed, providing practical advice and inspiration that will help readers come to a deeper knowledge of themselves and of Jesus through the sacrament of penance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3228cf3ad960a247e1bfbb76e33658b5150ec6a","amp;dn":"The+Healing+Power+of+Confession+%28Dr.+Scott+Hahn%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3228cf3ad960a247e1bfbb76e33658b5150ec6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,34,140,243,173,150,10,36,126,27,251,183,110,51,101,139,81,80,236,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
