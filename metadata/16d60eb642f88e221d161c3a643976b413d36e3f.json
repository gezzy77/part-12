Theo knows every judge, policeman, court clerk - and a lot about the law. He dreams of a life in the courtroom. But he finds himself in court much sooner than expected. Because he knows so much - maybe too much - he is suddenly dragged into the middle of a sensational murder trial. A cold-blooded killer is about to go free, and only Theo knows the truth. The stakes are high, but Theo won't stop until justice is served.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d60eb642f88e221d161c3a643976b413d36e3f","amp;dn":"The+Abduction-+John+Grisham++%5BEDGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d60eb642f88e221d161c3a643976b413d36e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,214,14,182,66,248,142,34,29,22,28,58,100,57,118,180,19,211,110,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
