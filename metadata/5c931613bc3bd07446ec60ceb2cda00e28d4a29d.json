(1987), Paul Hawken talks about starting a business from scratch and how conventional wisdom about such ventures is what is destroying new business start ups.\n\nHawken has updated his material, but there is enough solid advice in this audio book to help those interested in starting a business in a hostile economy. This particular audio book is no longer available as a collection. This torrent was made from a 27-year old tape and though cleaned up with the audio program Audacity, you may experience occasional lapses in quality and/or volume. Once caveat: Hawken is very much into new age woo woo, but the vast majority of his advice is still rock solid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c931613bc3bd07446ec60ceb2cda00e28d4a29d","amp;dn":"Growing+A+Business+-+Paul+Hawkin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c931613bc3bd07446ec60ceb2cda00e28d4a29d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,147,22,19,188,59,208,116,70,236,96,206,178,205,160,14,40,212,162,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
