The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n\n\n\n                                         Thelonious Himself\n\n\n\n\nThelonious Himself is a 1957 album by Thelonious Monk and his first to consist of exclusively solo material including &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;, Monk's most famous composition. The original CD reissue includes a revelatory 22 minutes of &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; outtakes, ideas, and development. The Keepnews Collection edition omits this sequence. In the liner notes Keepnews states that including it &quot;would have required eliminating virtually every existing alternate take of other selections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ five other examples of this pianist's improvisational genius.&quot;\n\nThe album was originally released in June 1959, featuring saxophonist John Coltrane.\n\n\n\n\n Track listing\n\n\n   1. &quot;April in Paris&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n   2. &quot;(I Don't Stand) A Ghost of a Chance (With You)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n   3. &quot;Functional&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:18\n   4. &quot;I'm Getting Sentimental Over You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n   5. &quot;I Should Care&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:52\n   6. &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:39\n   7. &quot;All Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n   8. &quot;Monk's Mood&quot; - 7:43\n\n\n Performers\n\n    * Thelonious Monk - Piano\n    * John Coltrane - Tenor Sax\n    * Wilbur Ware - bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0767d0009c73ce7465890593cea132568a4ce7","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk+-+Thelonious+Himself+-+Vinyl+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0767d0009c73ce7465890593cea132568a4ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,7,103,208,0,156,115,206,116,101,137,5,147,206,161,50,86,138,76,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
