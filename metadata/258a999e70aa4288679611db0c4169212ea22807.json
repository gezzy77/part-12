It was directed by Robert Rossen and starred Broderick Crawford in the role of Willie Stark.\n\nPlot\n\nAll The King's Men is the story of the rise of politician Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) from a rural county seat to the governor's mansion. He first teaches himself law and becomes a lawyer, championing the local people and gaining popularity. He then decides to go into politics. Along the way he loses his innocence, and becomes as corrupt as the politicians he once fought against.\n\nThe main story is a thinly disguised version of the rise and assassination of real-life 1930s Louisiana Governor, Huey Long. Also included is a series of complex relationships between a journalist friend who slowly sours to his ways, the journalist's girlfriend (who has an affair with Stark), her brother (a top surgeon), her uncle (a top judge who is appointed AG but eventually resigns).\n\nWhen his son becomes paralyzed following a drunk driving accident which kills a female passenger, Stark's world starts to unravel and he discovers that not everyone can be bought off.\n\nThe story has a complex series of relationships. All is seen through the vexes of the journalist, Jack Burden, who admires Stark and even when disenfranchised still sticks by him. Stark's campaign assistant, Sadie (Mercedes McCambridge) is clearly in love with Stark and wants him to leave his wife, Lucy. Meanwhile Stark philanders and gets involved with many women, most notably Jack's own girlfriend, Anne Stanton.\n\nWhen Stark's reputation is brought into disrepute by Judge Stanton (Anne's father) he seeks to blacken his name. When he eventually succeeds the judge commits suicide. Anne seems to forgive him, but her brother, a doctor and the surgeon who helped saved his son's life after the car crash, cannot. The doctor eventually assassinates Stark after he wins an impeachment investigation. The doctor in turn is shot down by Sugar Boy, Stark's fawning assistant.\n\nCast\n\nBroderick Crawford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Willie Stark\nJohn Ireland ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jack Burden\nJoanne Dru ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Anne Stanton\nJohn Derek ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tom Stark\nMercedes McCambridge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sadie Burke\nShepperd Strudwick ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Adam Stanton\nRalph Dumke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Tiny Duffy\nAnne Seymour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mrs. Lucy Stark\nKatherine Warren ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mrs. Burden (as Katharine Warren)\nRaymond Greenleaf ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Judge Monte Stanton\nWalter Burke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sugar Boy\nWill Wright ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dolph Pillsbury\nGrandon Rhodes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Floyd McEvoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:258a999e70aa4288679611db0c4169212ea22807","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1949+-+All+the+King%5C%27s+Men","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"258a999e70aa4288679611db0c4169212ea22807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,138,153,158,112,170,66,136,103,150,17,219,12,65,105,33,46,162,40,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
