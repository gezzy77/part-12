If you only knew the magic keystrokes, your work would be easier, the results would be richer and more complete, and all your friends would be impressed. Besides, spreadsheet skills are eminently marketable. Interns and graduates regularly return and report that knowing spreadsheet magic truly sets them apart from the competition and opens the doors to bigger and better opportunities. MBAs are particularly aware of this indicating that their starting salaries are $4,000-12,000 more if they have these advanced spreadsheet skills.\r\nThis class is intended to help you gain those skills. While we canâ€™t hope to cover everything that Excel offers, we can expand your bag of tools that you use regularly, and open the door to new ideas. Here are some of the skills you will learn:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Tips and tricks for working with menus, formats, and navigation\r\nâ€¢ Using cell and range names effectively\r\nâ€¢ Excel functions for statistics, mathematics, or finance\r\nâ€¢ Interact with web servers to automatically retrieve current data off the Internet\r\nâ€¢ Retrieve data from corporate databases\r\nâ€¢ Connect optimization models and Pivot tables directly to large databases\r\nâ€¢ Financial decision analysis models and megaformulas\r\nâ€¢ Using arrays\r\nâ€¢ Build forms for user input and parameter specifications\r\nâ€¢ Change and control Excelâ€™s ribbon buttons (or just add your own)\r\nâ€¢ Learn the basics of Visual Basic for Applications (no prior experience needed)\r\n\r\nCourse Outline\r\n\r\nSYLLABUS - IS 515\r\n\r\nClass\tReading/Homework\r\n1.\tChapter 3: Working With Names\r\n2.\tChapter 22: Tools and Methods for Debugging Formulas\r\n3.\tChapter 6: Working with Dates and Times\r\n4.\tChapter 17: Charting Techniques\r\n5.\tChapter 19: Conditional Formatting &amp; Data Validation\r\n6.\tChapter 9: Databases &amp; Lists\r\n7.\tChapters 14-15: Arrays and Performing Magic with Array Formulas\r\n8.\tCircular References and Decision-Making\r\n9.\tChapter 18: Pivot Tables\r\n10. \tChapter 11: Introducing Financial Formulas\r\n11.\tChapter 12: Advanced Financial Formulas\r\n\r\nMidterm Exam\r\n\r\n12.\tChapter 7: Counting and Summing Techniques\r\n13.\tChapter 8: Lookups\r\n14.\tChapter 5: Manipulating Text\r\n15.\tChapter 21: Megaformulas\r\n16.\tChapter 16: Importing and Cleaning Data\r\n17.\tChapters 23-26: Day 1: Visual Basic Intro &amp; Function Basics\r\n18.\tChapters 23-26: Day 2: Visual Basic Programming Functions\r\n19.\tChapters 23-26: Day 3: Visual Basic Declaring Functions\r\n20.\tVBA Follow-Up and Help Session\r\n21.\tChapter 10: Misc.
