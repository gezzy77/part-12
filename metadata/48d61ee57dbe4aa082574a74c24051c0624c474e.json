Making your morning omelet, perhaps you've wondered why most eggs are egg shaped. Or maybe, the last time you walked on the beach, you felt compelled to ask why the sea is salty. Watching Polly sit on her perch, have you ever marveled at how she stays there even when she's asleep? Well, the readers of New Scientist's wildly popular, long-running column &quot;The Last Word&quot; thought of these questions, too, and weren't afraid to ask them.\n\nWhy Don't Penguins' Feet Freeze? is a brilliant collection of questions and answers for everyone who enjoyed the international, runaway bestseller Does Anything Eat Wasps? Guaranteed to amaze, inform, and delight with topics such as the human body, plants and animals, weird weather, and our wacky world, it'll stump you, enlighten you, entertain and amuse you\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d61ee57dbe4aa082574a74c24051c0624c474e","amp;dn":"Why+Don%5C%27t+Penguins%5C%27+Feet+Freeze%3F+++%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d61ee57dbe4aa082574a74c24051c0624c474e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,214,30,229,125,190,74,160,130,87,74,116,194,64,81,192,98,76,71,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
