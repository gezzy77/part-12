Emphasis is placed on the modeling of asphalt mixes for specific geographic/climatic requirements.\nIn light of America's crumbling infrastructure and our heavy usage of asphalt as a paving material, this timely reference is essential for the development of more-durable and cost-effective asphalt materials for both new construction and rehabilitation.\nHarness the Latest Breakthroughs in Asphalt Concrete Technology:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Asphalt Rheology ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Constitutive Models ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stiffness Characterization ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Models for Low-Temperature Cracking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Models for Fatigue Cracking and Moisture Damage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Models for Rutting and Aging\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6d58c0d74b947cf16950e0f5fe5c6b474774a7","amp;dn":"Modeling+of+asphalt+concrete+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6d58c0d74b947cf16950e0f5fe5c6b474774a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,109,88,192,215,75,148,124,241,105,80,224,245,254,92,107,71,71,116,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
