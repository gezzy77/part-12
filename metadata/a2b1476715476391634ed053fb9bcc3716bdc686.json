Life Is Grand\n\nWith Lowery's by-now more sharply sung words up front and Segel's multi-instrumental abilities helping to lead the way, the quintet came up trumps more often than not. &quot;Eye of Fatima (pt. 2),&quot; for instance, could have easily fit in on most of the group's earlier records at the start. Even so, the addition of some screaming Lisher guitar solos on top of the measured reggae/hard rock/folk stew cooked up didn't feel anything like, say, Eddie Van Halen's drop-in on &quot;Beat It.&quot; Distinctly nonrock tempos and touches run merrily rampant as always, as a listen to the fiddle, dub and brass revamp of the traditional number &quot;O Death&quot; demonstrates. However, the fivesome can pump it up when needed -- the group's appreciation of Led Zeppelin certainly hasn't dimmed any, based on the majestic stomp of &quot;Waka.&quot; When CVB aim to create something possibly more radio-friendly, the members pull it off in their own way rather than anyone else's. Thus, the almost anthemic &quot;She Divines Water,&quot; with some great Segel violin work, or the gentler groove of &quot;One of These Days.&quot; Add in multitudes of other joys like the fun romp &quot;My Path Belated&quot; and Bruce Licher's clever cover art -- at one point you see Bob Dylan looking towards a Turkish music combo in another photo with resignation -- and once again CVB create an enjoyable, not-easily-pegged down listening experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b1476715476391634ed053fb9bcc3716bdc686","amp;dn":"Camper+Van+Beethoven+-+Our+Beloved+Revolutionary+Sweetheart+%5B198","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b1476715476391634ed053fb9bcc3716bdc686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,177,71,103,21,71,99,145,99,78,208,83,251,155,204,55,22,189,198,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
