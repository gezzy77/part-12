Bobby Harris formed the group in the late '70s, merging two Cleveland funk bands, Bell Telefunk and Mother Braintree. After myriad lineup changes, the end result was an eight-piece band featuring Harris, Skip Martin III, Pierre DeMudd on horns and vocals, guitarist Eric Fearman, bassist Michael Wiley, drummer Isaac Wiley, keyboardist Kevin Frederick, and percussionist Kenny Pettus. Harris and lead songwriter/guitarist Mike Calhoun's concept for the group was &quot;danceable jazz&quot;; he shortened the description to &quot;dazz&quot; and called the group Kinsman Dazz. Under that name, the group had two small hits in the U.S.A. during 1978 and 1979. After Calhoun left they changed their name to the Dazz Band in 1980 and signed to Motown. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown\nCatalog:\t\tAA3145567712\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Let It Whip\n02.Keep It Live (On The K.I.L.)\n03.Joystick\n04.I Might As Well Forget About Loving You\n05.Party Right Here\n06.To The Roof\n07.Swoop (I'm Yours)\n08.Invitation To Love\n09.Knock!
