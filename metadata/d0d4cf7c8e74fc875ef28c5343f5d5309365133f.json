While traveling they are free to act single, adopting the mantra &quot;what happens in Europe, stays in Europe.&quot; But hours into Ryan's adventure with his party animal and womanizing best friend Brandon (Dillon Casey, Nikita), he realizes he's made a huge mistake and sets off in search of her. The only problem is he has no idea where she could be - they never exchanged itineraries. This marks the start of a wild adventure that takes the duo to the Amalfi coast, Rome, Berlin, Prague and Paris as they search for Beth, try to avoid an annoying Aussie, dodge a homicidal maniac and fit in a little action on the way.\n[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0d4cf7c8e74fc875ef28c5343f5d5309365133f","amp;dn":"Backpackers.S01E01.HDTV.x264-ASAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0d4cf7c8e74fc875ef28c5343f5d5309365133f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,212,207,124,142,116,252,135,94,242,140,83,67,245,213,48,147,101,19,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
