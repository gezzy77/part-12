Poultry authority Gail Damerow explains exactly how to hatch healthy baby chickens, ducklings, goslings, turkey poults, and guinea keets, addressing everything from selecting a breed and choosing the best incubator to ensuring proper set-up and sanitary conditions, understanding embryo development, and feeding and caring for newborn chicks in a brooder. This is an indispensable reference for any poultry raiser, whether you want to hatch three eggs or one hundred.\n\n\nBy Gail Damerow\nPublished by Storey Publishing in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:698fa19fcf9417b02e357cf38c56acba34805f43","amp;dn":"Hatching+and+Brooding+Your+Own+Chicks%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"698fa19fcf9417b02e357cf38c56acba34805f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,143,161,159,207,148,23,176,46,53,124,243,140,86,172,186,52,128,95,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
