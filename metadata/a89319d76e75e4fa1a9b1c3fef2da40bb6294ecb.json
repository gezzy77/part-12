This massive new title follows the band from its roots in Sydney, Australia, to its most recent releases and sold-out world tours. No stone is left unturned, from the AC/DCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formation and early club gigs to its astounding worldwide success. A special cover incorporating Angus on a spinning disc gives way to more than 400 illustrations include handbills, posters, backstage passes, and vinyl from around the globe, as well as rare candid and performance photography. Sidebars from top rock scribes examine all studio releases and delve into the guitar gear of the Young brothers. The result is an awesome tribute to the band renowned for a live-wire stage show and a sonic attack that have attracted fans from all rock camps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89319d76e75e4fa1a9b1c3fef2da40bb6294ecb","amp;dn":"ACDC+High+Voltage+Rock+%26lsquo%3Bn%26rsquo%3B+Roll+The+Ultimate+Illustr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89319d76e75e4fa1a9b1c3fef2da40bb6294ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,147,25,215,110,117,228,250,26,155,28,63,239,45,164,11,182,41,78,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
