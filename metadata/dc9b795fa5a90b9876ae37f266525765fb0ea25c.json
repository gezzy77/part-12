Grant and Mel Hynes is told from the point of view of a pair of sibling Russian Blue cats, with a tone and approach which has led to the comic being described as &quot;the Anti-Garfield.&quot;  Ebenezer is the smart one, often frustrated by the antics of his less-intelligent brother.  He is sarcastic and snarky, usually playing the straight cat to Snooch's blundering buffoonery.  Snooch is obese, clumsy, and not very bright.  But when danger threatens him or his brother, he is utterly fearless, bordering on psychotic.  (Which side of that border he's on is left up to the reader.) \n\nThis torrent collects &quot;Two Lumps&quot; comics from the strip's debut in 2004 through the end of 2014.  The comics are compiled into a set of CBR files, one for each year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9b795fa5a90b9876ae37f266525765fb0ea25c","amp;dn":"Two+Lumps+%28Web+Comic%29+-+Complete+through+2014+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9b795fa5a90b9876ae37f266525765fb0ea25c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,155,121,95,165,169,11,152,118,174,55,242,102,82,87,101,251,14,162,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
