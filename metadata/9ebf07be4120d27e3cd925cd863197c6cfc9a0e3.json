The dives are short, the fish move fast, and colors are filtered away by the water between your lens and the subject. You can bring back the full glory of sea life, though, by using the tools in Photoshop. In this course, expert Deke McClelland takes pictures from a recent dive in HondurasÃ¢â‚¬â€where he captured jellyfish, angelfish, parrotfish, sea turtles, octopi, moray eels, fire worms, and even a passing reef sharkÃ¢â‚¬â€and makes the images even more incredible with Photoshop's photo editing and enhancement tools. Learn how to correct contrast, enhance color, sharpen moving targets, correct distortion, and develop black-and-white versions of your images, as well as movies and animated GIFs. It's an ocean of creative possibilitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€as only Photoshop can offer. Watch and learn how to take your underwater photography to even greater depths.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Selecting the best frame of a fish in motion\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Correcting contrast\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Enhancing clarity\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Bringing out color and beauty in Camera Raw\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Sharpening a moving target with Shake Reduction\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Correcting lens distortion\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Developing black-and-white versions of underwater photos\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Creating a looping movie or animated GIF\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Framing macro shots\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Simulating depth of field with Gaussian Blur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebf07be4120d27e3cd925cd863197c6cfc9a0e3","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Enhancing+Underwater+Photos+with+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebf07be4120d27e3cd925cd863197c6cfc9a0e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,191,7,190,65,32,210,126,60,217,37,205,134,49,151,198,207,201,160,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
