A studious, \nlaw-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, \nis beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of \nOhioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at a local college \nin Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, \nhard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mad with fear \nand apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, \nthe dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy. \n\nAs the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the \nfatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too \nmuch anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any \nlonger. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, \nhas to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another \nAmerican world. \n\nIndignation, Philip RothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twenty-ninth book, tells the story of the \nyoung manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s education in lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s terrifying chances and bizarre \nobstructions. It is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual \nresistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with \nall the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a \nstartling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience \nin his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the \nimpact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual. \n - - -\n\nAmazon.com Review\n\nAmazon Best of the Month, September 2008: Enter once again into the echo \nchamber of Philip Roth's memory and imagination. In the second year of \nthe Korean War, a butcher's son--a straight-A student wound tight with \naspiration--flees Newark and his father's increasingly unhinged fears for \nhis safety. Heading midwest, he finds a strange collegiate land of \nfraternities, football heroes, V-neck pullover sweaters and white \nbuckskin shoes, panty raids, and mandatory chapel services, and, most \nstartlingly, a young woman with desires of her own. Like another fiction \ngrandmaster of his generation, Alice Munro, Roth seems able to spin \ninfinite surprising tales from a few familiar building blocks, and in \nIndignation, his 25th novel, he has constructed a taut, haunting (and, as \nalways, funny) story that ranks among his best. Reading at times like a \nbuttoned-down Portnoy's Complaint (if it's possible to imagine such a \nthing), Indignation records a series of small explosions against '50s \npropriety and the dire consequences they lead to, capturing the misery of \ndesire amid repression, along with the greater terror of being trapped in \nendless, relentless memory.\n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n&gt;&gt;Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26dee1306a831da9cc3437b50d0189de57ec88e","amp;dn":"INDIGNATION+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Dick+Hill+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a26dee1306a831da9cc3437b50d0189de57ec88e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,109,238,19,6,168,49,218,156,195,67,123,80,208,24,157,229,126,200,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
