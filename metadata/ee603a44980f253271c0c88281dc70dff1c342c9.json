Gaming's greatest dog and rabbit sleuths Sam &amp; Max seek the power's ancient secrets, as manic Max gains shape shifting, teleportation, mind reading and future vision abilities for battling these foes.\n\nSam &amp; Max: The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Playhouse is the third season in the acclaimed Sam &amp; Max series and features a bevy of episodes for you to enjoy. In The Penal Zone, Sam &amp; Max are visited by an evil space gorilla who is very keen on MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special toy. Discover Sam &amp; MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots as you take control of Sameth and Maximus, Sam &amp; MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early 20th century ancestors through a variety of film-reel adventures in The Tomb of Sammun-Mak. A bathroom break goes wrong when Sam finds Max with a serious case of missing brain syndrome in They Stole MaxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brain! A horde of Sam clones storm the city. Why are there clones of Sam? Why are they three-quarters naked? All these pressing questions are answered in Beyond the Alley of the Dolls. Max changes from our usual loveable hyperkinetic rabbity thing to a 50-ft. tall, city-rampaging, sending-out-floating-and-hypnotizing-heads thing and only Sam can save him in The City That Dared Not Sleep.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nTotal Overdose\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee603a44980f253271c0c88281dc70dff1c342c9","amp;dn":"Sam+%26amp%3B+Max+The+Devils+Playhouse+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee603a44980f253271c0c88281dc70dff1c342c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,96,58,68,152,15,37,50,113,192,200,130,129,220,112,223,241,195,66,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
