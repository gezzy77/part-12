The authors, under the sponsorship of the Center for Security Policy, have modeled this work on an earlier &quot;exercise in competitive analysis&quot; which came to be known as the &quot;Team B&quot; Report. The present Team B II report is based entirely on unclassified, readily available sources. As with the original Team B analysis, however, this study challenges the assumptions underpinning the official line in the conflict with today's totalitarian threat, which is currently euphemistically described as &quot;violent extremism,&quot; and the policies of co-existence, accommodation and submission that are rooted in those assumptions\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ff7a8d6960994f86c833e078b07fce427706b8","amp;dn":"Sharia-The+Threat+to+America+%282010%29pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ff7a8d6960994f86c833e078b07fce427706b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,255,122,141,105,96,153,79,134,200,51,224,120,176,127,206,66,119,6,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
