Billy Bob Holland is a lawyer for the people of sunbaked Deaf Smith, in southern Texas. Although occasionally he is haunted by memories of a violent past, his life is sereneÃ¢â‚¬â€until a local guitarist, Lucas Smothers, lands in jail for raping and murdering a young woman. As Billy Bob gathers information to defend him, the evidence soon points to the son of a wealthy local businessman. In the ensuing battle, money is pitted against the law. But a deeper struggle also arises, for Lucas is Billy BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegitimate son. Through Tom StechschulteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compelling narration, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll climb into Billy BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Avalon and thread through the neon-lit streets and crowded bars near the Mexican border. James Lee BurkeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid characters are aswirl in a world that will linger deep in your mind, like a crimson sunset in the western sky.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2bd0fee81caba017ab2575ebd684c326f40639f","amp;dn":"James+Burke-Cimarron+Rose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2bd0fee81caba017ab2575ebd684c326f40639f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,189,15,238,129,202,186,1,122,178,87,94,189,104,76,50,111,64,99,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
