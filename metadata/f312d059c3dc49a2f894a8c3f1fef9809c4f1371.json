Bradford, who provided\nus with a humorous caricature of David for the title sequence.\n\nThis 95-minute video features brand new material about the pineal gland, time-space, 2012 and Montauk that\nwe have never presented anywhere else before.\n\nWe deliberately focused in on the material your letters said you liked the most!\n\nGiving this material such a big splash for a public debut, in a video with this level of production value,\ninsures our protection ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a major reason why weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re giving it away for free!\n\nFilelist:\nDavid Wilcock The 2012 Enigma.avi\nDavid Wilcock The 2012 Enigma.txt\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 01.flv\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 02.flv\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 03.flv\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 04.flv\ntracked_by_h33t_com.txt\n\nFormat:\n\nDavid Wilcock The 2012 Enigma.avi\nVIDEO: 320 x 240\nCODEC: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nAUDIO: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nCODEC: 44100Hz  64 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo\nTIME: 1h 35min\n\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 01.flv\nVIDEO: 320 x 240\nCODEC: Flash/Sorenson\nAUDIO: MPEG-2 Layer 3\nCODEC: 22050Hz  64 kb/s , Monophonic\nTIME: 59min\n\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 02.flv\nVIDEO: 320 x 240\nCODEC: Flash/Sorenson\nAUDIO: MPEG-2 Layer 3\nCODEC: 22050Hz  64 kb/s , Monophonic\nTIME: 56min\n\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 03.flv\nVIDEO: 320 x 240\nCODEC: Flash/Sorenson\nAUDIO: MPEG-2 Layer 3\nCODEC: 22050Hz  64 kb/s , Monophonic\nTIME: 23min\n\nDavid Wilcock The Road to Ascension 04.flv\nVIDEO: 320 x 240\nCODEC: Flash/Sorenson\nAUDIO: MPEG-2 Layer 3\nCODEC: 22050Hz  64 kb/s , Monophonic\nTIME: 48min\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f312d059c3dc49a2f894a8c3f1fef9809c4f1371","amp;dn":"DAVID+WILCOCK+-+THE+2012+ENIGMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f312d059c3dc49a2f894a8c3f1fef9809c4f1371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,18,208,89,195,220,73,162,248,148,168,195,241,254,249,128,156,79,19,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
