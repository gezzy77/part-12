Traditional nanofabrication techniques, such as CVD, sol-gel, and self-assembly, have been intensively studied. However, the electrochemical nanofabrication technique, which offers huge benefits for manufacturing nanomaterials as well as broad applications in industries has not been paid much attention compare with the traditional nanofabrication methods. This book fits that niche. It summarizes different electrochemical nanofabrication methods and shows various essential applications in areas such as batteries, sensors, and many future applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dea364983027b49cf56ad437c139b6e6d3e92be","amp;dn":"Electrochemical+Nanofabrication+-+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dea364983027b49cf56ad437c139b6e6d3e92be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,234,54,73,131,2,123,73,207,86,173,67,124,19,155,110,109,62,146,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
