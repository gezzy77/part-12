Although it includes many of the king's most famous writings, The Workes remains practically unknown to the general populace. We once asked an antiquarian bookseller if he had a copy of James' Workes for sale. He responded, &quot;He [King James] never wrote anything.&quot;Given the scarcity of this primary source document, it is with great pleasure that the Miscellany Press presents this special unabridged facsimile edition of James' Workes of 1616--we know of no other facsimile or reprint edition as complete.Our edition of James' Workes includes easy-to-understand prefatory materials to help orient the reader to this fascinating volume. We are not sure how any history library could be considered complete without this important title.&quot;\n\nWritings include:\n-Two meditations\n-DÃƒÂ¦monologie\n-Basilicon doron\n-The trew law of free monarchies\n-A counter-blast to tobacco\n-A discourse of the powder treason\n-An apologie for the Oath of Allegiance\n-A prÃƒÂ¦monition to all Christian monarches, free princes and states\n-A declaration against Vorstius\n-A defence of the right of kings, against Cardinall Perron\n-Fiue speaches\n\nNotes: Page 266 was misprinted as 265.

The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union.\n\nThe origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date back to 1606. James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland in a personal union, although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the Saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes. King James also began to refer to a &quot;Kingdom of Great Britaine&quot;, although the union remained a personal one.\n\nHe achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. \nOn the night of 4Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5 November 1605, the eve of the state opening of the second session of James's first English Parliament, Catholic Guy Fawkes was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings. He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction. Fawkes and others implicated in the unsuccessful conspiracy were executed.\n\nUnder James, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture. James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as Daemonologie (1597), True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible that was named after him: the Authorised King James Version.\n\nLecture about King James","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:049f22b3d3fc49e6c7811589ae109e4362d0ce3d","amp;dn":"The+Workes+of+His+Majesty+King+James+VI+%26amp%3B+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"049f22b3d3fc49e6c7811589ae109e4362d0ce3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,159,34,179,211,252,73,230,199,129,21,137,174,16,158,67,98,208,206,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
