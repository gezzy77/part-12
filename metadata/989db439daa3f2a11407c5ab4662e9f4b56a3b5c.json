It is considered the holy grail for Sun Ra collectors. It was pieced together from the contributions of private collectors around the world, and sonically cleaned up far beyond the audio capabilities of the original vinyl they were pressed on. It also features a 36 page booklet, with liner notes written by four respected Ra experts, and contains historically significant photos. \n\n \t\n\nSun Ra   \tPrimary Artist \nFred Adams   \tTrumpet \nLuqman Ali   \tDrums \nMarshall Allen   \tAlto Saxophone, Oboe, Vocals \nArkestra   \tTrack Performer, Vocals \nSam Bankhead   \tVocals \nCalvin Barron   \tVocals \nRobert Barry   \tDrums, Percussion \nMickey Boss   \tTenor Saxophone \nRonnie Boykins   \tBass \nJothan Callins   \tFlugelhorn, Trumpet, Vocals \nWilliam Cochran   \tDrums \nDanny Davis   \tAlto Clarinet, Alto Saxophone, Conga, Flute, Vocals \nAkh Tal Ebah   \tTrumpet \nRichard Evans   \tBass \nAlvin Fielder   \tDrums \nBobby Fields   \tBaritone Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone \nLacy Gibson   \tElectric Guitar, Track Performer, Vocals \nJohn Gilmore   \tDrums, Percussion, Tenor Saxophone, Vocals \nWilburn Green   \tElectric Bass \nBuddy Guy   \tRhythm Guitar \nJon Hardy   \tDrums \nWayne Harris   \tTrumpet \nAli Hassan   \tTrombone \nDavid Henderson   \tVocals \nJames Herndon   \tTimbales, Timpani \nJim Herndon   \tTimbales, Timpani \nTyrone Hill   \tTrombone \nLynn Hollings   \tNarrator, Vocals \nArthur Hoyle   \tTrumpet \nJames Jacson   \tPercussion, Vocals \nClifford Jarvis   \tDrums, Percussion \nLittle Mack   \tTrack Performer, Vocals \nMobarak Mahmoud   \tRecitation \nCrumar Mainman   \tDrums \nStanley Morgan   \tConga \nNu-Sounds   \tTrack Performer \nPat Patrick   \tBaritone Saxophone, Percussion, Vocals \nJulian Priester   \tTrombone \nLucious Randolph   \tTrumpet \nMichael Ray   \tTrumpet \nJuanita Rogers   \tTrack Performer, Vocals \nJames Spaulding   \tAlto Saxophone \nVictor Sproles   \tBass \nWalter Strickland   \tTrumpet \nC.
