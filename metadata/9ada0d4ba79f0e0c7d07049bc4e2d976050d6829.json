Throughout the 1980s, the band accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many American record labels, they signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording their first album March 20, 1980, with Mike Reno (born in New Westminster, B.C. January 8, 1955 and previously with Moxy as Mike Rynoski) on lead vocals, Paul Dean (born in Vancouver, B.C. on February 19, 1946; previously with Streetheart and Scrubbaloe Caine) on guitars and vocals, Jim Clench (formerly of April Wine and BTO, who was born in Montreal May 1, 1949 but was quickly replaced by Scott Smith born in Winnipeg, MB on February 13, 1955) on bass guitar, Doug Johnson (born in New Westminster December 19, 1957) on keyboards, and Matt Frenette (born in Calgary on March 7, 1954) on drums (also a former Streetheart alumni). The band's hit singles, particularly &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;, have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock and classic hits radio stations across the United States and Canada. They are currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ada0d4ba79f0e0c7d07049bc4e2d976050d6829","amp;dn":"Loverboy+-+Turn+Me+Loose+%5B2007%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ada0d4ba79f0e0c7d07049bc4e2d976050d6829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,218,13,75,167,159,14,12,125,7,4,155,196,226,217,118,5,13,104,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
