The band's first completely independent release since their 1993 debut, Stereolithic reunites 311 with producer Scott &quot;Scotch&quot; Ralston, who previously helmed the band's 1997 album Transistor and 1998's Soundsystem. The pairing clearly works, and in a lot of ways, Stereolithic sounds like a classic 311 album. Still present are lead singer Nick Hexum's laid-back croon, Doug &quot;SA&quot; Martinez's positive-minded raps, guitarist Tim Mahoney's slick yet fuzz-heavy rock sound, and bassist Aaron &quot;P-Nut&quot; Willis and drummer Chad Sexton's funky, dance-oriented rhythms. Stereolithic is a longer album at 15 tracks, with a heavy emphasis on songs built around the rub between Mahoney's deep sonic guitar slabs and Hexum's sweet-toned vocals. Tracks like &quot;Ebb and Flow,&quot; &quot;Revelation of the Year,&quot; and &quot;The Great Divide&quot; are old-school, funk-infused jams rooted in '90s grunge and alternative hip-hop aesthetic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba8c1edbcde4e44d2d224bdcbc051c6fc7fe23f","amp;dn":"311+-+Stereolithic+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba8c1edbcde4e44d2d224bdcbc051c6fc7fe23f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,168,193,237,188,222,78,68,210,210,36,189,203,192,81,198,252,127,226,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
