Twenty-eight leading scholars provide a coherent, systematic, historical investigation of the rise of cities and towns in England, Scotland and Wales, examining not only the evolving networks and types of towns, but their economic, demographic, social, political, cultural and physical development. The contributors discuss pollution and disease, the resolution of social conflict, the relationships between towns and the surrounding countryside, new opportunities for leisure and consumption, the development of local civic institutions and identities, and the evolution of municipal and state responsibilities. This comprehensive volume gives unique insights into the development of the urban landscape. Its detailed overview and analyses of the problems and opportunities which arise shed historical light on many of the issues and challenges that we face today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc2ddcd7b049877508324fe593eadc46e695e18","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Urban+History+of+Britain+Vol+3+-++1840-1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc2ddcd7b049877508324fe593eadc46e695e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,194,221,205,123,4,152,119,80,131,36,254,89,62,173,196,110,105,94,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
