It soon became known as Bedlam Hospital. Even today, it's a name that conjures up images of madness and terror. And as Tony Robinson discovers in this Time Team Special, Bedlam's reputation is quite justified. The abuses that went on here in the name of medicine were enough to drive the most robust individuals to lunacy. Now, thanks to the redevelopment of Liverpool Street station for London's Crossrail, a new dig beside the site of the original hospital is uncovering numerous bodies in a medieval graveyard.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s14.postimg.org/9ywgr4q75/documentary_su_Time_Team_Special_58_The_Madnes.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s14.postimg.org/9ywgr4q75/documentary_su_Time_Team_Special_58_The_Madnes.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfaa44fd1736ef7abcab80c0b2086ada46d85dbb","amp;dn":"Time+Team+Special+58+-+The+Madness+of+Bedlam+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfaa44fd1736ef7abcab80c0b2086ada46d85dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,170,68,253,23,54,239,122,188,171,128,192,178,8,106,218,70,216,93,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
