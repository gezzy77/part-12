Filmmaker Phil Joanou (Heaven's Prisoners), a veteran music-video director and maker of the distractingly kinetic Three O'Clock High, finds a suitable outlet for his high energy in this juggernaut of a journey, which finds U2 collaborating with a black gospel choir and B.B. King, recording inside the legendary Sun Records studio, dropping by Graceland, and in a moment of fearlessness, performing the Beatles' &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; to exorcise Charles Manson's sick claim on the song.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\nDVD Release Date: November 23, 1999\nDirectors: Phil Joanou\nProducers: Michael Hamlyn, Paul McGuinness\n\nStar: Bono\nThe Edge\nAdam Clayton\nLarry Mullen Jr\nB.B.
