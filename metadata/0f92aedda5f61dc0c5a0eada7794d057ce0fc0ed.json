Buch's attack on the minister of defence is decisively refuted and it looks like the prime minister's demands in light of this new debacle might finally wear down Buch's determination.

Meanwhile, the focus of the investigation shifts once again and Brix goes out on a limb to take a risky decision.\n\nSarah Lund - Sofie Grabol\nThomas Buch -  Nicolas Bro\nKarina Munk Jorgensen - Charlotte Guldberg\nJens Peter Raben - Ken Vedsegaard\nTorsten Jarnvig - Flemming Enevold\nCarsten Plough - Preben Kristensen\nLouise Raben - Stine Praetorius\nLennart Brix - Morten Suurballe\nUlrik Strange - Mikael Birkkjaer\nChristian Sogaard - Carsten Bjornlun\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f92aedda5f61dc0c5a0eada7794d057ce0fc0ed","amp;dn":"The.Killing.2%28ForbrydelsenII%29.BBC.E08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f92aedda5f61dc0c5a0eada7794d057ce0fc0ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,146,174,221,165,246,29,192,197,160,234,218,119,148,208,87,206,15,192,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
