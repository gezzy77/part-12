Rather than falling into the bloatware trap that is common with graphics products, Xara has concentrated on creating the world's best implementation of the essential toolset that designers really need, in order to ensure that working with Xara X can be both highly creative and very productive. As well as all the drawing tools you would expect, Xara X offers options such as automated shadows, bevels and contours, pressure sensitive brush stroking, multi-stage graduated fills and feathering.\n\nXara Designer Pro (formerly Xtreme Pro) is our top of the range product and includes all the features and templates of Web Designer and Photo &amp; Graphic Designer. Plus it adds extra features that Pro designers need including support for PDF/X, PANTONEÃ‚Â® and color separations, multi-core processor support for extra speed, enhanced import/export filters, a pro version of the photo panorama tool and more.\n\nXara Designer Pro includes a complete 'website creation' feature that enables you to design multi-page websites with ease, including mouseover and pop-up effects, navbars and menus, animations and widgets. One click preview and ftp upload included. It's the world's most advanced WYSIWYG web page layout - and with no HTML skills required! Xara Photo and Graphic Designer and Designer Pro offer a genuinely easy way to create really efficient Flash animations.\n\nXara Designer Pro gives you total design freedom - using drag and drop you can literally place anything, anywhere on the page. And things which are normally difficult to achieve in HTML are a snap in Xara Designer Pro - for example text with curved edges, text or graphics at an angle, text flowing around objects - no problem! But Designer Pro has some clever tricks too, to make things easier for you - here's just a few of the things that will save you time and trouble: Liquid text flow around objects; easy mouseover, thumbnail and pop-up creation; automatic adjustment of photos to the correct web resolution; one-click change of site wide theme colors and shades; automatic color matching of imported objects such as buttons; and buttons and text panels that automatically stretch as you change the text.\n\nWorking with industry standards is vital, so Xara Designer Pro sites are W3C compliant, cross browser compatible (IE 5.5, Firefox, Safari, Chrome) and XHTML, CSS standards based.\n\nDesigner offers support for a huge range of file formats, making it easy to exchange your work with other users and programs. This includes common bitmap types (eg GIF, JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIFF, PSD, and RAW photos) and key vector types (eg PDF and AI/EPS, and EMF/WMF). For text Xara Designer supports RTF (Rich Text Format) and for websites HTML and Flash.\n\nXara Designer has full support for importing and exporting Adobe PhotoshopÃ‚Â® PSD files including layer support. Xara Designer offers industry leading export of super-clean, very compact PDF files (including support for graduated color fills and flat / graduated transparency). Combined with the PDF import feature, this provides another way to interchange files.\n\nXara Designer Pro offers the ability to produce CMYK color separations. This includes on-screen preview of CMYK and spot color plates, PANTONEÃ‚Â® color support, spot colors, on-screen printer gamut preview and a lot more.\n\nXara Designer Pro supports XPS export (and has a beta XPS import filter). This is an entirely new Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpage descriptionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ file format invented by Microsoft that's vector based, and so is ideal as a resolution-independent portable document format.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8\n\nHomepage: http://www.xara.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Copy content from crack folder and paste into default installation directory.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c309930859dcdce25deee81caa110ccdbb3ec2b7","amp;dn":"Xara+Designer+Pro++X9+v9.2.3.29638+%28x86%29+Incl+Crack+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c309930859dcdce25deee81caa110ccdbb3ec2b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,9,147,8,89,220,220,226,93,238,232,28,170,17,12,205,187,62,194,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
