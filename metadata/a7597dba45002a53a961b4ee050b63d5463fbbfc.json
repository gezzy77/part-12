The record went on to sell over 8,000 copies through word of mouth alone, and a year later the guys were signed to Chicago powerhouse Victory Records. Work quickly began on their label debut; For Those Who Have Heart appeared in January 2007, featuring new drummer Alex Shelnutt. Homesick, the band's sophomore release, arrived in October 2009. After Homesick, Tom Denney left the band (although he remained a part of the writing process) while Kevin Skaff (from Four Letter Lie) assumed the guitar duties. The group's fourth studio album, What Separates Me From You, was released the following year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7597dba45002a53a961b4ee050b63d5463fbbfc","amp;dn":"A+Day+To+Remember+-+Discography+%282005-10%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7597dba45002a53a961b4ee050b63d5463fbbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,89,125,186,69,0,42,83,169,97,180,238,5,11,99,213,70,63,187,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
