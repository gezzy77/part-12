Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, Thomas tracks down and befriends Luke, who tells Thomas he is hiding because he did something so bad, he could be sent away from the Island of Sodor forever. Thomas does not believe this and sets off on a journey to discover the truth behind the story of the poor runaway engine. On the way, he learns of engines brought to Sodor from faraway lands and of an accident at Brendam Docks where an engine fell into the sea. But only when he has learned every piece of the story, can Thomas convince his new friend that there is no reason to hide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c3736e2f3228ebce7327842d20b0ae19345dd2","amp;dn":"Thomas+og+vennene+hans+-+Bl%26aring%3Bfjellmysteriet+-++Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c3736e2f3228ebce7327842d20b0ae19345dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,195,115,110,47,50,40,235,206,115,39,132,45,32,176,174,25,52,93,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
