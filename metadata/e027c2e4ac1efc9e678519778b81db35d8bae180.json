Here, the player will encounter numerous characters and many licensed cars ranging from Dodge Vipers to Lotus Exiges to Ford Transit vans fitted with F1 engines, all of which have full damage modelling, a shield bar which can be used at any time by the player to protect the player's car from other weapons, and separate traits such as Acceleration, Speed, Drift, Grip and Stability. Some special car models have been designed by Bizarre Creations themselves. There are also some heavily altered versions of familiar urban environments, such as the Los Angeles river halfpipe and several parts of London. These areas were altered to make the races more enjoyable instead of the developers having to strictly abide by each twist and turn. Depending on the character(s) the player races against or tags along with in team races, they will have their own racing styles, power-up set ups, match types, locales, cars and will be apart of certain fictional servers. As the player races well, performs stunts and uses power-ups in certain ways during races, the player will gain 'fan points', Blur's equivalent to PGR's Kudos system. These points help the player progress through the career, purchase more cars and parts and earn more fans for the user base. During the career, challenges will take place midrace when the player drives through a fan icon. Completing these short challenges (e.g. find a secret nitro power-up) will reward the player with a fan points boost.\n\n\n\n\n-=MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS=-\n===============================\n \n\nCPU: Intel  Pentium D Dual Core 3.4 GHz or Intel Core 2 E6300 or AMD Athlon 64 x2 3800+\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· RAM: 1gb xp / 2 GB vista-7\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· VIDEO CARD: 3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectX 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers:\n\n- All NVIDIA GeForce  6600 GT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding 8400 cards).  \n\n- All ATI Radeon 1600XT 256 MB RAM and better chipsets (excluding X1800 GTO, Radeon HD2400, Radeon HD2600, and Radeon HD3450)\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· SOUND CARD: 100% DirectX 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· HDD SPACE: 9 GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® swap file and 128 KB free for saved games)\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·OTHER: \n\n- 100% Windows VISTA or Windows 7-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers\n\n- 100% Windows VISTA or Windows 7-compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers**\n- INTERNET: Broadband connection and service required for Multiplayer Connectivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e027c2e4ac1efc9e678519778b81db35d8bae180","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+BLUR+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e027c2e4ac1efc9e678519778b81db35d8bae180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,39,194,228,172,30,252,158,103,133,25,119,139,129,219,53,216,186,225,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
