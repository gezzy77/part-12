In both the Director's and Extended Cut, Mike dies by being drowned in front of Salt while Orlov's men keep their guns aimed at her. According to Noyce's commentary, this scene would have earned an R rating for the movie and so was replaced by the scene of Mike's death shown in the theatrical version. Because of the increased violence, both the Extended Cut as well as the Director's Cut lost the PG-13 rating and became &quot;Unrated&quot;[2][3]. Furthermore, in each case the ending is different.\nIn the Extended Cut, Salt kills Orlov not on the barge near New York, but only at the end of the movie after escaping back to Russia, and she also destroys the ancient monastery where Orlov trained the children as spies.\nIn the Director's Cut, as Salt runs through the woods on her personal mission to hunt down other sleeper agents, the voiceover heard over the end of the film implies that the new US President is also one of Orlov's sleeper agents.\n\n-Special Features\n\t-SALT FilmmakerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Commentary (mp3)\n\t-The Ultimate Female Action Hero\n\t-Spy Disguise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Looks of Evelyn Salt\n\t-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe TreatmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (a radio interview with director Phillip Noyce) (mp3)\n-Salt DVD Covers\n-Salt Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n(track listing)\n- Prisoner Exchange\n- Escaping the CIA\n- Cornered\n- Orlov's Story\n- Chase Across DC\n- Attack On St. Bart's Cathedral\n- Hotel Room Preparations / Parade\n- A Dark Goddamn Hole\n- Taser Puppet\n- You Are My Greatest Creation\n- Destiny\n- Barge Apocalypse\n- Day X\n- I'm Going Home\n- Eight Floors Down\n- Arming the Football\n- Not Safe With Me\n- You're About to Become Famous\n- Mano a Mano\n- Garroted\n- Go Get Em\n\n-Salt Movie Stills\n-Salt Screenplay (pdf)\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the whole SALT 2010 DELUXE EXTENDED EDITON, with ALL THREE versions of the film WITH THE CORRECT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFORCEDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ENGLISH SUBTITLES burned into the rips for the Russian spoken parts of the film!

Out of the blue, a Russian spy walks into their offices and offers a vital piece of information: the President of Russia will be assassinated during his forthcoming visit to New York City to attend the funeral of the recently deceased U.S. Vice President. The name of the assassin: Evelyn Salt. Concerned about the safety of her husband, who she cannot contact, she goes on the run. Winter refuses to accept that she is a mole or a double agent but her actions begin to raise doubts. Just who is Evelyn Salt and what is she planning?\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER\nEvelyn Salt, a trusted and loyal CIA Operative, goes on the run when a Russian defector convinces her superiors that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a double agent sent to assassinate the President of the United States.\n\nCAST: Salt is a 2010 American spy action thriller film directed by Phillip Noyce, written by Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland\n- Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt/Natasha Chenkov, a CIA agent accused of being a double agent for the KGB.\n- Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter/Nikolai Darkovsky, the head of the fictional CIA's Russia House\n- Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody, a United States Counter-intelligence agent in pursuit of Salt\n- Daniel Olbrychski as Vassily Orlov, the Russian defector and spymaster\n- August Diehl as Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Krause, Salt's husband\n- Olek Krupa as Russian President Boris Matveyev\n- Hunt Block as United States President Howard Lewis\n- Corey Stoll as Shnaider, the Russian suicide-bomber sent to his death by Orlov\n\nMEMORABLE QUOTES:\nEvelyn Salt: What is your name? \nVassily Orlov: My name is Vassily Orlov. Today, a Russian agent will travel to New York city to kill the President. This agent is KA-12. \nEvelyn Salt: The KA program is a myth. \nVassily Orlov: Don't you want to know the name? \nEvelyn Salt: You're good. You can tell the rest of your story to one of my colleagues. \nVassily Orlov: Salt. \nEvelyn Salt: Yes? \nVassily Orlov: The name of the agent is Evelyn Salt. \nEvelyn Salt: My name is Evelyn Salt. \nVassily Orlov: Then you are a Russian spy.\n\nREVIEWS: \nKirk Honeycutt of the Hollywood Reporter said that, &quot;While preposterous at every turn, Salt is a better Bond movie than most recent Bond movies, as its makers keep the stunts real and severely limit CGI gimmickry&quot;\n Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars (his maximum), saying &quot;Salt is a damn fine thriller. ... It's gloriously absurd. This movie has holes in it big enough to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon.&quot;\n\nPLEASE SEED! No LEACHERS! This is nowhere on the net, with all three versions of the film, with the proper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œburned inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforcedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ English subs for the Russian speaking parts of the film, so youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll actually know what the hell is going on in the film, along with all the extras ripped from the DVD. \nHelp get this going!
