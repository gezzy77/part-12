I have also uploaded &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;).\n\n  Paul Newman plays the title role of the world-weary detective Lew Harper. Harper's personal life is a shambles, and his professional life isn't any better, and money making cases are rare. A job materializes via a lawyer friend. Harper finds a tie and one last clean shirt, and drives out of the city to a private estate of the very rich. And thus begins a bewildering tale of kidnapping, betrayal, murder, and complicated characters.\n\n  Starring: Paul Newman, Lauren Bacall, Arthur Hill, Janet Leigh, Robert Wagner, Strother Martin, Julie Harris, Shelley Winters, Pamela Tiffin.\n\n  Directed by: Jack Smight.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  2hr. 1min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  336\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10dc310f42a42533b72f53b8ae95dbcb4f0a8ed3","amp;dn":"Harper+%281966%29+%28Paul+Newman%2C+Lauren+Bacall%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10dc310f42a42533b72f53b8ae95dbcb4f0a8ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,220,49,15,66,164,37,51,183,47,83,184,174,149,219,203,79,10,142,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
