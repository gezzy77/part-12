The album was released May 1, 2007 on Columbia Nashville Records and was produced by Frank Liddell and Mike Wrucke. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was Lambert's first studio album released under the Columbia Nashville label, as 2005's Kerosene was issued on Epic Nashville Records. The album received high critical acclaim, with critics commenting on Lambert's revengeful material. The album went to number one on the United States' Top Country Albums chart and also reached #6 on the overall American chart. Out of the album's four singles, three were major hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart between 2007 and 2009. &quot;Gunpowder &amp; Lead,&quot; the third single released from the album, became her first Top 10 hit on the country chart in 2008. Other singles spawned from the album were, &quot;Famous in a Small Town,&quot; and &quot;More Like Her.&quot;\n\n-----","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd5a7a509b438e5313772cd601d458b0bc3d441","amp;dn":"Miranda+Lambert+-+Crazy+Ex-Girlfriend+%282007%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd5a7a509b438e5313772cd601d458b0bc3d441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,213,167,165,9,180,56,229,49,55,114,205,96,29,69,139,11,195,212,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
