Wells - George to his friends - arrives late to his own dinner party. He tells his guests of his travels in his time machine, the work about which his friends knew. They were also unbelieving, and skeptical of any practical use if it did indeed work. George knew that his machine was stationary in geographic position, but he did not account for changes in what happens over time to that location. He also learns that the machine is not impervious and he is not immune to those who do not understand him or the machine's purpose. George tells his friends that he did not find the Utopian society he so wished had developed. He mentions specifically a civilization several thousand years into the future which consists of the subterranean morlocks and the surface dwelling eloi, who on first glance lead a carefree life. Despite all these issues, love can still bloom over the spread of millennia.\n\nIMDB:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054387/\nWIKI:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 994 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nBit rate                         : 859 Kbps\nWidth                            : 592 pixels\nHeight                           : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.173\nStream size                      : 605 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 90.1 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\nLanguage                         : English\n\n[u][i][b]Please don't expect to get the movie in a few minutes, I only have limited bandwidth.
