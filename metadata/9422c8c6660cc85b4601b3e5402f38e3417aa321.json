According to Time, the legal medicinal cannabis economy already generates $200 million annually in taxable proceeds from a mere two hundred thousand registered medical users in just fourteen states.\nBut, thanks to Nixon and the War on Drugs, cannabis is still synonymous with heroin on the federal level even though it has won mainstream acceptance nationwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9422c8c6660cc85b4601b3e5402f38e3417aa321","amp;dn":"Too+High+to+Fail%3A+Cannabis+and+the+New+Green+Economic+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9422c8c6660cc85b4601b3e5402f38e3417aa321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,34,200,198,102,12,200,91,70,1,179,229,64,47,56,227,65,122,163,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
