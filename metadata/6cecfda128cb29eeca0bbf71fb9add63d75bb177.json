It works with the official game on Steam.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescriptions:\n-------------\n\nDawnguard:\nDawnguard revolves around an ancient prophecy predicted by an Elder Scroll. Foretelling the eternal obfuscation of the sun, the scroll gave instructions on how to perform a magic ritual with a mythic bow and a special blood sacrifice. A legion of vampires known as Clan Volkihar, lead by Lord Harkon, seek to actuate the prophecy by performing the ritual; the Dawnguard, a faction of crossbow-wielding vampire hunters counters their aims. Skyrim's Dragonborn protagonist chooses whether to join the Dawnguard and prevent Nirn for being plunged in irrevocable night, or assist the vampire coven with realizing their malevolent ambition.\n\nHearthfire:\nWith this official add-on to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, you can purchase land and build your own home from the ground up - from a simple one-room cottage to a sprawling compound complete with an armory, alchemy laboratory, stable, garden, and more. Use all-new tools like the drafting table and carpenter's workbench to transform quarried stone, clay, and sawn logs into structures and furnishings. Even transform your house into a home by adopting children.\n\nDragonborn:\nEncounter new towns, dungeons, and quests, as you traverse the ash wastes and glacial valleys of this new land. Become more powerful with shouts that bend the will of your enemies and even tame dragons. Your fate, and the fate of Solstheim, hangs in the balance as you face off against your deadliest adversary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first Dragonborn.\n\n(Source: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to install:\n\n-Extract the archive\n-Copy and paste contents into your directory Skyrim folder (Default: C:/Program files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/skyrim/data)\n-Launch Skyrim\n-Enjoy !\n\n/!
