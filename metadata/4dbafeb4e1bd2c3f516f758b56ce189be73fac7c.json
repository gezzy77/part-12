A spin-off from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, each story was introduced by Freddy Krueger (played, as in the movies, by Robert Englund). This format is essentially the same as that employed by Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone. The pilot episode was directed by Tobe Hooper, and begins with Freddy Krueger&amp;#039;s acquittal of the child-murdering charges due to his officer&amp;#039;s lack of reviewing the Miranda warning at the time of Freddy&amp;#039;s arrest. A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant (his workplace), leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\nSeason Two \n\n23  1 Dream Come True October 8, 1989\n24 2 Heartbreak Hotel October 15, 1989\n25 3 Welcome to Springwood October 22, 1989\n26 4 Photo Finish October 29, 1989\n27 5 Memory Overload November 5, 1989\n28 6 Lucky Stiff November 12, 1989\n29 7 Silence Is Golden November 19, 1989\n30 8 Bloodlines November 26, 1989\n31 9 Monkey Dreams December 3, 1989\n32 10 Do You Know Where Your Kids Are?
