The Boys Are Back In Town\n\n2011\n\n\n\nCD / 2011 / 320Kbps\n\n\nThin Lizzy fans are long familiar with the video portion of this show.  For anyone not familiar, this show captures Thin Lizzy on one of the final dates of their Live &amp; Dangerous tour, playing a free show on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. The show took place on October 29, 1978.\n\nThis is one of the more short-lived lineups of the band. Gary Moore had stepped in for Brian Robertson (who had a final falling out with Phil Lynott) and drummer Mark Nauseef, from Ian Gillan's solo band, was filling in for Brian Downey (who had taken leave of the band citing exhaustion).\n\nThe challenge with this disc is that the audio is a straight run-down of the DVD audio, which had muffled, almost bootleg-quality sound. As this was a pro-shot concert (not a bootleg), the guess is that the camera mic was the source of the audio and it overloaded. The other challenge with the audio is that the disc was recorded TAO so there are gaps between the tracks. The sound quality does waver a bit throughout.\n\n \n\n Tracklist:\n\n1\t\tJailbreak \n\t\n2\t\tBad Reputation\n \t\n3\t\tCowboy Song\n \t\n4\t\tThe Boys Are Back In Town / Waiting For An Alibi\n \t\n5\t\tAre You Ready \n\t\n6\t\tMe And The Boys\t\n\n7\t\tBaby Drive Me Crazy \n\n\t\n\nPersonnel:\n\nPhil Lynott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, bass\n\nGary Moore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, backing vocals\n\nScott Gorham Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, backing vocals\n\nMark Nauseef Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe sound quality may scare off the casual fan. (LOL)\n\nAnyway, one for the boys.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ab9cb48931f5d45bfbf063763f16570b207a81","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+feat.+Gary+Moore+-+Live%2C+Sydney%2C+Australia%2C+1978","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ab9cb48931f5d45bfbf063763f16570b207a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,171,156,180,137,49,245,212,91,251,240,99,118,63,22,87,11,32,122,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
