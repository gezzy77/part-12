Unlike other books that focus on the intersection of design and technology, Above the Fold explores the relationship between the stakeholders of a Web project-- the designer, the user and the client -- and how this continuous cycle affects the decisions made by successful Web designers. Above the Fold is not technical manual or a how-to book, nor is it about timely trends; it's about the timeless fundamentals of layout, usability and measurement that lead to a successful digital product.\n\n\nBy Brian Miller\nPublished by HOW Books in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde4128fb8a78f76bbec605e76b4613025ffe6c9","amp;dn":"Above+the+Fold+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde4128fb8a78f76bbec605e76b4613025ffe6c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,228,18,143,184,167,143,118,187,236,96,94,118,180,97,48,37,255,230,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
