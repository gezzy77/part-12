It has the dark, drug rock feel of an early to mid career Spiritualized record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organs and all! However, it never feels too heavy or bogged down. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite the opposite; with uplifting vocals, chord progressions, and strings, as heard on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Dream of CrystalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, it is connotative to that of the polyphonic spree in itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many moments of glee and ecstasy. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as if James Chapman, the man behind Maps, is killing himself in his pursuit of happiness; there is even a track entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDie Happy Die SmilingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. There are intense minimalist moments, such as the opening of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that make me want to cry like a Muse song sometimes makes me want to cry; but then Maps drops a nice beat with plenty of interesting, and sometimes dirty, synths to make me feel like dancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and maybe crying and laughing too.\nSo many emotions come and go as I listen to Turning the Mind, but boredom is never one of them. It is a very cohesive work, which I never found any tracks that are there just as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfluffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfillersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in. The project has conquered one very big quality that I look for in music: two opposing sounds working synergistically to create something familiar yet so new that you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite put your finger on why you love it so much. Turning the Mind is both dark and uplifting. It leaves me feeling warm with a tinge of cold shudders, like I just got home safely from a long, harrowing journey. This is an LP full of gems that I definitely recommend digging up.\n\nThe Guardian review:\nJames Chapman, aka Maps, seems to have taken the old Spacemen 3 slogan &quot;Taking drugs to make music to take drugs to&quot; as a motto. The follow-up to 2007's blissful We Can Create documents the effects of stimulants on the human brain. He claims to have done &quot;a lot of research&quot; in this process, which may mean he spent the first album's proceeds getting wasted. He hasn't been wasting his time, though, and Turning the Mind heralds a new Maps sound. In come synthesisers for guitars; there are nods to the dancefloor, angrier lyrics about &quot;cocaine fury&quot; replace melancholia and a general loss of innocence. This is all showcased to best effect on Let Go of the Fear and the Flaming Lips-like I Dream of Crystal. However, at times, Chapman's whispery vocals could benefit from a magic potion of their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8339ba6617c44facaebd0a63778016aa63bd65f0","amp;dn":"Maps+-+Turning+The+Mind+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8339ba6617c44facaebd0a63778016aa63bd65f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,57,186,102,23,196,79,172,174,189,10,99,119,128,22,170,99,189,101,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
