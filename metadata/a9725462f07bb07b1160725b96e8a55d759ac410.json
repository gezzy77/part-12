Track 11 appears to be an alternate camera shot from the same taping of track 6 and with alternate non-SBD audio source.\n\nDisc Two Notes: The highlight of both of these discs is Track 10 of Disc Two where Stevie and Lonnie play Wham together. Stevie fans will recognize that this is Stevie playing with his mentor the very first song that Stevie learned to play and the very first record that Stevie ever bought. Recall that Stevie played Wham so many times as a kid and so loudly in his bedroom that his Dad got mad and broke the record more than once, forcing Stevie to just go out and buy another copy and repeat the process over and over.\n\n\nThe repeated tracks are alternate camera angles of what appears to me to be the same take of each respective song that appears earlier on either of the discs. Track 7 cuts out and track 8 cuts in. Tracks 1 through 7 have an alternate non-SBD audio source. From Track 8 on, there is a &quot;For Preview Only&quot; subtitle posted across the bottom of the screen. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9725462f07bb07b1160725b96e8a55d759ac410","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+%26+Lonnie+Mack+-+American+Caravan+%281986%29+%5B2xDV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9725462f07bb07b1160725b96e8a55d759ac410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,114,84,98,240,123,176,123,17,96,114,91,150,232,165,93,117,154,196,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
