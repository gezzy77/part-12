He was the son of an American arms manufacturer who moved in the confidence of world leaders, not simply witnessing events but often propelling them. The protagonist has been characterized as the antithesis of the &quot;Ugly American&quot;, a sophisticated socialite who mingles easily with people from all cultures and socioeconomic classes.\r\n\r\nThe series covers in sequence much of the political history of the Western world, particularly Europe and America, in the first half of the twentieth century. Out of print and almost totally forgotten today (until these ebook releases), the novels were all bestsellers and were published in twenty-one countries. The third book in the series, Dragon's Teeth, won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1943.\r\n\r\nWhile Sinclair's socialist views and belief in seances are evident, his presentation of the history, events and key players is accurate, first rate and thorougly engrossing.\r\n\r\nThe Lanny Budd Series:\r\n\r\n#01\tWORLD'S END - Published 1940, 740 pages\r\n\tWorld War I and immediately after.\r\n\r\n#02\tBETWEEN TWO WORLDS - Published 1941, 859 pages\r\n\tFrom the Treaty of Versailles (1919) to the crash of 1929.\r\n\r\n#03\tDRAGON'S TEETH - Published 1942, 631 pages (Pulitzer Prize winner)\r\n\t1929 to 1934 - the Nazis' rise to power.\r\n\r\n#04\tWIDE IS THE GATE - Published 1943, 751 pages\r\n\t1934 to 1938 - the Nazi blood purge and the Spanish Civil War.\r\n\r\n#05\tPRESIDENTIAL AGENT - Published 1944, 655 pages\r\n\t1938 - the appeasement period.\r\n\r\n#06\tDRAGON HARVEST - Published 1945, 703 pages\r\n\tFrom Munich to the German occupation of Paris.\r\n\r\n#07\tA WORLD TO WIN - Published 1946, 627 pages\r\n\tVichy - 1940 to 1942.\r\n\r\n#08\tPRESIDENTIAL MISSION - Published 1947, 645 pages\r\n\t1942 to 1943 - invasion of Africa and behind the scenes in wartime Germany.\r\n\r\n#09\tONE CLEAR CALL - Published 1948, 629 pages\r\n\t1943 &amp; 1944 - Sicily, Italy, France: D-Day to Roosevelt's re-election.\r\n\r\n#10\tO SHEPHERD, SPEAK! - Published 1949, 629 pages\r\n\t1944~46 - Battle of the Bulge, Yalta, Roosevelt's death, A-bomb, Nuremberg.\r\n\r\n#11\tTHE RETURN OF LANNY BUDD - Published 1953, 555 pages\r\n\tThe cold war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65a132699e4bf0861431e2689099f5c075c8289","amp;dn":"Upton+Sinclair%27s+Complete+Lanny+Budd+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65a132699e4bf0861431e2689099f5c075c8289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,90,19,38,153,228,191,8,97,67,30,38,137,9,159,92,7,92,130,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
