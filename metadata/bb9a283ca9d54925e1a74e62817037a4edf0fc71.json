I.G.Y.\n2. Green Flower Street\n3. Ruby Baby\n4. Maxine\n5. New Frontier\n6. The Nightfly\n7. The Goodbye Look\n8. Walk Between Raindrops\n\n\nThe Nightfly is one of the greatest albums of all time. It brings the jazz/blues sound to the forefront, and takes it a step further. It also is a concept album: the songs represent certain fantasies that might of been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a northeastern city during the late fifties and early sixties. And the sound is an homage to those years. The great musicians and Fagen's unique vocals and crooning style create a timeless work that is as fresh today as it was the day it was recorded. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 25\nArtist: Donald Fagen\nAlbum: The Nightfly\nYear: 1982\nGenre: Jazz/Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9a283ca9d54925e1a74e62817037a4edf0fc71","amp;dn":"Donald+Fagen+-+The+Nightfly+%5BFLAC-1982%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9a283ca9d54925e1a74e62817037a4edf0fc71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,154,40,60,169,213,73,37,225,167,78,98,129,112,55,164,237,240,252,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
