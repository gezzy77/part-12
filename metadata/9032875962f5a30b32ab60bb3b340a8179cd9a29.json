MacFarlane voices the beloved animated character of Hayley \nSmith on the Emmy nominated television show, American Dad!, currently in its \nseventh season. The 14-track playlist is inspired by music from the 60s and \n70s. &quot;When I was growing up, my dad introduced me to groups like Simon and \nGarfunkel and The Beatles and Crosby, Stills and Nash. So we decided to run \nwith the idea of re-imagining music from my childhood, which would be \nappropriate for Hayley to sing. Two of the album s fourteen songs will be \nincluded on that season-opening episode of American Dad!. First is Someone \nto Watch Over Me, which introduces Hayley s vocal skills. It s a song I ve \nbeen singing since high school, says MacFarlane, We wanted to strip it down \nand create a quiet, introspective version with the small group. Second is \nMakin Whoopee, the album opener. The show s producers, says MacFarlane, \nwere going for a Fabulous Baker Boys feel, which was perfect for the \nstoryline. Out of This World, is also on the album. The classic Harold \nArlen/Johnny Mercer song is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that Hayley is \nbecoming romantically involved with an alien, and would be a great addition \nto a future episode s soundtrack. A few additional standards found their way \nonto the album. I m Glad There Is You is, says MacFarlane, my father s \nfavorite. It is really stripped down just me with George Doering on guitar and \nit s a love letter to all the musicians, and everyone else, who made [the \nalbum] possible. The remaining tracks are all drawn from the 1960s and 70s. \nPaul Simon s Feelin Groovy , Tedd Firth of the Chiffons 1963 hit, One Fine \nDay, written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. A second Goffin-King \ncomposition, Up On the Roof, also made the cut. To close the album, \nMacFarlane chose Lennon and McCartney s All My Loving, arranged and \nconducted by Matt Catingub with just Doering s guitar and a bank of strings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9032875962f5a30b32ab60bb3b340a8179cd9a29","amp;dn":"Rachael+MacFarlane+-+Hayley+Sings+%5B256+cbr%5D+2012+%28Family+Guy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9032875962f5a30b32ab60bb3b340a8179cd9a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,50,135,89,98,245,163,11,50,171,96,187,59,52,10,129,121,205,154,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
