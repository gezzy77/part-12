Drummer Greg Upchurch jumped ship to join 3 Doors Down while guitarist Paul \n          Phillips chose to follow his muse with new-to-the-scenesters Operator. POM founder   \n          Wes Scantlin (vocals, guitar) and longtime bassist Doug Ardito keep the Mudd sound   \n          intact here, though, moving a bit from the early nu-metal stylings to a more natural \n          comfort zone of raunchy post-alt rock. The solid collection of songs on FAMOUS       \n          flaunts track after track of made-for-radio anthems, with Scantlin channeling Kurt   \n          Cobain's sneer as it communes with Layne Staley's predilection for sinister-sounding \n          vocal harmonies.                                                                     \n                                                                                               \n          Puddle of Mudd: Douglas Ardito (vocals, guitar, bass guitar); Christian Stone        \n          (vocals, guitar); Wesley Scantlin (vocals, guitar synthesizer); Ryan Yerdon (drums). \n                                                                                               \n          Additional personnel: Tim Pierce (guitar, electric guitar); Duane Betts, Lee Miles,  \n          Andrew Berlin, Christopher Jak (guitar); Brian Howes (guitars); Tony Fagenson        \n          (acoustic guitar, electric guitar, piano, keyboards, bass guitar, percussion,        \n          programming, background vocals); Max Collins (acoustic guitar); Xandy Barry (electric\n          guitar); Tony Battaglia (gut-string guitar); Howard Benson, Jamie Muhoberac          \n          (keyboards, programming); Abe Laboriel, Jr. (drums, percussion); Mark Pontius, Josh  \n          Freese, Kenny Aronoff (drums); Lenny Castro (percussion); Gabe Witcher (background   \n          vocals).                                                                             \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Famous                      [03:16]                                        \n                 02.Livin' on borrowed time     [03:01]                                        \n                 03.It was faith                [03:32]                                        \n                 04.Psycho                      [03:31]                                        \n                 05.We don't have to look back  [03:42]                                        \n                    now                                                                        \n                 06.Moonshine                   [04:07]                                        \n                 07.Thinking about you          [03:42]                                        \n                 08.Merry-Go-round              [02:42]                                        \n                 09.I'm so sure                 [04:33]                                        \n                 10.Radiate                     [03:13]                                        \n                 11.If I could love you         [03:11]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               38:30 min                                       \n                                                63,1 MB               \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed8a802091fe5757eadc4f7cb5448064bffbd96","amp;dn":"Puddle_Of_Mudd-Famous-%28Retail%29-2007-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed8a802091fe5757eadc4f7cb5448064bffbd96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,216,168,2,9,31,229,117,126,173,196,247,203,84,72,6,75,255,189,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
