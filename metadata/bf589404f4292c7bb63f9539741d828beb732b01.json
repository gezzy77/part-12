These interpretations (as many others of the same pianist) are just perfect. \n\nI had the great luck to listen to Brendel in Rome some years ago, he played Schubert and for me it was like what happened with Beethoven: I rediscovered these extraordinary composers. Brendel makes you appreciate the sensitivity of each artist he approaches. \n\nYou cannot miss him. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf589404f4292c7bb63f9539741d828beb732b01","amp;dn":"Franz+Schubert+-+The+Piano+Works+%28Alfred+Brendel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf589404f4292c7bb63f9539741d828beb732b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,88,148,4,244,41,44,123,182,63,149,57,116,29,130,139,235,115,43,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
