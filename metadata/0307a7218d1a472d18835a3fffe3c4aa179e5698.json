Influences range from house to low-slung, fuzzed up punk garage, and seminal 80\\&amp;#039;s raincoat-wearing Mancunian electro-pop to nouveau disco, often within one song. Impossible to pigeonhole. Pop and dance. Happy sad. Simple yet complicated. Sincere yet cool. Naive but clever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0307a7218d1a472d18835a3fffe3c4aa179e5698","amp;dn":"Cut+Copy+-+Bright+Like+Neon+Love+%282004%29+%5BLAME+VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0307a7218d1a472d18835a3fffe3c4aa179e5698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,7,167,33,141,26,71,45,24,131,90,63,255,227,196,170,23,158,86,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
