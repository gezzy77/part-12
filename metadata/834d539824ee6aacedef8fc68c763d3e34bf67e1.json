Based on the supernatural horror \ncomic book series created by Top Cow Productions, Inc., The Darkness II breaks out of the sea of \nconventional first-person shooters with its fervid Quad-Wielding gameplay, which will allow players \nto slash, grab, and throw objects and enemies with their Demon Arms while simultaneously firing two \nweapons. \n\nThe game is layered with the use of dark versus light, steeped in deep and twisted storytelling, \nand engulfed in stylistic violence that is visualized through a hand-paintedgraphic noir technique that \nstays true to its comic book origins. It s been two years since JackieEstacado, now the Don of the \nFranchetti crime family, used The Darkness to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend s murder. \nHe s been unable to shake the memory of Jenny s death since bottling up his supernatural power, and \nnow The Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie s life heralds the start of a full\nscale mob war, which has clearly been orchestrated by some outside force. The botched attempt opens \nthe door for The Darkness to reemerge, and sets Jackie on a journey to hell and worse, as he unravels \nthe mystery behind the attack and the motivations of The Darkness itself. \n \nPlatform: Xbox 360 \nRegion: Region Free\nFormat XGD3 (LT2.0 or above)\nSize: 1DVD\nLanguage: English\nGenre: Shooter\n\nTrailer:\n\nXGD3 BURN GUIDE: http://nickthegr33k.eu/XGD3burn.pdf\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:834d539824ee6aacedef8fc68c763d3e34bf67e1","amp;dn":"The+Darkness+2+RF+XBOX360-XPG+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"834d539824ee6aacedef8fc68c763d3e34bf67e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,77,83,152,36,238,106,172,237,239,143,198,140,118,61,62,52,191,103,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
