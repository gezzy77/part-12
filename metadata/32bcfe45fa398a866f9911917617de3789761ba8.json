Between 1600 and 1800, this entire world-view was shattered by revolutionary new ideas - that consenting adults have the freedom to do what they like with their own bodies, and morality cannot be imposed by force. This groundbreaking book shows that the creation of this modern culture of sex - broadcasted and debated in a rapidly expanding universe of public media - was a central part of the Enlightenment, and helped create a new model of western civilization whose principles of equality, privacy and individual freedom last to this day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32bcfe45fa398a866f9911917617de3789761ba8","amp;dn":"The+Origins+of+Sex_A+History+of+the+First+Sexual+Revolution+-Dab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32bcfe45fa398a866f9911917617de3789761ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,188,254,69,250,57,138,134,111,153,17,145,118,23,222,55,137,118,27,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
