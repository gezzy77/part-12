Happy New Year !!!\n\nMade in Ukraine\n\n\nThanks,\nand reed more at http://iBrain.com.ua\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nspeed 2mb/s\n\nThis is updated App from\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4476354/640_iPhone_iPod_Touch_Applications_(iBrain_Pack)_ipa\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFusionX Manual\n\nHow to install those custom applications:\n\n1. Install OpenSSH through Cydia...\n\n*******************************************************************************\nI'd also install the 'SSH toggler button' avaiable in the Cydia packaging. \nSSH remains on by default even after you are done using it. SSH can drain \na lot of battery, so you want to disable it when you are finished!!! \n*******************************************************************************\n\n2. Enable WIFI on your iPhone, log into your network, and write down its IP address\n3. Open CUTE FTP.... and set it up as SFTP on SSH2\n4. Put in your iPhone's IP address\n5. Put in your iPhone's credentials - username: root\tpassword: alpine\n6. Create a folder called Documents in /var/mobile/ and set permission to 777\n7. Create a folder called Documents in the /Applications folder and set permissions to 777. \nThis will fix the Disk Full error message seen when launching certain games\nNote: You will only need to create these two Documents folders onceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢\n\n8. Go to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileInstallation.framework\n9. Rename the file MobileInstallation to MobileInstallation.bak\n10. Locate the patched MobileInstallation file inside this release\nNote: The MobileInstallation file works for both v2.1 and v2.2 firmware!\n\n11. Place the patched file into the /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileInstallation.framework folder and set the permissions 775 for the patched MobileInstallation file\n12. Reboot your iPhone\n13. Download at least one App from Apple App Store and sync it (Free or Paid) \nIMPORTANT: Otherwise you will get an error! [Only need to do this once]\n\n14. Now you can download cracked .ipa Games and Apps \n15. Double click on the cracked .ipa you downloaded for it to show up in the iTunes applications\n16. Sync your iPhone/iPod Touch and enjoy\n\nIMPORTANT: Remember to turn off SSH when done [stays on by default and drains battery]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081799feea474eafa9e9e80c602df12a9df9e3aa","amp;dn":"808+iPhone%2FiPod+Touch+Applications+%2F+X-Mas+iBrain+Pack+%2F+ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081799feea474eafa9e9e80c602df12a9df9e3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,23,153,254,234,71,78,175,169,233,232,12,96,45,241,42,157,249,227,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
