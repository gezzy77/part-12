Now that story comes to its full terrible life in this gripping account by the bestselling historian Norman Davies.\n\nIn August 1944, encouraged by the advance of the Red Army, the Polish Resistance poured forty thousand fighters into the streets of Warsaw to reclaim the city from the hated Germans. But Stalin condemned the uprising as a criminal venture. For sixty-three days the Wehrmacht methodically set about crushing the rebellion and destroying the city. Following the battleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desperate progress through the cellars and sewers of Warsaw, Rising Ã¢â‚¬â„¢44 retrieves its subject from the shadows of history, revealing its pivotal importance to the outcome of World War II and the Cold War that followed.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nThe Warsaw rising of 1944Ã¢â‚¬â€not to be confused with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943Ã¢â‚¬â€pitted Polish insurgents of the Home Army against the Germans in a two-month battle that left the city in ruins. Almost as bitter are the historiographical controversies over the failure of the Allies, particularly the Soviets, whose army was idling nearby, to rescue the city. Davies (Europe: A History) offers an enthralling, impressionistic account of the uprising, highlighted by vivid reminiscences from Polish and German participants, but the bulk of this sprawling book is concerned with the political background and aftermath. Delving into the diplomatic wranglings between the exiled Polish government in London, the Western Allies and Stalin, Davies sides with the anti-Communist interpretation of the episode as the opening chapter in the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe. He denounces Stalin for deliberately allowing the non-Communist Home Army to be crushed, the Western Allies for acquiescing and British intellectuals for toeing the Communist line on Poland, and includes a pointed litany of Stalinist crimes in post-war Poland. Davies is correspondingly enthusiastic about the insurgents. He exonerates them of charges of anti-Semitism, reprints poems and songs about them and, working from iffy figures on German casualties, extols their combat prowess. Davies is persuasive on many points, and his somewhat romantic defense of the risingÃ¢â‚¬â€which failed in its objectives and triggered the German massacre of tens of thousands of civiliansÃ¢â‚¬â€amply conveys its heroism, but may not convince readers of its wisdom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793a9c6589abc76c4316770dba763eed2a39cb97","amp;dn":"Rising+%2744%3A+The+Battle+for+Warsaw+by+Norman+Davies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793a9c6589abc76c4316770dba763eed2a39cb97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,58,156,101,137,171,199,108,67,22,119,13,186,118,62,237,42,57,203,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
