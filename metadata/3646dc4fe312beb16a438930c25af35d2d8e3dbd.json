She has an amazing family, an invigorating job straight out of college, and a boyfriend she adores. Then a phone call changes everything. Her father, a successful businessman, a man she has always trusted and admired, is in trouble with the law. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s innocent, he insists to his family, but the only way out, is this: his testimony against his accomplices and the immediate placement of his family deep inside the Witness Protection Program. He accepts, and everyone prepares to go into hidingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½until one of them suddenly gets cold feet. In a flash, KateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perfect life is gone. \n\nNow, a year later, her worst fears have happened. KateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father suddenly disappearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into what the WITSEC agency calls the Blue ZoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and someone very important to him is found brutally murdered. As Kate digs into her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, the shocking truth she finds sets in motion a decades-old vendetta. With her family under watch, with the FBI untrustworthy, and her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s menacing &quot;friends&quot; circling her with increasing intensity, Kate alone must set off on the life and death journey to find her father, and uncover the secrets someone will kill to keep buried. \n\nWith the breakneck pacing of James Patterson, the storytelling twists of Harlan Coben and the emotional resonance of Tami Hoag. Andrew Gross stakes out his own terrain as a new modern master of suspense. \n____________________________________________________________\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n  Having coauthored five bestsellers with James Patterson (Lifeguard, etc.), Gross makes a solo debut superior to his collaborative efforts, if short of the first thriller rank. His engaging heroine, Kate Raab, a medical researcher in the Bronx, is shocked when the Feds arrest her beloved gold trader father, Benjamin, and charge him with laundering money for a Colombian drug cartel. A hit team's attempt to kill the entire Raab family prompts all of them, except Kate, to start their lives anew in the witness protection program. Kate's choice, predictably, places her in continuing danger, even as she begins to suspect that her father's involvement with the narco traffickers was more deliberate and extensive than he's willing to admit. The secret revelations at the heart of the plot may strike some as a little far-fetched, and the details about the witness protection program fail to convince, but Gross shows sufficient talent for readers to want to see more from his pen alone.\n\n  &quot;Gross makes a solo debut superior to his collaborative efforts...[He] shows sufficient talent for readers to want to see more from his pen alone.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\n  &quot;Gross offers much that will please: an intriguing premise, shocking twists, a gripping plot, and a sympathetic female lead who faces heartrending dilemmas as she grapples with the truth. Highly recommended.&quot; -- Library Journal\n\n  &quot;Real fear, real thrills, real suspense ... real good.&quot; -- Lee Child, author of The Hard Way\n\n  &quot;THE BLUE ZONE is a tense and chilling thriller with a whole lot of heart.&quot; -- James Patterson \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3646dc4fe312beb16a438930c25af35d2d8e3dbd","amp;dn":"THE+BLUE+ZONE+-+Andrew+Gross.+Read+by+Ilyana+Kadushin+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3646dc4fe312beb16a438930c25af35d2d8e3dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,70,220,79,227,18,190,177,106,67,137,48,194,90,243,93,45,142,61,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
