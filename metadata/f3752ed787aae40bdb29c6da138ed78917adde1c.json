Adams\nNational stardom for The Fleetwoods exactly paralleled my own high school career, 1959-62. The two girls and the guy, Gretchen, Barbara and Gary, started their vocal trio when seniors themselves in '58. It was a more innocent time, at least as concerns teen and young adult love relationships. There was no birth control pill, sex before marriage was risky and firmly discouraged, alcohol and tobacco were the only drugs anyone had experience with. Cohabitation was unheard of, divorce was disreputable, STD's only happened to people you did not care to know. Elvis was the musical &quot;bad boy&quot; of the era, if those born after 1960 can imagine that. \n\nThe Fleetwoods had two great hits, &quot;Come Softly To Me&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blue&quot;. They are ballads of love found and love lost, and all the other 25 or so numbers on this CD fit inbetween them. As a freshman, I liked the two hits, but I spent my music budget on Buddy Holly and the Kingston Trio. Now, rapidly approaching something called retirement age, I can afford to have that Fleetwoods album I almost bought for $2.98 in 1960. I thought it might be too bland even for me, but I discovered that this collection is a great stress-reliever, and holds up well when played repeatedly. The harmonies are wonderful, and some fine songs are included. \n\nThe trio's version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; is done without accompaniment, to powerful effect. &quot;Skylark&quot; and &quot;Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Lavender Blue&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; were hits for others, and are done well here. &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot; and &quot;What'll I Do&quot; are wonderful. The Fleetwoods were pop balladeers in the golden age of rock 'n roll, but they never lost their youthful attitude toward these mostly mellow works. \n\nBefore Vietnam, or hippies, or pot, or political assassinations, we had dates, proms, graduations, love that worked and love that failed. The Fleetwoods were worthy of their fame, and if you think they are uncool, your musical taste is just too narrow.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nFleetwoods, The - Come Softly to Me: The Very Best of the Fleetwoods\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Fleetwoods, The\nAlbum................: Come Softly to Me: The Very Best of the Fleetwoods\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 232kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
