Steve Earle's I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive.  Steve Earle is a rock/Texas country musician who recently has been a character on HBO's The Wire and Treme.  As for the book itself it should come as no surprise that it involves substance abuse and seedy areas.  As wikipedia describes it:\n\nThe novel is set in San Antonio in 1963, and tells the story of a defrocked doctor and morphine addict. The doctor makes a living by performing illegal abortions and is haunted by the ghost of Hank Williams, with whom he was traveling when Williams died of an overdose.\n\nI just finished reading it and I would definitely recommend it for any fans of the wire as well as casual fans.  A very cool read.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81dd4a2544841d87340964aa9871acce3d26c1ac","amp;dn":"Steve+Earle+-+I%5C%27ll+Never+Get+Out+of+This+World+Alive.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81dd4a2544841d87340964aa9871acce3d26c1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,221,74,37,68,132,29,135,52,9,100,170,152,113,172,206,61,38,193,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
