I find his work relevant and useful for seeking an examined life, one of abundance, amazement, and awe. What one achieves (on occasions, at least) are moments full of sublime and true joy/contentment/happiness. I appreciate Tolle's suggestion that these portals are for the taking, not to be &quot;learned&quot; or &quot;studied&quot; or &quot;mastered&quot;, but practiced and exercised right now, right here, wherever you are in your journey. I see Tolle as not a worshiped enlightened guru or spiritual master, but simply a teacher, nothing more, nothing less. Great stuff, this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52fd59fb13bbf6dfd1e53584d2e2c3662d989e2","amp;dn":"Entering+the+Now+by+Eckhart+tolle+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52fd59fb13bbf6dfd1e53584d2e2c3662d989e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,47,213,159,177,59,191,109,253,30,83,88,77,46,44,54,98,217,137,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
