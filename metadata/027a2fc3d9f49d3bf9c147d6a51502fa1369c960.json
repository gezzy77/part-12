Forget about the higher price and the fact that 40 songs might seem to be more Drifters than most casual listeners would want -- All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More: 1959-1965 is a towering and magnificent collection of some of the best popular R&amp;B ever done this side of Sam Cooke. And, as with Sam Cooke, the beautiful part of the Drifters&amp;#039; work during this period is that any look beyond and behind their hits reveals a lot more songs that were every bit as good as those hits. There&amp;#039;s not even a slightly weak track anywhere on All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More, which contains the biggest hits Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, and Johnny Moore sang for the group. &quot;There Goes My Baby,&quot; &quot;This Magic Moment,&quot; &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; &quot;Sweets for My Sweet,&quot; &quot;I Count the Tears,&quot; &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot; &quot;On Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; are all here, mastered in surprisingly good sound for the late &amp;#039;80s. There&amp;#039;s a lot more than that, however -- the producers have also included killer B-sides (such as &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;) that hadn&amp;#039;t been in print since the mid-&amp;#039;60s, and they&amp;#039;ve dug even deeper to throw in finished tracks that were left in the vaults until the &amp;#039;70s. The notes by Colin Escott are an added bonus, displaying his usual command for historical detail. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nCD 1\n\n                                                     \n01.
