He wants them to box each other. They agree as long as the winner gets a shot at the middleweight title. They enlist Grace, Cesar's current and Vinnie's ex girlfriend, to drive them to Vegas. On the trip, we see flashbacks to their previous title shots, their competitive friendship, and Grace's motivational wiles. (She has her own entrepreneurial dreams.) The fight itself is historic: ten rounds of savagery and courage. Who will win, who'll get the title shot, who gets Grace, and where will she find venture capital?\n\n\nRelease date ...: June 2011                             \nTheater Date....: $3,366 (USA) (26 December 1999) (1 Screen)\nDuration .......: 2:03:57\nVideo Format ...: x264                                 \nVideo Bitrate ..: 4800kbps                     \nResolution .....: 1280x544    \nFrame Rate .....: 23.976fps                  \n\nAudio 1 : Russian Dub\nAudio 2 : English DTS 2 Ch 1510 kbps\n                           \nSubs ...........: N/A                               \nSource .........: Blu-Ray Region A Retail         \nGenre ..........: Comedy | Drama | Sport        \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c820fb8917f1e9335c69d55c44aaf481b2a1b4","amp;dn":"Play.It.To.The.Bone.1999.720p.BluRay.x264-NODLABS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c820fb8917f1e9335c69d55c44aaf481b2a1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,200,32,251,137,23,241,233,51,92,105,213,92,68,170,244,129,178,161,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
