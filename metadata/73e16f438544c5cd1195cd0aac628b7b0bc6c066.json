I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at the show so I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t confirm how much of the information I read was true, but apparently there was fire, baseball bats and plenty of violence involved which resulted in the 3 main bands not being able to play. This year, 2 of the members of King 810 were arrested on assault charges when trying to enter the UK to play Download Festival. The charges were dismissed for one of the members and the other put on bail (with travel allowed). Next thing I hear they are signed to Roadrunner Records and are releasing a new album called Ã¢â‚¬ËœMemoirs of a MurdererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. A bunch of nutcases? or clever marketing? Probably a bit of both. So it seems they can talk the talk but can the music back it up?\n\nUnusually for the style of music this album is a concept piece, though apparently non-fictional, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMemoirs of a MurdererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a memoir of the life of King 810 frontman David Gunn set to the backdrop of Flint, MI. It includes a couple of sections of spoken word material to go with the songs and is divided into three sections: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ViolenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ArtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.King 810 - Memoirs Of A Murderer  mp3  320k   2014 What we got....     \t11.88 MB\n  \t\t16 - State Of Nature.mp3 \t11.64 MB\n  \t\t03 - Murder Murder Murder.mp3 \t11.26 MB\n  \t\t10 - Boogeyman.mp3 \t10.86 MB\n  \t\t13 - Carve My Name.mp3 \t10.79 MB\n  \t\t09 - Desperate Lovers.mp3 \t10.41 MB\n  \t\t07 - Anatomy 12.mp3 \t10.32 MB\n  \t\t08 - Eyes.mp3 \t10.04 MB\n  \t\t11 - Devil Don't Cry.mp3 \t9.76 MB\n  \t\t14 - War Outside.mp3 \t9.63 MB\n  \t\t15 - Write About Us.mp3 \t9.16 MB\n  \t\t05 - Fat Around The Heart.mp3 \t8.89 MB\n  \t\t06 - Treading And Trodden.mp3 \t8.78 MB\n  \t\t01 - Killem All.mp3 \t8.2 MB\n  \t\t04 - Take It.mp3 \t8.04 MB\n  \t\t02 - Best Nite Of My Life.mp3 \t7.88 MB\nThis is the Shit it what people have been waiting for and For a tour and the time to support the music Its gonna be King 810 Slipknot and KoRn Touring so thats when your chance is  Go to those shows and support your music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73e16f438544c5cd1195cd0aac628b7b0bc6c066","amp;dn":"King+810+-+Memoirs+Of+A+Murderer++mp3++320k+++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73e16f438544c5cd1195cd0aac628b7b0bc6c066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,225,111,67,133,68,197,205,17,149,205,10,172,98,139,123,11,198,192,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
