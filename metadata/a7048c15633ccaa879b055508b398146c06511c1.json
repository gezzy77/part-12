It is the story of how different groups or atheistic/materialistic men have played in an international chess tournament to decide which group would win ultimate control of the wealth, natural resources, and manpower of the entire world. It is explained how the game has reached the final stage. The lnternational Communists, and the International Capitalists, (both of whom have totalitarian ambitions) have temporarily joined hands to defeat Christian-democracy. The solution is to end the game the International Conspirators have been playing right now before one or another totalitarian-minded group impose their ideas on the rest of mankind. The story is sensational and shocking, but it is educational because it, is the TRUTH. The author offers practical solutions to problems so many people consider insoluble. The career Canadian naval officer&amp;#039;s historical overview, from a firmly Christian standpoint, of how Illuminati and Khazar conspirators have controlled capitalism and revolution from England&amp;#039;s 17th-century revolution through the Second World War. A former British Naval officer and an MI5 agent describes the worldwide conspiracy of &quot;Jewish&quot; (read: Zionist) bankers, who employ Communism as the battering ram against Christian states. Includes atrocities of Bolsheviks and of Spanish Communists described. Communism was created and funded by American bankers. Members of the same group were Roosevelt&amp;#039;s advisors during World War II. Carr produces enough evidence to make it believable. Hitler then tried to form an alliance with Britain in order to hunt down financiers from that same group. As Germany was the first nation to recover from the great depression, Hitler broke away from the International Bankers and enacted a system of monetary reform. It was successful until the Rothschilds raised trade sanctions against them. Hitler&amp;#039;s actions provoked the bankers to the point where they initiated war against him. Carr traced the history of the money lenders from their beginnings through to the formation of the Illuminati by Adam Weishaupt. He also traced the House of Rothschild from their beginnings as the head of the group of Goldsmiths that financed the English Revolution. He explains their involvement in almost every facet of our history. He explains how these things were funded, and by who. He gives detailed analysis of their methods. When a reader finishes the book they understand not only what&amp;#039;s happened in the past, but also to see how those same things are being initiated now. Pawns in the Game may be the best piece of literature to start you on the road to the truth regarding the behind the scenes workings of the Illuminati, Freemasonry, and the conspiratorial workings of the Internationalists. Learn the secrets behind the Revolutions, World Wars, money manipulations, and political intrigue that have made victims of us all. This writing is second to none in its step-by-step deciphering of historical events, and its clarification of the mis-information so many of us have been subjected to. Pawns in the Game is the culmination of a lifetime of research and when first printed in 1954 presented one of the earliest postwar accounts of how this international conspiracy works, which tools it uses and how it influences our lives. 200 pages. A must read for everyone.\n\nAbout the Author:\nAt the early age of twelve William Guy Carr was thoroughly indoctrinated into the Bolshevik ideology by two revolutionary missionaries who travelled on the same ship with him out to the Orient in 1907. Unlike many others he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t swallow the bait they offered him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hook, Line, and SinkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. He decided to keep an open mind, and to investigate matters thoroughly, before reaching any conclusions. His investigations and studies of all angles of the International Conspiracy have taken him to nearly every country in the world. Commander Carr has had a distinguished naval career. During World War One he served as Navigating Officer of H.M. Submarines. In World War Two he was Naval Control Officer for the St. Lawrence; then Staff Officer Operations at Shelbourne, N. S.; then Senior Naval Officer at Goose Bay, Labrador. As an Officer on the staff of Commodore Reginald Brock he organized the 7th Victory Loan for the twenty-two Royal Canadian Naval Training Divisions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7048c15633ccaa879b055508b398146c06511c1","amp;dn":"Carr-Pawns+in+Game%28international+conspiracy+exposed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7048c15633ccaa879b055508b398146c06511c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,4,140,21,99,60,202,168,121,176,85,80,139,57,129,70,192,101,17,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
