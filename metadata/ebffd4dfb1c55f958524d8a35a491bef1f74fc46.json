This is the first and only place I am uploading it. Please feel free to share it around but remember to give credit where credit is due.\n\nChapter markings are included for your convenience.\n\nPlease note that because of the way this is broadcast, it has been upscaled to 720p and so is not &quot;true&quot; 720p.\n\nVideo: \n\n720p @ 50fps (upscaled from 576i @ 25fps)\nEncoded w/Apple ProRes 422, H.264\n\nAudio:\n\nMPEG-2 Stereo @ 48kHz\nEncoded w/Apple ProRes 422, AAC\n\nPlease enjoy this show and make sure to check back next weekend for episode 4 and beyond!\n\nN.B.:\n\nThe opening vocals have a split-second cut off the beginning (thanks, CN - it was broadcast this way).
