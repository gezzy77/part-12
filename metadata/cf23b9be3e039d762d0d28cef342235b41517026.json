However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with TrenchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.\n\nGenre: Action | Comedy | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 6.9/10 from 24,175 users Metascore: 55/100\nDirected by: Baltasar KormÃƒÂ¡kur\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg, Paula Patton\n\nRelease Name: 2.Guns.2013.BDRip.X264-SPARKS\nSize: 702 MB\nVideo: MKV | 720Ãƒâ€”300\nAudio: English | AAC\nRuntime: 1h 49mn\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf23b9be3e039d762d0d28cef342235b41517026","amp;dn":"+2+Guns+2013+BDRip+X264-SPARKS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf23b9be3e039d762d0d28cef342235b41517026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,35,185,190,62,3,157,118,45,13,40,206,243,66,35,91,65,81,112,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
