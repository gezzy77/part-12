In fact, these solutions are now part of the problem. It is becoming quite clear that the only way to keep the food crisis from escalating is to promote the conversion processes that will move agriculture to sustainability.\n\nUnder the editorial guidance of agroecology experts Martha Rosemeyer and the internationally renowned Dr. Stephen R. Gliessman, The Conversion to Sustainable Agriculture: Principles, Processes, and Practices establishes a framework for how this conversion can be accomplished and presents case studies from around the world that illustrate how the process is already underway. The book provides a four-stage transition process for achieving sustainability and an in-depth analysis of the global efforts to make farms more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\nAn international team of chapter contributors explores ways to lessen dependency on fossil fuels and pesticides, and examines each step in the conversion process. They also describe the process of monitoring change toward sustainable agriculture while integrating social and economic analysis within scientific practices. Serving as both a core textbook for students and a comprehensive reference for agricultural practitioners, \n\n\n# Hardcover: 380 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (December 21, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 084931917X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0849319174","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766fd06bca4055d743943282cf4582b0aa018003","amp;dn":"The+Conversion+to+Sustainable+Agriculture%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766fd06bca4055d743943282cf4582b0aa018003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,111,208,107,202,64,85,215,67,148,50,130,207,69,130,176,170,1,128,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
