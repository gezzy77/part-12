It's just another exploration of the lovable troubadour's longstanding obsessions: the places he's been (&quot;Springtime in New York,&quot; &quot;Give Paris One More Chance&quot;), the pitfalls of love (&quot;Couples Must Fight,&quot; &quot;I Took a Chance on Her&quot;), the Spanish language (the last four songs, including a remake of the classic &quot;Vampire Girl&quot; en EspaÃƒÂ±ol). For fans, that should be enough, though even the diehards will have to admit that this is one of his slighter efforts. Two of the 14 tracks on this 32-minute album are instrumentals and an additional four are in Spanish. Moreover, the lyrics to several songs (&quot;Me and Her Got a Good Thing Goin' Baby,&quot; &quot;My Love for Her Ain't Sad&quot;) are even more simplistic and repetitious than usual. That said, Richman never fails to charm. The title track is pure magic; its moonstruck words and gently swinging sound, even its cumbersome title, posit an alternative universe in which rock &amp; roll only became more innocent and naÃƒÂ¯ve after the '50s. &quot;Springtime in New York,&quot; despite its sunny optimism, is clear-eyed and astute in its observations (&quot;On First Avenue, a couple is breaking up/Eviction too/They must be shaken up/But I love springtime in New York/I do&quot;). And the loopy enthusiasm of &quot;Give Paris One More Chance&quot; beats every tourist bureau jingle ever concocted (&quot;Because the home of Piaf and Charles Aznavour/Has done something right and shall do something more&quot;). Richman and his longtime drummer, Tommy Larkins, are joined here by Tom Waits associates Stephen Hodges (percussion) and Ralph Carney (woodwinds), as well as a pianist and string section, giving the album a warm, inviting feel. While far from a masterpiece, in its own way Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow is a portrait of the artist staying true to his unique and uncompromising vision.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c613333a17f37c4b367732a472a86e1ac39390a3","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Richman+-+2001+-+Her+Mystery...+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c613333a17f37c4b367732a472a86e1ac39390a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,19,51,58,23,243,124,75,54,119,50,164,114,168,110,26,195,147,144,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
