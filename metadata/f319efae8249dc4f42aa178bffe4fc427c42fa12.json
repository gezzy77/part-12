The unnamed (and extremely unreliable) narrator, who makes his living investigating accidents for a car company in order to assess their liability, is combating insomnia and a general sense of anomie by attending a steady series of support-group meetings for the grievously ill, at one of which (testicular cancer) he meets a young woman named Marla. She and the narrator get into a love triangle of sorts with Tyler Durden, a mysterious and gleefully destructive young man with whom the narrator starts a fight club, a secret society that offers young professionals the chance to beat one another to a bloody pulp. Mayhem ensues, beginning with the narratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s condo exploding and culminating with a terrorist attack on the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tallest building. Writing in an ironic deadpan and including something to offend everyone, Palahniuk is a risky writer who takes chances galore, especially with a particularly bizarre plot twist he throws in late in the book. Caustic, outrageous, bleakly funny, violent and always unsettling, PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s utterly original creation will make even the most jaded reader sit up and take notice.
