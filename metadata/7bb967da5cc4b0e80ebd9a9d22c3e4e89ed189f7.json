If we think that we cease to exist when we die, we have not looked very deeply at ourselves.&quot; \n\nIt is possible to live every day without being afraid of what happens when we die. Through a close examination of who we are, how we exist, and how we live, we can conquer our fear to live a freer and happier life. Through stories and lucid teachings, Thich Naht Hanh brings peace of mind to a difficult subject, and shows is how to live a happier life, free of fear.\n\n\n\n*** Sharing is caring.
