The album's biggest highlights are almost completely different from one another, demonstrated right from the beginning; the opener, the strutting, boastful, Missy Elliott-produced &quot;My Love Is Like...Wo&quot; is immediately followed by the yearning, elegant &quot;Falling.&quot; The constant changes of direction can be a little jarring on the first couple plays, but they eventually become one of the album's charms. Even the two expectedly strong Jam &amp; Lewis productions, the blissed-out &quot;Anatomy 1On1&quot; (&quot;Let's make a child&quot;) and the stressed-out &quot;Late&quot; (&quot;Should've been more careful when I let him rock my boat&quot;) are at two ends. Most surprising of all is &quot;Whatever Bitch,&quot; a stage-ready booty track in which Mya shows off her foul-mouthed catty side. Two big (mis)steps back threaten to kill her momentum, however, and they both come at the very end of this very long album: the bloodless cover of Tom Petty's &quot;Free Fallin'&quot; is worse than you could possibly imagine, and the awkward inclusion of &quot;Real Compared to What,&quot; the soft drink ad that originated as a civil rights/Vietnam protest song, was a very bad idea. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b7e7b0dee617c6dc8460bb15f5f2ef948f80069","amp;dn":"Mya+-+Moodring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b7e7b0dee617c6dc8460bb15f5f2ef948f80069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,126,123,13,238,97,124,109,200,70,11,177,95,95,46,249,72,248,0,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
