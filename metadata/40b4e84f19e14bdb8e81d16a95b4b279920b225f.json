The fourth edition of this classic work provides an up-to-date account of the nonlinear phenomena occurring inside optical fibers. The contents include such important topics as self- and cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering, four-wave mixing, modulation instability, and optical solitons. Many new figures have been added to help illustrate the concepts discussed in the book.\n\nNew to this edition are chapters on highly nonlinear fibers and and the novel nonlinear effects that have been observed in these fibers since 2000. Such a chapter should be of interest to people in the field of new wavelengths generation, which has potential application in medical diagnosis and treatments, spectroscopy, new wavelength lasers and light sources, etc.\n\n* Continues to be industry bestseller providing unique source of comprehensive coverage on the subject of nonlinear fiber optics\n* Fourth Edition is a completely up-to-date treatment of the nonlinear phenomena occurring inside optical fibers\n* Includes 2 NEW CHAPTERS on the properties of highly nonlinear fibers and their novel nonlinear effects\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Optics and Photonics\nHardcover: 552 pages\nPublisher: Academic Press; 4 edition (October 24, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0123695163\nISBN-13: 978-0123695161\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b4e84f19e14bdb8e81d16a95b4b279920b225f","amp;dn":"Nonlinear+Fiber+Optics%2C+Fourth+Edition+%28Optics+and+Photonics%29+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b4e84f19e14bdb8e81d16a95b4b279920b225f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,180,232,79,25,225,75,219,142,129,209,106,149,180,178,121,146,11,34,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
