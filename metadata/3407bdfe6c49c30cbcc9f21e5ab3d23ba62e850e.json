Both sides of the question are clearly presented, including the attacks on the character of King James I, word changes in the various editions of the KJV, the opinions of &quot;good, godly&quot; men about the so-called errors in the AV, and the variations between the editions of the Textus Receptus.\n\nThis book is the most complete book on textual criticism and manuscript evidence available; the culmination of Dr. Ruckman's work on the Authorized Version, a compilation of three decades of classroom studies.\n\nCitations are taken from the Greek texts of Nestle and Aland-Metzger; the canons of Griesbach and methods of choosing variant readings are explained, and Hort's theory on textual recension is given in his own words. Descriptions are given of how &quot;family genealogies and text types&quot; are constructed, how early manuscripts were written, and how the more than 200 English revisions since 1880 are attempts to corrupt the Bible. Lists 14 lies told daily by all the &quot;recognized&quot; Christian scholars and professors in America. The Septuagint is again proven to be an A.D. hoax, and family classifications are debunked.\n\nExamples are given of the superiority of the King James Authorized Version over &quot;THE&quot; Greek and Hebrew texts. This book thoroughly arms the student, minister, or any Christian who wishes to defend the King James Bible, against scholarly attack.\n\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree. Reading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3407bdfe6c49c30cbcc9f21e5ab3d23ba62e850e","amp;dn":"Biblical+Scholarship+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3407bdfe6c49c30cbcc9f21e5ab3d23ba62e850e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,7,189,254,108,73,195,12,188,201,242,30,90,179,210,59,166,46,133,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
