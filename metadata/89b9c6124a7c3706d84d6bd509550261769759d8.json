The band consists of songwriter, guitarist and vocalist Bethany Cosentino and guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Bobb Bruno. Cosentino, a former child actress, began writing music as a teenager and was formerly a member of the experimentalist drone group Pocahaunted. After a brief tenure at college in New York City, Cosentino returned to the West Coast and began recording lo-fi demos with Bruno, whom she met in the Los Angeles music scene.\nAfter a string of 7-inch and cassette-only singles, the band signed to Mexican Summer, who issued the band's debut, Crazy for You, in 2010. Crazy for You became an unexpected commercial success following Internet buzz surrounding the duo. Best Coast added a touring drummer, Ali Koehler of Vivian Girls, and spent much of 2011 on the road for festival appearances and tour dates. Best Coast's sophomore effort, The Only Place, was released in 2012 and featured a cleaner sound than their previous releases. The duo is currently preparing to release an EP, Fade Away (2013), and plan to record their third studio album in 2014.\nThe duo's music is often categorized under the subgenres of surf pop, garage rock, and lo-fi, and the band was primarily inspired by 1950/60s surf rock/girl groups.\n\n\nReview:\nBethany Cosentino is 26 years old and watching the clock anxiously. On her bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new mini-album, Fade Away, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often found monitoring the unsettling passage of time. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who I am this year,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ goes one song. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When did I wake up and suddenly my soul had grown so old?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she asks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last 30 seconds IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll wait for him,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings, resigned and bitter. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You taught me that my heart would grow old.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And as if giving herself a pep talk to buffer the unease: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Life is short but so am I. What does it matter, anyway?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Over the span of three years and two full-lengths, Cosentino has achieved a rarefied sort of indie-rock success and its attendant stardom, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still left asking the questions you ask once you realize adulthood is not the bed of enlightenment itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advertised to be. What do I have to show for myself? Am I any smarter than I used to be? Why isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t this getting easier? And literally: Who have I become?\nFade Away attempts to answer these questions in a single, satisfying way: by returning to the unmistakable elements that characterized Best Coast when they hatched during the fuzzy garage-pop boom a few years ago. She's back with propulsive melodies, a significant dose of reverb, repetition, and sticky, simple lyrics about aimlessness and the type of love that advances at a lackadaisical West Coast pace. The project is a return to form in the most literal of senses, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out on CosentinoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new label, Jewel City, and at an unorthodox seven-song length, it has the scrappy, self-governed feel of her bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early demos, albeit with a bit more polish. There are no name producers in the credits or songs that sound like jingles written for the Los Angeles Department of Tourism. Which is to say thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing on Fade Away that would fit naturally on Best CoastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slickly inert sophomore album, The Only Place, a record that boasted maturity but never really resonated.\nBut while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempting to claim that Best Coast have reverted to a simple formula, or to think of Fade Away as an easy stopgap between The Only Place and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next record, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening, either. There are touches of sophistication across Fade Away that Best Coast havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to achieve until now, and Cosentino glides easily between shades of guitar-pop and chillier sounds. She seems as comfortable on a swooning ballad (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fade AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) as she does on a song that harnesses the frenetic sugar of Josie and the Pussycats (Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Lonely MorningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or the gauzy whisper of Mazzy Star (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m CryingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexing her muscles as a songwriter, and she makes something thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably very difficult sound as though it comes easily to her.\nThe Cosentino who openly admits to struggle, or to not having figured it all out, then, is now relegated a familiar lyrical space. It can be easy to write her words off as too simplistic, too repetitive, or to dismiss them as retrograde in sentiment, but those qualities are what allow Best Coast to endure in a sea of acts with similar aesthetics. Cosentino is unafraid to fuss over the trivialities of plain old-fashioned love in a time when marriage has been described as the merging of brands. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambivalent or confused about pretty much everything while everyone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tastes are codified to Likes. She has become reliably great at distilling a complex range of human emotion to basic sentences, and all of a sudden, the weed leaves and cats and cut-outs of the shape of California are merely kitschy insignias rather than overarching frameworks. &quot;I won't change/ I'll stay the same,&quot; she sings on &quot;I Wanna Know&quot;. While Cosentino is anxious to figure out who sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become, Fade Away points to how strong sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been all along.\nReview by Carrie Battan [7.4/10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1.
