Commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy, it premiered on September 8, 1971, conducted by Maurice Peress. The performance was part of the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. \n\nOriginally, Bernstein had intended to compose a traditional Mass, but instead decided on a more innovative form. The work is based on the Tridentine Mass of the Roman Catholic Church. Although the liturgical passages are sung in Latin, Mass also includes additional texts in English written by Bernstein, Broadway composer Stephen Schwartz, and Paul Simon (who wrote the first quatrain of the trope &quot;Half of the People&quot;). The work is intended to be staged theatrically, but it has also been performed in a standard concert setting.\n\nInitial critical reception, including a review in the New York Times, was largely negative, but the Columbia Records and Sony Classical recordings of the work enjoyed excellent sales.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:396ad984c2ebe83de7a91ec66f2ad7f5ff7f85f7","amp;dn":"Leonard+Bernstein+-+MASS+%281971%29+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"396ad984c2ebe83de7a91ec66f2ad7f5ff7f85f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,106,217,132,194,235,232,61,231,169,30,198,111,42,215,245,255,127,133,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
