This collection of critical essays and investigative reports examines virtually every area of fringe science and the paranormal from a refreshingly scientific and clear-minded viewpoint. The authors are noted scientists, philosophers, psychologists, and writers. All bring to the task a determination to sift sense from nonsense and fact from fiction in an area notorious for misinformation, misperception, self-delusion, and wishful thinking. They do so in a way that highlights the differences between real science and pseudoscience.They've made special efforts first to find the actual facts behind numerous claims that have popular appeal, and then to explain and communicate what scientific investigation and reasoning reveal about them. Subjects treated to incisive and entertaining examination include astrology, ESP, psychic detectives, psychic predictions, parapsychology, remote-viewing, UFOs, creationism, the Shroud of Turin, coincidences, cult archaeology, palmistry and fringe medicine. There are also explorations of the implications of paranormal beliefs for science education.\n\nCONTENTS\nPart I - Assessing Claims of Paranormal Phenomena\nParapsychology and Belief\n1 - Debunking, Neutrality, and Skepticism in Science\n2 - The New Philosophy of Science and the ' Paranormal '\n3 - Parapsychology' s Past Eight Years : A Lack-of Progress Report\n4 - Sense and Nonsense in Parapsychology\nExpectation and Misperception\n5 - On Coincidences\n6 - Fooling Some of the People All of the Time\n7 - Misperception, Folk Belief, and the Occult: A Cognitive Guide to Understanding\n8 - The Great Stone Face and Other Nonmysteries\n9 - Sir Oliver Lodge and the Spiritualists\nClaims of Mind and Distance\n10 - Outracing the Evidence : The Muddled ' Mind Race '\n11 - Remote Viewing Revisited\n12 - Gerard Croiset: Investigation of the Mozart of &quot;Psychic Sleuths &quot;\n1 3 - Croiset and Professor Tenhaeff: Discrepancies in Claims of Clairvoyance\nClaims of Mind and Matter\n14 - The Columbus Poltergeist Case\n15 - The Project Alpha Experiment\n16 - Lessons of a Landmark PK Hoax\n18 - How Not to Test a Psychic: The Great SRI Die Mystery\nClaims of Mind and Body\n19 - Iridology: Diagnosis or Delusion?\n20 - Palmistry: Science or Hand-Jive?\nPsychic Flim-Flam: An Example\n21 - Prediction After the Fact: Lessons of the Tamara  Rand Hoax\n\nPart II - Evaluating Fringe Science\nAstrology\n22 - Scientific Tests of Astrology Do Not Support Its Claims\n23 - Alternative Explanations in Science: The Extroversion-Introversion . . .\n24 - The Alleged Lunar Effect\n25 - The Moon Is Acquitted of Murder in Cleveland \nUFOs\n26 - The Claim of a Government UFO Coverup\n27 - An Eye-Opening Double Encounter\n28 - Hypnosis and UFO Abductions\n29 - Hypnosis Gives Rise to Fantasy and Is Not a Truth Serum\nFringe Archaeology\n30 - Deciphering Ancient America\n31 - American Disingenuous : Goodman ' s ' American Genesis ' -A New Chapter in . .\n32 - The Nazca Drawings Revisited: Creation of a Full-Sized Duplicate\n33 - Science and the Mountain Peak\n34 - Creationist Pseudoscience\n35 - Paluxy Footprints\n36 - The Shroud of Turin: A Critical Appraisal\n37 - Shroud Image Is the Work of an Artist\nCryptozoology\n38 - Sonar and Photographic Searches for the Loch Ness Monster: A Reassessment\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b162f2d878933d4398dbf1262a2f7782abd6ce12","amp;dn":"Science+Confronts+the+Paranormal+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b162f2d878933d4398dbf1262a2f7782abd6ce12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,98,242,216,120,147,61,67,152,219,241,38,42,47,119,130,171,214,206,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
