But it is really Diane Keaton's film. Based on the novel from 1975 by Judith Rossner, which provoked much discussion, because a woman back then was not supposed to lead a double life as a precious school teacher during the day and a bar-cruiser at night.\n\nAlso noteworthy for being one of the very first films with Tom Berenger, here as a naked gay transvestite, perhaps regretted later in his career of action films.\n\nWARNING: Much nudity and sex, and the plot starts off with harsh social realism until Gere's interesting character enters after 44 minutes.\nAmazon has promised a proper DVD edition for a long time. Until then, we have so far had only bad VHS fullscreen rips, but I found this old TV rip in my collection and tried to doctor it a little. Much better than VHS, but still not full DVD quality. Colors are a little faded, and sound level a little low.\n\nWidescreen TV-rip XviD 2-pass 672x368, original mono sound AC3.\nRuns well in both my standalone DivX players.\n\nMediaInfo analysis:\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nOveral bit rate                  : 750 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nMuxing mode                      : Packet Bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nBit rate                         : 612 Kbps\nWidth                            : 672 pixels\nHeight                           : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.099\nStream size                      : 571 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 119 MiB\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : CBR\n\nP.S.: Richard Gere said in an interview that his personal life at this time was very far from the sex-athlete characters he plays in this film and 'American Gigolo'. He played a character with bipolar disorder again in 'Mr. Jones' (1993).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23a1c9a421a6774d7e8e5eebd816bb9883ac865","amp;dn":"Looking+for+Mr+Goodbar+%281977%29Richard+Gere%28TVrip+Widescreen%29_Kuth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23a1c9a421a6774d7e8e5eebd816bb9883ac865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,58,28,154,66,26,103,116,215,232,229,238,189,129,107,185,136,58,200,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
