The &quot;ghosts&quot; of people involved in the events appear in his memories to assist him in determining his guilt in the affair. The reminiscences are mixed with the real action: the flight of the &quot;Italia&quot;, the air rescue operation from Kings Bay airfield, the expedition of the &quot;Krassin&quot; ice-breaker. A sort of human touch is added by the ever beautiful C.C. playing Malmgren's girlfriend. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c5259f7a60ef6da463753428788cb197461595","amp;dn":"The+Red+Tent+%5BSean+Connery%5D+%281969%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15c5259f7a60ef6da463753428788cb197461595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,197,37,159,122,96,239,109,164,99,117,52,40,120,140,177,151,70,21,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
