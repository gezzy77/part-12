This issue was for some reason excluded from both the original source torrent by blackcanary that I used for the v2 collection as well as the massive 5 volume torrent by nemesis43, so now you have it finally available. I have also added alternative low-res Digital rips of the first 5 issues of v2, as well as a high-res version of issue 50 by Mr. Woodman (possibly my favorite issue of Wolverine ever). Thanks to all the scanners, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e9328c8d39b7f18776657e4663ae6da06cc0dd","amp;dn":"Wolverine+v2+102.5+%2B+Alternate+Scans+%281988-1996%7CD%2BS%7CMr.+Woodman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e9328c8d39b7f18776657e4663ae6da06cc0dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,233,50,140,141,57,183,241,135,118,101,126,70,99,174,109,160,108,192,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
