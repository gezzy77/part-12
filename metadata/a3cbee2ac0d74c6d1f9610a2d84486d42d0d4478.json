Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. But Nelson was extraordinarily consistent during the first five years of his recording career, crafting pleasant pop-rockabilly hybrids with ace session players and projecting an archetype of the sensitive, reticent young adult with his accomplished vocals. He also played a somewhat underestimated role in rock &amp; roll's absorption into mainstream America -- how bad could rock be if it was featured on one of America's favorite family situation comedies on a weekly basis? \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I'm Walkin'\n02.Be-Bop Baby (Single Version)\n03.Stood Up\n04.Believe What You Say (Single Version)\n05.Poor Little Fool\n06.Lonesome Town\n07.I Got A Feeling\n08.Never Be Anyone Else But You\n09.It's Late\n10.Just A Little Too Much\n11.Sweeter Than You\n12.Travelin' Man\n13.Hello Mary Lou\n14.Everlovin'\n15.Young World\n16.Teenage Idol\n17.Fools Rush In\n18.For You\n19.She Belongs To Me (Feat.
