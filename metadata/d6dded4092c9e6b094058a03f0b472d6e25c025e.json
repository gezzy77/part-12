In addition to text, 2nd Speech Center also allows you to convert text to MP3 or WAVE files for listening later with your portable MP3 player.\n\n2nd Speech Center can directly open Plain Text files (.txt), Microsoft Word files (.doc), PDF files (.pdf), EMail files (.eml), Rich Text files (.rtf), HTML files. For Microsoft Internet Explorer users, 2nd Speech Center supplies a handy toolbar plug-in for Internet Explorer. 2nd Speech Center supports dozens of male, female and robotic voices for over 11 languages. 2nd Speech Center can monitor the Windows Clipboard and automatically process its contents. This feature makes it easy to read web pages, e-mail messages, documents and much more.\n\nAdditionally, 2nd Speech Center is integrated with many useful and timesaving features, such as talking alarm clock, talking reminder and powerful command lines for advanced users. And don't worry, the well designed user interface is very easy to use.\n\n---------------------------\nInstructions Very Easy\n---------------------------\nSee this screenshot\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/5080064771_ecbeb38895_b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/5080064771_ecbeb38895_b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.Install &quot;2nd Speech 4.00.10.822.exe setup.&quot; At the end of the setup, dont launch the program and if you've launched the program then close it.\n2. Double click on the &quot;Registry_Patch_after_setup.reg&quot; file, and it'll patch the registry and the program will run without any trial limit.\n\nProof that registry patch works &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/5080064775_d7bbb5350b_b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/5080064775_d7bbb5350b_b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------\nNO SEEDS? NO PROBLEM!\n----------------\nIf you're unable to download this torrent or warez file then \n1. Download trial software of 2nd Speech v4 from Softpedia or its official site and install it.\n2. In the notepad, copy following text (between the ----- dotted lines) and save as &quot;install.reg&quot; (select &quot;All Files&quot; in filetypes while saving otherwise it'll save it as &quot;install.reg.txt&quot; and that will not work!)\n---------------------------------------------\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\02k]\n\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\02k\\JJTD5]\n&quot;RegName&quot;=&quot;cmhdream&quot;\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAfter saving the file, double click that registry file to add it in your registry and voila!! the trial program is unlocked for full functional use forever.\nBut donot forget to prevent it from updating by blocking its internet acccess from the firewall!\n\nI found this trick from a chinese website, because unfortunately this great software wasn't released in the english sites yet so I'm doing it.\nFor optimal voice result, download Neospeech Julie or Kate or Jeniffer.  They sound like real females, and not like the robotic Microsoft SAM.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6dded4092c9e6b094058a03f0b472d6e25c025e","amp;dn":"2nd+Speech+4.00.10.822+Text+to+Speech+%28TTS%29+Full+Program+with+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6dded4092c9e6b094058a03f0b472d6e25c025e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,221,237,64,146,201,230,176,148,5,138,3,240,180,114,214,226,92,2,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
