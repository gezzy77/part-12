But how do we separate truth from imagination? Was Princess Diana murdered, as many people think, despite all the official denials? Did NASA really go to the Moon, when anomalies in the photographic record suggest otherwise? Could 9/11 really have been set up by agencies within the USA itself? The author opens the conspiracy casebook by examining the mindset of those who believe in conspiracies, and considers whether the dismissive attitude towards them has been fair.\n\nPart Two looks into history to establish that when conspiracies do occur, credibility should therefore be given to belief in some of the alleged plots and cover-ups of today. This leads into a well-argued examination of some of the most popular conspiracies of our times, including theories over assassinations, UFO cover-ups, and widely voiced concerns over 9/11 and the 'New World Order'.\n\nPart Three draws the conclusion that while not all conspiracy theories can be proven, they do at least draw attention to paths not to take, and can be valuable in helping to create a better world where new trust and hope can be forged. Are we living in a world of control, of oppression, of habitual deception? Is this really how things are, or simply human nature massively distorted through a dark lens? The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d705885b32c5a4212dae1c0f3a4bb5b09506569f","amp;dn":"Conspiracies+-+The+Facts%2C+The+Theories%2C+The+Evidence+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d705885b32c5a4212dae1c0f3a4bb5b09506569f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,5,136,91,50,197,164,33,45,174,28,15,58,75,181,176,149,6,86,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
