A single from the album, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;/&quot;Hey Tonight&quot;, was released in January 1971.\n\nPendulum is their only album to not contain any cover songs; all tracks were written by John Fogerty. It was the last album the band did with Tom Fogerty, who would leave the band to start a solo career. It was also the last album to feature John Fogerty as the record's sole producer.\n\nThe most sonically adventurous CCR album, Pendulum is noted for its widespread use of horns and keyboards, in contrast to the group's previous albums, which were dominated by guitar. Among several lesser-known Fogerty songs (&quot;Pagan Baby&quot;, &quot;Sailor's Lament&quot;, &quot;It's Just a Thought&quot;, &quot;Born to Move&quot;) were two top-ten hits, &quot;Hey Tonight&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;. Both songs reached number eight in 1971. It also contains their only avant-garde venture, &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot;.\n\nformat  320 kbps.mp3\n\nmy second torrent ever[ the noveltys wearing off so i wont comment about that unless of course i make big mistakes]\n\n\n\n\nSide one\n\n    &quot;Pagan Baby&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:25\n    &quot;Sailor's Lament&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Chameleon&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n    &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n    &quot;(Wish I Could) Hideaway&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n\nSide two\n\n    &quot;Born to Move&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n    &quot;Hey Tonight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n    &quot;It's Just a Thought&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\n    &quot;Molina&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:41\n    &quot;Rude Awakening #2&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:19","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d16528fa9c246c5f8958dbcd6f8ae9dbefe8712","amp;dn":"CCR-Pendulum+%5B1970%5D+320+kbps.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d16528fa9c246c5f8958dbcd6f8ae9dbefe8712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,22,82,143,169,194,70,197,248,149,141,188,214,248,174,157,190,254,135,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
