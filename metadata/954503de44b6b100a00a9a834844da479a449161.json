In an unbiased manner, musical worlds approach each other, that seemed almost incompatible for a long time. Whether acoustic music, contemporary classical music or hip-hop - such styles join a boundless melange to something new, which has an high artistic value, and is gaining new fans in a rapid pace. Roland Voss aka &quot;Lemongrass&quot; is part of this creative stream. Over many years, a distinctive &quot;Lemongrass&quot; sound has been developed in an essential process of maturation. Culminating now with a new album release called &quot;MÃƒÂ©moires&quot;.\n\nAlready the opener, &quot;Journal Intime&quot; is a wonderful testimony for the derived stylistic fruition. On a creaky-minimal rhythm enfold heart warming, ethereal sound images, peaking in the middle part by the addition of a stunning piano motif. Fine-tuned piano sounds are recurrently defining elements in the further course of the album. In &quot;Liaison&quot;, a typical &quot;Lemongrass&quot; bassline groove builds to an airy, buttery soft daydreamer. &quot;Sacred Dreams&quot; fascinates with a deep piano-loop and heavenly backing vocals in harmony with a playful scratchy glitch-hop rhythm. Highlight here is the brief interlude of a cool, distorted guitar. The title of the subsequent &quot;I'm stellar&quot; is almost programmatic for the spiritual flow of the album. Carefully produced in detail, &quot;I'm stellar&quot; is led by a simple guitar melody, on which the track harmoniously unfolds.\n\nWith &quot;Oiseau de Paradis&quot; Roland Voss loosens up his journey with a trip to Mediterranean regions. Sweet summery harmonies awaken anticipation for the warm and light-coloured time of the year. With &quot;Summer fields&quot;, we remain a little longer in the sunshine. Wonderfully laid-back, the track grooves along, based on subtle hip-hop elements. Don't be surprised if your head starts nodding on its own, and a broad smile appears on your face. The album continues with some best of lounge music. &quot;Bossa del mar&quot; I.\n\n======================================================================================\n\nLemongrass - A Dream Within A Dream (2013) Album @ MP3 (V0)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8552756/Lemongrass_-_A_Dream_Within_A_Dream_(2013)_Album___MP3_(V0)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8552756/Lemongrass_-_A_Dream_Within_A_Dream_(2013)_Album___MP3_(V0)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954503de44b6b100a00a9a834844da479a449161","amp;dn":"Lemongrass+-+M%26eacute%3Bmoires+%282014%29+2014+Album+%40+MP3+%2F+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954503de44b6b100a00a9a834844da479a449161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,69,3,222,68,182,177,0,160,10,154,131,72,68,218,71,154,68,145,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
