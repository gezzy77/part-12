From the powerful title track to numbers like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fall DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“David and GoliathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freight TrainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hell Or High WaterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The slab of rock that Snake Eyes Seven serve up here is surely going to get your juices flowing. \nDaniel NarangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are raw and powerful. The range of emotions he manages to convey is truly stunning. While Cole StevensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ guitar work is mind blowing. \n\n                   Snake Eyes Seven - 13 Crows\n\n\n01. 13 Crows (04:01)\n\n02. Can't Fall Down (03:20)\n\n03.
