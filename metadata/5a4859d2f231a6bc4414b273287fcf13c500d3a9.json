Anyway, here it is...\n\n\nplot:\nTwo Swedish business men are kidnapped in Rome by the Mob, and moved to Sicily. Carl Hamilton is sent to Sicily on direct order from the Swedish Government. He is sent to negotiate for their release. Hamiltons partner and best friend, Lundwall, is murdered by the Mob. Hamilton is dragged into a bitter and brutal vendetta between himself and the Mob-leader Don Tommaso.\n\ncomment:\nStefan Sauk plays the Swedish equivalent of James Bond(kind of at least) in this action thriller involving the Sicilian maffia in the Hamilton saga.I think Sauk is the best Carl Hamilton ever.He brings so much power and intensity to this role.Stellan SkarsgÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥rd was ok as Hamilton,didnt have sense for Stormare or Peter Haber and noone of these come close to Sauk\\\\\\&amp;#039;s interpretation.Sauk shows both guts and wit in this solid thriller.The supporting ensemble cast gotta be some of Italy\\\\\\&amp;#039;s finest actors.A nice way to spend October afternoon. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4859d2f231a6bc4414b273287fcf13c500d3a9","amp;dn":"Vendetta+-+1995+%28TV+version%29+-+Stefan+auk+as+Carl+Hamilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a4859d2f231a6bc4414b273287fcf13c500d3a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,72,89,210,242,49,166,188,68,20,178,115,40,127,207,19,197,0,211,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
