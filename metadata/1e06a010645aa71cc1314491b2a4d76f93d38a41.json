Instructors select the topics that are most appropriate for their course. Its conceptual approach helps students more easily understand the concepts and interpret SPSS and research results. Key concepts are simply stated and occasionally reintroduced and related to one another for reinforcement. Numerous examples demonstrate their relevance. This edition features more explanation to increase understanding of the concepts. Only crucial equations are included.\n\nThe format is a bit messed up with the headings, but the original was like that also. The PDF looked shit so here is an epub.\n\nLeave a comment if this helped you out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e06a010645aa71cc1314491b2a4d76f93d38a41","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Statistical+Concepts%3A+Third+Edition+-+Richard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e06a010645aa71cc1314491b2a4d76f93d38a41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,6,160,16,100,90,167,28,193,49,68,145,178,164,215,111,147,211,138,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
