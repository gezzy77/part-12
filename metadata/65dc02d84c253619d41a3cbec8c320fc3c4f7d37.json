Specifically, the Grand Fall entails the violent collision of twin planets Inferia and Celestia. The journey takes Reid across both planets, as he seeks out those responsible for this movement towards the brink of annihilation.\n\nGame: Tales of Eternia (EUR)\nGame ID: ULES-00176\nRelease Date: February 10, 2006\nRegion: EUR\nMedia: ISO\nImage Size: 673 MB (706,154,496 bytes)\nFiles: 11x47.6Mb + NFO\nPlatform: PlayStation Portable\nFiles: Tales of Eternia [Undub] BATTLEFIX DnT.*\nBase Files: Tales of Eternia (EU) + Tales of Eternia (JP)\nUndub Credit: Drakia - Main undubbing\nOniYuri - Japanese verification\n\n*** Details\nThis is only my second Undub (And this one took a LOT more work)\nso if you run into any problems, let me know :)\n* Restored Japanese VA on 01.PMF, 15.PMF\n* Subtitled 15.PMF\n* Restored original opening music\n* Restored all original Japanese VA\n\n*** BATTLEFIX Details\n* Restored in-battle yelling.

This has been downloaded by over 100 users on another tracker, with no bug reports. It was going to be exclusive to that tracker, but I just happened to get banned for talking back to an admin Hope everyone enjoys this game how it should have been made. The NFO is also wrong about the RAR count, I re-made the archive for upload here, as this release includes the BATTLEFIX, so it should be 11x47.6mb :)\n\n*** My upload speed isn't too great, so try not to complain :) Also, this is the same release as is uploaded to Demonoid, if you could help seed that would be nice :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65dc02d84c253619d41a3cbec8c320fc3c4f7d37","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Tales+of+Eternia+%5BUndub%5D+BATTLEFIX+DnT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65dc02d84c253619d41a3cbec8c320fc3c4f7d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,220,2,216,76,37,54,25,212,26,60,190,200,195,32,252,60,79,125,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
