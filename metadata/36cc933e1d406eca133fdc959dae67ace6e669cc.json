Although it contains none of their Casablanca recordings, and therefore it's missing their biggest hit, &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight,&quot; it does have a comprehensive chronicle of the group's first four albums, including their breakthrough hit &quot;Amie,&quot; the non-LP &quot;She Darked the Sun,&quot; and nearly all of their best album, Bustin' Out, albeit not in sequence. It would have been nice to have &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight&quot; added to this collection, but it's hard to argue with what's here, since it is the best of the best years of Pure Prairie League.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-r430026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-r430026&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001O2UA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001O2UA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
