The 44 tracks on At Last The Lost Radio Recordings consists ENTIRELY of songs Peggy never recorded commercially, ranging from popular standards to novelty numbers to songs popularized by such esteemed peers as Doris Day, Rosemary Clooney, Dinah Shore, Jo Stafford, Kay Starr and Margaret Whiting, with musical direction by Sonny Burke in Los Angeles and Russ Case in New York. \r\n\r\nMost of these recordings haven t been heard since they were originally broadcast, and as this is the first-ever collection of its kind licensed directly from the Peggy Lee estate, this 2-CD set offers superior sound with remastering by Mike Milchner at SonicVision, rarely-seen photos, and expert liner notes by David Torresen, long-time editor of PeggyLee.com, her official website. Many folks feel that Peggy never sang as well as she did in the early and mid-1950s; her maturity (in her thirties) and confidence had fully blossomed, her phrasing perfected and the timbre of her voice was pure gossamer. Listening to her interpret this new material is a revelation an absolute must-have and a major, historic addition to the Peggy Lee discography and legacy\r\n\r\nPeggy frequently guested on Forties radio shows with forty-nine appearances on Bing Crosbyâ€™s, so her self-titled early-Fifties series was well-earned - running for eighty-nine episodes during its two year on-air period. Therefore, this double-disc collection of forty-four songs from the series is a real treat as they are numbers Peggy never commercially recorded. Choices are well-spread with standards like the setâ€™s title number, JUST ONE MORE CHANCE, SKYLARK, I GOT RHYTHM and JOHNNY ONE-NOTE plus traditional ditties DANNY BOY, OH, DEAR WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE? and a touch of Verdiâ€™s ADDIO DEL PASSATO updated to SINCE MY LOVE WENT AWAY. Besides feasting on songs from Broadway shows/Hollywood movies via GETTING TO KNOW YOU, A DATE WITH JUDY, ZING A LITTLE ZONG, MY DARLING, MY DARLING as fine examples, Peggy approaches pop songs of the day with THE LITTLE WHITE CLOUD THAT CRIED, CRY, PLEASE MR.SUN, BOTCH-A-ME, COME ON A-MY HOUSE and BLACKSMITH BLUES nicely delivered in her inimitable â€œless is moreâ€ style.\r\n\r\nThe booklet contains career, radio show and song credits along with some full-page shots of glamorous Peggy which also adorn the three-panel eco-styled packaging.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01.
