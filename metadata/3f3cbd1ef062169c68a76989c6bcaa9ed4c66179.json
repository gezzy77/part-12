The first model came out in 1987 followed one year later by a CD extension that made the PC-Engine the first console to have CD games.\n\nThis was quite an impressive machine, with good graphic capacities (16-bit video processor, 512 colors, 64 sprites) and a fast and powerful 8-bit CPU. It also had a very good game collection, with unique and high quality games. And even today some PC-Engine games are still without an equivalent on modern consoles. Of course if you only enjoy 3-D games, well, the PC-Engine may disappoint you a bit, but if you love good old 2-D games, especially shoot&amp;#039;em up, give it a try, it really has some excellent games!\n\nBut we are sure that you already know all that.\n\nGo find those PC-Engine CD-ROMs that you stored in a cupboard a few years ago, remove the dust on them, and go downloading MagicEngine!\n\nAnd don&amp;#039;t forget to register after...\n\nMagicEngine emulates the PC-Engine almost perfectly. The emulator has:\n\n    * full HuCard emulation!\n    * full SuperGrafx emulation!\n    * full CD-ROM and Super CD-ROM emulation!\n      (with a custom System Card - no BIOS ROM needed)\n    * full Arcade Card emulation!\n    * very accurate and fast emulation!\n    * game save/load feature!\n    * nice and easy to use graphical user interface!\n    * five players mode - fully configurable!\n\n\n                         MagicEngine v1.0.0 PR 10\n                         ========================\n              Copyright (c) 1997-2005 David &amp;
