As a child growing up in Wales, she played among the spirits who made their homes in industrial ruins. But her mind found freedom and promise in the science fiction novels that were her closest companions. Then her mother tried to bend the spirits to dark ends, and Mori was forced to confront her in a magical battle that left her crippled--and her twin sister dead.\n\nFleeing to her father whom she barely knew, Mori was sent to boarding school in EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â€œa place all but devoid of true magic. There, outcast and alone, she tempted fate by doing magic herself, in an attempt to find a circle of like-minded friends. But her magic also drew the attention of her mother, bringing about a reckoning that could no longer be put offÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCombining elements of autobiography with flights of imagination in the manner of novels like Jonathan LethemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Fortress of Solitude, this is potentially a breakout book for an author whose genius has already been hailed by peers like Kelly Link, Sarah Weinman, and Ursula K. Le Guin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87a884a7b25825a0156e68ddb43fa6727bc2c57","amp;dn":"Among+Others+by+Jo+Watson+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87a884a7b25825a0156e68ddb43fa6727bc2c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,122,136,74,123,37,130,90,1,86,230,141,219,67,250,103,39,188,44,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
