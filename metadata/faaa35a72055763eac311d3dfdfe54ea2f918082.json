What if we could learn to follow the often-intimidating language of key signatures, pitch, mode, melody, meter, and other parts of musical structure used by composers? What if we could recognize these various components at work as we listened to our favorite music? What if we could &quot;speak&quot; the language of Western music?\n\nIt's a language that Professor Robert Greenberg calls rich, varied, and magnificent, and he has little doubt about the rewards of even a beginning level of fluency.\n\n&quot;It's a language that pays us back tenfoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a hundredfoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for every detail we come to recognize and perceive! And it's a language that will only get richer and more varied, as our increasingly global culture contributes ever more vocabulary to it.&quot;\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n1.
