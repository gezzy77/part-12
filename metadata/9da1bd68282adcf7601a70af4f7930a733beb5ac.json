Mike Howlett again handled the production chores, but the band errantly chose to pursue even more reliance on electronics, which gives Listen a bit of a sterile feel. Nonetheless, there are still several tracks here that are as strong as their debut, even if, as a whole, the album isn't as consistent.\n\nListen spawned only one hit, but it's a gem; the multi-layered, hypnotic &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You).&quot; Other standouts include the eerie, moody &quot;Nightmares,&quot; with its sparse guitar and synthesizer squawks and a surprisingly effective ballad &quot;Transfer Affection.&quot; Ultimately, the band loses the plot on the second half, when they seem to forget melodies and focus on hardware. Although, the Bill Nelson-produced &quot;(It's Not Me) Talking&quot; is a bracing, breakneck tempo return to their interest in aliens. Listen is most likely to be enjoyed most by fans of the band only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9da1bd68282adcf7601a70af4f7930a733beb5ac","amp;dn":"A+Flock+of+Seagulls+-+Listen+%40VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9da1bd68282adcf7601a70af4f7930a733beb5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,161,189,104,40,42,220,247,96,26,112,175,79,121,48,167,51,190,181,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
