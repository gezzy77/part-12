Today, virtually all the materials and hardware used by custom closet fabricators is available to consumers on the racks of home centers and hardware stores. \n\nBuild Your Own Custom Closet is the first book to show consumers all the inside tips on designing a custom closet, and how to install it using materials they can buy themselves. This is the book that will lift readers from closet purgatory into the heaven of the well-organized closet-without selling their souls.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94264fb619d2c116a0778611e703e4905189b34b","amp;dn":"Black+%26amp%3B+Decker+Build+Your+Own+Custom+Closet+by+Gillett+Cole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94264fb619d2c116a0778611e703e4905189b34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,38,79,182,25,210,193,22,160,119,134,17,231,3,228,144,81,137,179,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
