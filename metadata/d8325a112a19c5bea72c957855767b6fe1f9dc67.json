It was released on September 12, 2008 through Warner Bros. Records. It was the band\\'s first album to feature bassist Robert Trujillo as well as its first album to be produced by Rick Rubin, also being Metallica\\'s first album since its fourth album ...And Justice for All (1988) that was not produced by Bob Rock.\n\nMusically, the album is a radical departure from Metallica\\'s previous album, St. Anger, which features no guitar solos, a very modern heavy metal sound, and low-quality production. Death Magnetic, on the other hand, features very long, technical guitar solos from both Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield, marking a slight return to the band\\'s thrash metal roots. Death Magnetic was also the band\\'s first album released through Warner Bros. Records, although they still remain with Warner Music Group, which also owns their previous label, Elektra Records. Outside of North America, they are distributed through Universal Music Group as they remain signed to Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom. The album is also the band\\'s fifth consecutive studio album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States, making Metallica the first band ever to do so.[1][2][3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8325a112a19c5bea72c957855767b6fe1f9dc67","amp;dn":"Metallica+Death+Magnetic+%26+Arts+2011+Remastered+Edition+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8325a112a19c5bea72c957855767b6fe1f9dc67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,50,90,17,42,25,197,190,167,44,149,120,85,118,123,111,225,249,220,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
