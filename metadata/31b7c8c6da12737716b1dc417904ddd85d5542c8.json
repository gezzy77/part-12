The\nfunctional approach to programming achieves this aim because logical concepts\nare evident and programs are transparent so can be written quickly and cleanly.\nIn this book the authors emphasise the notions of function and function \napplication which relate programming to familiar concepts from mathematics and\nlogic.They introduce functional programming via examples but also explain what \nprograms compute and how to reason about them. They show how the ideas can be \nimplemented in the CAML language,and give examples of how complex programs from\na variety of areas(such as arithmetic,tree algorithms, graph algorithms,text \nparsing and geometry) can be developed in close agreement with their \nspecifications.Many exercises and examples are included throughout the book;\nsolutions are also available.An appendix gives all the code used in the book in\nStandard ML. \nGuy Cousineau is a professor at ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°cole Normale SupÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rieure in Paris and head of \nthe computer science laboratory.\nMichel Mauny is Directeur de Recherche at INRIA-Rocquencourt, and head of the \nCristal research team,where the CAML language is being developed.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChapters\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI- Basic Principles\n  1- Expressions\n  2- Data Structures\n  3- Semantics\n  4- Imperative Aspects\nII- Applications\n  5- Formal Terms, Pattern Matching, Unification\n  6- Balanced Trees\n  7- Graphs and Problem Solving\n  8- Syntatic Analysis\n  9- Geometry and Drawings\n  10- Exact Arithmetic\nIII- Implementation\n  11- Evaluation\n  12- Compilation\n  13- Type Synthesis\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b7c8c6da12737716b1dc417904ddd85d5542c8","amp;dn":"%5Bebook%5DThe+Functional+Approach+to+programming+with+CAML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b7c8c6da12737716b1dc417904ddd85d5542c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,183,200,198,218,18,115,119,22,177,220,65,121,4,221,216,93,85,66,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
