Extraordinarily beautiful, utilising an array of unusual stylistic devices, it seems as if Sokurov's style was fully formed from the outset.  A sublime meditation on love, loneliness, life and death, it still stands as one of his finest achievements.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img222.imageshack.us/img222/8462/lonelyez1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img222.imageshack.us/img222/8462/lonelyez1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-----not my rip-------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,046,900,736 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:22:01\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x528 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1503 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.162 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
