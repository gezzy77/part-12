Exactly one week after watching the tape, four teenagers die one after another of heart failure.\n\nAsakawa, a hardworking journalist, is intrigued by his niece's inexplicable death. His investigation leads him from a metropolitan tokyo teeming with modern society's fears to a rural Japan--a mountain resort, a volcanic island, and a countryside clinic--haunted by the past. His attempt to solve the tape's mystery before it's too late--for everyone--assumes an increasingly deadly urgency. Ring is a chillingly told horror story, a masterfully suspenseful mystery, and post-modern trip.\n\nThe success of Koji Suzuki's novel the Ring has lead to manga, television and film adaptations in Japan, Korea, and the U.S.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612f2e2f4a76b3b034e256351a6af08994df8909","amp;dn":"Ring+-++Suzuki+Koji.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612f2e2f4a76b3b034e256351a6af08994df8909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,47,46,47,74,118,179,176,52,226,86,53,26,106,240,137,148,223,137,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
