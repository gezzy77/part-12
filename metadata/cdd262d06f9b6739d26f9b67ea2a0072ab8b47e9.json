Maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the island thing. Whatever it is, reggae pulses through HawaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢i, influencing artists like no other genre of music. None have achieved the level of popularity and acclaim of Natural Vibrations, who incorporate this Jamaican music foundation and HawaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ian vibe with the pop, rock, and rap music of today to create their own unique sound.\n\nFormed in 1993 as a group of friends getting together at backyard parties in KahaluÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“u on OahuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Windward side, before they knew it Natural Vibrations were performing locally, recording, and touring on a regular basis. Today, they are one of the most popular bands in HawaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“i, and gaining ground quickly on the Mainland and beyond.\n\nNatural Vibrations, also known as Natural Vibes, Natty Vibes or simply Da Vibes by their countless fans, describe themselves as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwild, sexually explicit, three-ring circus-like, hard-partying, fun-loving, pop/rock/reggae band.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Critics have praised their straight-ahead, no-holds-barred pop/rock/reggae style, blended with their sweet treatment of classic, timeless love and relationship themes. Natural VibrationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ homegrown songs are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrootsy, funky, rock steady and romantic, with a touch of dub,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and shows the growth and progress of The Vibes as a band that is ready to break out and become the next major international artist from HawaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“i.\n\nAlthough Natural Vibrations is comprised of six very different personalities, the synergy between them is extraordinary and comes together on stage, creating a dynamic visual/musical experience. Their fans pack the front of the stage, dancing and singing along with every song. Their musical backgrounds are varied...citing influences from Prince and Michael McDonald to Bob Marley and UB 40. Each member of the Vibes plays multiple musical instruments as well as contributes to the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songwriting, and five of the guys trade off on lead vocals, adding to the strength and diversification of the show.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd262d06f9b6739d26f9b67ea2a0072ab8b47e9","amp;dn":"Natural+Vibrations-++Getting+High%2C+All+Natural%2C+The+Circle%2C+From","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd262d06f9b6739d26f9b67ea2a0072ab8b47e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,210,98,208,111,155,103,57,210,111,155,103,234,42,0,114,171,139,71,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
