It proposes a pedagogy with a new relationship between teacher, student, and society. It was first published in Portuguese in 1968, and was translated and published in English in 1970.[1]\n\nDedicated to what is called &quot;the oppressed&quot; and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed Marxist class analysis in his exploration of the relationship between what he calls &quot;the colonizer&quot; and &quot;the colonized.&quot; The book remains popular among educators all over the world and is one of the foundations of critical pedagogy.\n\nIn the book Freire calls traditional pedagogy the &quot;banking model&quot; because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a piggybank. However, he argues for pedagogy to treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.\n\nAccording to Donaldo Macedo, a former colleague of Freire and University of Massachusetts professor, Pedagogy of the Oppressed is a revolutionary text, and people in totalitarian states risk punishment reading it[2]; Arizona's secretary of education, Tom Horne, objects to its use in classrooms.[3] The book has sold over 750 000 copies worldwide.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae75b8295bc89d2bcaf8de95a158d49376a7169","amp;dn":"Paulo+Freire+-+Pedagogy+of+the+Oppressed+%5BUnviolentPeaceMaker%5D+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae75b8295bc89d2bcaf8de95a158d49376a7169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,231,91,130,149,188,137,210,188,175,141,233,90,21,141,73,55,106,113,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
