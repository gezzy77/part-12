The Song Remains The Same\r\n102. Sick Again \r\n103. Nobody's Fault But Mine\r\n104. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n105. Since Ive Been Loving You\r\n106. No Quarter \r\n\r\nCD 2\r\n201. Ten Years Gone\r\n202. Battle Of Evermore\r\n203. Going To California\r\n204. Black Country Woman\r\n205. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\r\n206. White Summer\r\n207. Black Mountain Side\r\n208. Kashmir\r\n209. Trampled Underfoot\r\n\r\nCD 3\r\n301. Over The Top\r\n302. Jimmy Page (guitar/violin bow solo)\r\n303. Achilles Last Stand\r\n304. Stairway To Heaven\r\n305. Whole Lotta Love\r\n306. Rock And Roll\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nAn excellent show ... a famous Badge Holders show due to Plant's several \r\ndedications to the badge holder people ... with the whole band firing on \r\nall cylinders! It is the only known show from 1977 tour when the band \r\nstopped after the first song. The peculiar stop is brief and Robert \r\ndoesn't offer any hints. Perhaps a guitar change was neccessary. Jimmy's \r\nsoloing during Since I've Been Loving You, Achilles Last Stand, and Ten \r\nYears Gone in particular, is amazing. Keith Moon joins in to make this \r\nalready classic show legendary in stature. Just listen for a very crazed \r\nsounding yelling over the beginning of Bonham's drum solo: &quot;The best rock \r\nand roll drummer in the world ... living today! Mr John Bonham! With Buddy \r\nRich's arms!&quot; He says more after that, but I can never quite make out just \r\nwhat it is because he seems to trail off into a noise of swearing and \r\nyelling, which conjures up cartoon images of the Tazmanian Devil or even \r\n(perhaps more appropriately) Animal from the Muppets. But that's Keith Moon \r\nfor you! He also appeared before the encores. &quot;LA. It's been very funny. \r\nGood night!&quot; and the show was over","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab38f1f3c71cc245347a4ae89ed31f5ea11c1ead","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.06.23+Los+Angeles%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab38f1f3c71cc245347a4ae89ed31f5ea11c1ead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,56,241,243,199,28,194,69,52,122,74,232,158,211,31,94,161,28,30,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
