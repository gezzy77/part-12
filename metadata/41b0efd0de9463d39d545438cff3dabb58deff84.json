Although band founder Peter Green\nnamed the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates\n[Fleetwood, McVie] from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie\nplayed neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he\ninitially decided to stay with Mayall. The keyboardist, Christine McVie,\nwho joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all\nbut two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also\nsupplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\n\n\nAlbum Title: Greatest Hits\nArtist | Group: Fleetwood Mac\nLabel: CBS Music\nRelease date: 1989\nGenre: Rock / Blues / Blues Rock\nNumber of track(s): 12\nFile format: flac\nTotal duration: 00h:43m:27s:931ms\nTotal size: 204.1224 MB\n\n\n01 - The Green Manalishi [With The Two Pronged Crown] - [4mn 36s ]  [ 714 Kbps ][ 23.7 MiB ]\n02 - Oh Well - Part 1 - [3mn 32s ]  [ 614 Kbps ][ 15.7 MiB ]\n03 - Oh Well - Part 2 - [5mn 43s ]  [ 537 Kbps ][ 22.1 MiB ]\n04 - Shake Your Money Maker - [2mn 56s ]  [ 782 Kbps ][ 16.6 MiB ]\n05 - Need Your Love So Bad - [3mn 56s ]  [ 702 Kbps ][ 20.0 MiB ]\n06 - Rattle Snake Shake - [3mn 31s ]  [ 774 Kbps ][ 19.7 MiB ]\n07 - Dragonfly - [2mn 48s ]  [ 624 Kbps ][ 12.7 MiB ]\n08 - Black Magic Woman - [2mn 53s ]  [ 678 Kbps ][ 14.2 MiB ]\n09 - Albatross - [3mn 9s ]  [ 540 Kbps ][ 12.4 MiB ]\n10 - Man Of The World - [2mn 52s ]  [ 559 Kbps ][ 11.6 MiB ]\n11 - Stop Messin' Round - [2mn 21s ]  [ 738 Kbps ][ 12.6 MiB ]\n12 - Love That Burns - [5mn 4s ]  [ 629 Kbps ][ 23.0 MiB ]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b0efd0de9463d39d545438cff3dabb58deff84","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Greatest+Hits+1989+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b0efd0de9463d39d545438cff3dabb58deff84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,176,239,208,222,148,99,211,157,84,84,56,207,243,218,187,88,222,255,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
