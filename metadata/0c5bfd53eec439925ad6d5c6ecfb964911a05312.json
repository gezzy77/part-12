She digs in and wails as he cranks out chords and\ntaps furiously on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anchor Point,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and her assured rhythmic sensibility works\nquite well here and throughout the well-paced disc. While her sound doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\nundergo as many outward transformations as FrithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s does, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart,\nadaptable, and plays with good humor. Hear her range on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t HideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: its\nsweet drone wash cedes to one of FrithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderfully obsessive\ntapping/arpeggiating cycles, to which Anker responds with first echolalia and\nthen sour alto birdcalls. Frith plays with loops, layers of nasty distortion,\nmetallic scrambles, and buzzing hives of noise, and amidst it all, Anker sounds\nlike some kind of shaman attempting to communicate with the cosmic realities of\nhis guitar (except for those times when she sounds like sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to tame\nits beastliness, as on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reasonably Available Control MeasuresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nconsiderable sonic and textural range here, from tart lyricism to relative calm\nto gentle lapping percussion, and in any case things are never merely\nnoisy. Amidst its flinty, choked-off plucking and darting tenor, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mountain\nis as Quiet as the Eternal PastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ manages to get quite folkish in places. There\nis drifting tonality, wafting electricity, singing feedback and circular\nbreathing on tunes like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Same DirtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hallucinating Angels,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ great\nwhorls of sound take shape around your head. And perhaps best of all is the\nunpredictable Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thief Breaks Into an Empty House,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with flute tones and\nelectronics whizzing about, furtive and slashing at once.\n\n[...]\n\n--\n\nBy John Fordham &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/26/fred-frith-lotte-anker-review-jazz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/26/fred-frith-lotte-anker-review-jazz&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tor HammerÃƒÂ¸ (no) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torhammero.blogg.no/1420771840_fri_frith.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torhammero.blogg.no/1420771840_fri_frith.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Julia Neupert (de) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swr.de/swr2/musik/cd-tipps/the-edge-of-the-light-anker-frith/-/id=12628344/did=14924782/nid=12628344/8pwcuz/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swr.de/swr2/musik/cd-tipps/the-edge-of-the-light-anker-frith/-/id=12628344/did=14924782/nid=12628344/8pwcuz/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDi Marco Maiocco (it)\n\nPar Pierre Tenne (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.djamlarevue.com/lotte-anker-fred-frith-edge-of-the-light/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.djamlarevue.com/lotte-anker-fred-frith-edge-of-the-light/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5bfd53eec439925ad6d5c6ecfb964911a05312","amp;dn":"Lotte+Anker%2C+Fred+Frith+-+Edge+of+the+Light+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5bfd53eec439925ad6d5c6ecfb964911a05312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,91,253,83,238,196,57,146,90,214,213,198,236,251,150,73,17,160,83,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
