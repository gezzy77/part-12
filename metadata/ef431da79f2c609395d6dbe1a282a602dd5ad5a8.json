Coelho, B.D. Ribeiro (RSC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84973-816-3\r\n\r\nWhite biotechnology is the use of enzymes and microorganisms in industrial production through applied biocatalysis. This allows for milder reaction conditions (pH and temperature) and the use of more environmentally-compatible catalysts and solvents. This, in turn, leads to processes which are shorter, generate less waste, making them both environmentally and economically more attractive than conventional routes.\r\n\r\nThis book describes the use of white biotechnology within the sustainable chemistry concept, covering waste minimization; the use of alternative solvents (supercritical fluids, pressurized gases, ionic liquids and micellar systems) and energies (microwaves and ultrasound); sustainable approaches for the production of fine and bulk chemicals (aromas, polymers, pharmaceuticals and enzymes); the use of renewable resources and agro-industrial residues; and biocatalysts recycling.\r\n\r\nCovering industrial processes and new technologies, this book combines expertise from academia and industry. It is a valuable resource for researchers and industrialists working in biotechnology, green chemistry and sustainability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef431da79f2c609395d6dbe1a282a602dd5ad5a8","amp;dn":"White+Biotechnology+for+Sustainable+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef431da79f2c609395d6dbe1a282a602dd5ad5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,67,29,167,159,44,96,147,149,214,219,225,162,130,166,2,221,90,213,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
