But the TaskforceÃ¢â‚¬â€a clandestine team operating outside of US law to protect the country from terrorismÃ¢â‚¬â€gets wind of an assassination attempt on the American envoy sent to solidify the treaty. The Taskforce must devote every resource to saving his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and preventing another bloody outbreak of violence.\n\nTaskforce operator Pike Logan and his partner, Jennifer Cahill, are charged with following the assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flimsy trail through the Middle East, a trail that becomes more muddled at every turn. They must contend with terrorist organizations, independent killers, and shaky allies to uncover the biggest threat of all: an American citizen hiding a secret that just may destroy everything, including the Taskforce.\n\nBrad Taylor is the complete package: a writer who understands how to tell a thrilling story, who possesses the knowledge to construct an intricate and utterly believable plot, and who has more than enough on-the-ground experience to back it up. His first two books appeared on bestseller lists nationwide, including The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, and USA Today. Propulsive and compelling, Enemy of Mine is sure to join them.\n\n---\n\nMOBI (ARC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99615ffbde39b709d1a02d3b7f9f98e65f340713","amp;dn":"Enemy+of+Mine+by+Brad+Taylor+%28ARC%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99615ffbde39b709d1a02d3b7f9f98e65f340713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,97,95,251,222,57,183,9,209,160,45,59,127,159,152,230,95,52,7,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
