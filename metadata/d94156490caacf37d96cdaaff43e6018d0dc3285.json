(Wiley-VCH, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nPolysaccharide nanocrystals, an emerging green nanoingredient (nanomaterial) with high crystallinity obtained by acid hydrolysis of biomass-based polysaccharides, are of scientific and economic significance owing to their abundance, biodegradation potential, and fascinating functional performance. This versatile class of materials can be used in nanocomposites such as rubber or polyester, and in functional materials such as drug carriers, bio-inspired mechanically adaptive materials or membranes, to name but a few.\r\nThis book encompasses the extraction, structure, properties, surface modification, theory, and mechanism of diverse functional systems derived from polysaccharide nanocrystals.\r\nThis highly sought-after trendy book is currently the only monograph devoted to the most current knowledge pertaining to this exciting subject area. It is ideal for researchers and stakeholders who wish to broaden and deepen their knowledge in the fast-moving and rapidly expanding R&amp;D field of polymeric materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94156490caacf37d96cdaaff43e6018d0dc3285","amp;dn":"Polysaccharide-Based+Nanocrystals+-+Chemistry+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94156490caacf37d96cdaaff43e6018d0dc3285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,65,86,73,12,170,207,55,217,108,218,175,244,62,96,24,208,220,50,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
