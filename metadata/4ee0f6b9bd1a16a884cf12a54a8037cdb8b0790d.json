It's time to listen to reason! There's no doubt that Logic Demystified will help you master this challenging subject.\r\n\r\nWritten in a step-by-step format, this practical guide begins by covering arguments, validity, and truth tables. You'll move on to propositional and predicate logic, rigor, fallacies, paradoxes, and revelations. Proofs, Boolean algebra, the logic of machines, and sets are discussed as is the illogic of time, matter, space, and chaos. Detailed examples and concise explanations make it easy to understand the material, and end-of-chapter quizzes and a final exam help reinforce learning.\r\n\r\nIt's a no-brainer! You'll get:\r\n\r\nRules for reasoning\r\nQuantified statements and theorems\r\nSimple and classical paradoxes\r\nStrategies for proofs\r\nBasic set theory and machine logic\r\nA time-saving approach to performing better on homework, an exam, or at work\r\nSimple enough for a beginner, but challenging enough for an advanced student, Logic Demystified helps you validate your knowledge of this multidisciplinary topic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee0f6b9bd1a16a884cf12a54a8037cdb8b0790d","amp;dn":"Logic+Demystified+-+Anthony+Boutelle%2C+Stan+Gibilisco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee0f6b9bd1a16a884cf12a54a8037cdb8b0790d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,224,246,185,189,26,22,168,132,207,18,165,74,128,55,205,184,176,121,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
