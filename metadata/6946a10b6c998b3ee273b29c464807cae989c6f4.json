Neotopia's answer: the secret Super Dimensional Guard and their defenders, the Gundam Force. Led by Captain Gundam, the Gundam Force and its team of Gundams with special abilities are aided by a boy named Shute as they stop at nothing to defend the land from the Dark Axis and to defeat them once and for all.\n\nSource: AnimeNewsNetwork.com's Anime EncyclopÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦dia\n__________________________________________________________\n\nBefore someone gets on my case about the opening for the initial 26 eps not being the official opening: I know. The videos did not include the intros for either season, and the 2nd season did not have the ending either (the exception to both of these being episode 52). I can't find any record of the song &quot;True&quot; by Shimokawa Mikuni being used as the opening for this show: it is the opening for Dragon Drive, but I found this video (which seems to be official despite the lack of documentation) and as I can't stand the official openings (and I can't find a clip of the second one), I used this one. Also, the ending for the 1st season is the dubbed one: I can't seem to find the japanese ones except for the final ending which you see in episode 52.\n\nI couldn't get my hands on too many of the japanese RAWs nor would I probably have been able to provide subtitles had I found them all, so the dub will have to do for now.\n\nA big thank-you to SDFANkysbeth on You.Tube for uploading the 2nd season so I could splice the videos together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6946a10b6c998b3ee273b29c464807cae989c6f4","amp;dn":"SD+Gundam+Force+-+Complete+Series+%28Episodes+1-52%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6946a10b6c998b3ee273b29c464807cae989c6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,70,161,11,108,153,139,62,226,115,178,156,70,72,7,202,233,137,198,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
