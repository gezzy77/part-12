It was published in Japan by Compile Heart on November 18, 2010 for the PlayStation 3.[4] It is the sequel to the 2007 game Record of Agarest War and the third game in the series.\n\nA patch via download allows for use of a PlayStation Move motion controller for certain mini-games.[5]\n\nThe Soul Breeding system receives a new additional feature with the implementation of a &quot;Dark Love&quot; ending which occurs if the relationship rate is low with the chosen mate. Rather than a happy wedding, the main character has a marriage with his bride for political interests and enters a loveless relationship to conceive a child, resulting in poor stats for the next protagonist.\n\nObs.
