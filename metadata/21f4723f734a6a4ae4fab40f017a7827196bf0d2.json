The almost restrained  \n           &quot;Sydney&quot; falls into the latter category, its reflective lyric adding another        \n           dimension to the band's usually testosterone-driven songwriting. And it's by no     \n           means alone here, being immediately followed by &quot;Time Flies,&quot; an extended exercise  \n           in surprising sensitivity.                                                          \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Away from me                [03:59]                                        \n                 02.Heel over head              [04:05]                                        \n                 03.Nothing left to lose        [04:30]                                        \n                 04.Change my mind              [04:20]                                        \n                 05.Spin you around             [04:27]                                        \n                 06.Already gone                [04:31]                                        \n                 07.Think                       [04:11]                                        \n                 08.Cloud 9                     [03:34]                                        \n                 09.Bottom                      [05:22]                                        \n                 10.Freak of the world          [03:36]                                        \n                 11.Sydney                      [04:57]                                        \n                 12.Time flies                  [07:03]                                        \n                                                       ____                         /\n                                                                                     \n                             \t\t\t\t54:35 min\t\t    \n                         \t\t\t\t 89,2 MB\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f4723f734a6a4ae4fab40f017a7827196bf0d2","amp;dn":"Puddle_Of_Mudd-Life_On_Display-%28Retail%29-2003-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f4723f734a6a4ae4fab40f017a7827196bf0d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,244,114,63,115,74,106,74,228,250,180,15,1,122,120,39,25,107,240,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
