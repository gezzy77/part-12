With his usual determination, Finardi tackles social issues, public and private, falling a few times in the banality of morality, from rock songs with delicate melodies.\nThe album starts immediately with an electric rock, which tells us about the rapid ritms of modern society, that leaves no personal space, consumism and materialism of contemporary (Tutto subito). Scuola education is a critical institutionalization of knowledge. Zucchero and not in the heart are love songs , hymns to love; Giai Phong is a political manifesto against American imperialism. The frenetic title track (Diesel) highlights the soul of jazz musicians; Si puo vivere anche a Milano takes up the theme of the frenetic life, this time, in particular, in Milan. Very interesting Non diventare grande mai, not an invitation to submit passively to the rules of the adults and not being influenced by the powerful. But one of the high points of the album is the final Scimmia, one of the most dramatic pieces on drug compounds in Italy.
