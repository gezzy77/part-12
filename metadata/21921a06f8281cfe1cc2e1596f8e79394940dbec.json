Stray bills flutter behind you as you make a mad dash for the elevators. When you get to the roof a teammate jumps on the zip-line, but you choose a more direct route and swan-dive over the edge of the building. Your chute deploys. Bullets are whizzing far too close for comfort. The moment you hit the pavement itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a straight-out sprint to the getaway van. Sirens are blaring. Cops are on the way. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when you notice the massive crane crashing down. This is just a day in the life of the Battlefield Hardline player.\n\nIf you want to join your friends at the crime scene, you absolutely need to add the Battlefield Hardline Digital Deluxe Edition to your game library. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hit the streets with ten solid weeks of content that will keep that multiplayer rush going Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including new weapons, gear, and customization options. And each week, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get a new Battlepack to open.\n\nFeatures\nDramatic cops vs. criminals campaign. Crafted by the storytellers at Visceral, developers of the Dead Space trilogy, HardlineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single-player story puts you in the shoes of detective Nick Mendoza in an episodic crime drama. Lead your crew and employ new tactics to gather intel, obtain warrants, and make non-lethal arrests.\n\nRelease sizeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦:37.00GB\nRepacked size Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.:26.90GB\nvideosÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦:Lossless\naudioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.:Lossless\ntextureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦..:Lossless\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ OS: Windows Vista SP2 64-bit (with KB971512 update)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Processor: Athlon II/Phenom II 2.8 GHz, Intel Core I3/I5 2.4GHz\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Memory: 4 GB\n\nRecommended System Requirements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ OS: Windows 8 64-bit (with KB971512 update)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Processor: Intel Quad-Core CPU, AMD Six-Core CPU\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Memory: 8 GB RAM\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Graphics Card: AMD 290, Nvidia GTX760\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Graphics Memory: 3 GB\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hard Drive: 50 GB\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ DirectX: 11.0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21921a06f8281cfe1cc2e1596f8e79394940dbec","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Hardline+%5BDZ+RePack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21921a06f8281cfe1cc2e1596f8e79394940dbec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,146,26,6,248,40,28,254,28,194,225,89,111,142,121,57,73,64,219,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
