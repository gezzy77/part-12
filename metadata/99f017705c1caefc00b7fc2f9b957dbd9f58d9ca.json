Because of a complicated situation he needs a mate so he can qualify as king of the land. The 3-foot-tall despot has already banished all the fairy tale characters from his land, resulting in a diaspora of familiar bedtime figures.\n\nShrek (Mike Myers) and the obnoxious Donkey (Eddie Murphy) factor in when Farquaad concludes that he needs dragon-slaying assistance. The woman he wants is the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who's imprisoned in a castle by said dragon. To cut a deal to keep his house, the antisocial Shrek accepts the mission, except he falls in love with the princess he's been ordered to find!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f017705c1caefc00b7fc2f9b957dbd9f58d9ca","amp;dn":"SHRECK+THE+1ST-2001+AAC+H.264+BY+WINKER%40KIDZCORNER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f017705c1caefc00b7fc2f9b957dbd9f58d9ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,240,23,112,92,28,174,252,0,183,252,47,155,149,125,189,159,88,217,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
