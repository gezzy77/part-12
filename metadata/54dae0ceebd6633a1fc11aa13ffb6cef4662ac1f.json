The record established him as a major commercial force, and as one of the most recognizable voices of the 1980s. Although the major hits here, &quot;Sussudio,&quot; &quot;One More Night,&quot; &quot;Who Said I Would,&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Lose My Number&quot; quickly came to sound dated, the album contains several standout tracks. &quot;Long Long Way to Go,&quot; which features a cameo by Sting, is one of Collins&amp;#039; most effective ballads, while the pulsating &quot;Take Me Home&quot; utilizes the drama of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; on a more wistful track. &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot; and &quot;Inside Out,&quot; meanwhile, show an effective aggressive side to the singer. It&amp;#039;s not a completely satisfying recording, but it is the best example of one of the most dominating and influential styles of the 1980s. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Sussudio  [4:23]\n02 - Only You Know and I Know  [4:20]\n03 - Long Long Way to Go  [4:20]\n04 - I Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Know  [4:12]\n05 - One More Night  [4:47]\n06 - Don&amp;#039;t Lose My Number  [4:46]\n07 - Who Said I Would  [4:01]\n08 - Doesn&amp;#039;t Anybody Stay Together Anymore  [4:18]\n09 - Inside Out  [5:14]\n10 - Take Me Home  [5:51]\n11 - We Said Hello, Goodbye (Don&amp;#039;t Look Back)  [4:15]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54dae0ceebd6633a1fc11aa13ffb6cef4662ac1f","amp;dn":"Phil+Collins+-+No+Jacket+Required+%281985%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54dae0ceebd6633a1fc11aa13ffb6cef4662ac1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,218,224,206,235,214,99,58,31,193,26,161,63,251,108,239,70,98,172,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
