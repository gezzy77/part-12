It is... SacrÃƒâ€° Bleu.\nIn July 1890, Vincent van Gogh went into a cornfield and shot himself. Or did he? Why would an artist at the height of his creative powers attempt to take his life... and then walk a mile to a doctor's house for help? Who was the crooked little &quot;color man&quot; Vincent had claimed was stalking him across France? And why had the painter recently become deathly afraid of a certain shade of blue?\nThese are just a few of the questions confronting Vincent's friends - baker-turned-painter Lucien Lessard and bon vivant Henri Toulouse-Lautrec - who vow to discover the truth of van Gogh's untimely death. Their quest will lead them on a surreal odyssey and brothel-crawl deep into the art world of late 19th century Paris.\nOh la la, quelle surprise, and zut alors! A delectable confection of intrigue, passion, and art history - with cancan girls, baguettes, and fine French cognac thrown in for good measure - Sacre Bleu is another masterpiece of wit and wonder from the one, the only, Christopher Moore.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb030dba296e8bbec94cdd7bcca2b55d58b00e5e","amp;dn":"Moore%2C+Christopher+-+Sacre+Bleu+%28Unabridged%29+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb030dba296e8bbec94cdd7bcca2b55d58b00e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,3,13,186,41,110,139,190,201,76,221,123,204,162,181,93,88,176,14,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
