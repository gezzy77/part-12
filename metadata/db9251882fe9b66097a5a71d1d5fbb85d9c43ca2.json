He meets up with a group of overly charitable paper boys who want him to sub for their friend while he's out of town. Gunther agrees so he can get enough money for concert tickets to take his blonde and beautiful crush too, all the while dealing with Chad, her wannabe boyfriend and his bully friends. All in all, Gunther learns to respect himself and other people and to have fun during it all.\n\n\nCode: Select all\n        ..::Specs::..\nFilesize............: 699.16 MB\nRuntime.............: 1:14:51\n        ..::Video::..\nResolution..........: 720x416\nCodec...............: XVID\nAspect Ratio........: 1.731 (16/9)\nBitrate.............: 2303 kBit/s\nFrame Rate..........: 29.97 Frames/Second\n        ..::Audio::..\nCodec...............: MPEG-1, Layer 3\nBitrate.............: 110 kBit/s\nChannels............: 2 (Stereo)\nSamplerate..........: 48.000 kHz\nLanguage............: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9251882fe9b66097a5a71d1d5fbb85d9c43ca2","amp;dn":"Gunther.And.The.Paper.Brigade.%281996%29.DVDRip.XviD-classicDCOMs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9251882fe9b66097a5a71d1d5fbb85d9c43ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,146,81,136,47,233,182,96,151,165,167,29,29,95,187,133,217,196,60,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
