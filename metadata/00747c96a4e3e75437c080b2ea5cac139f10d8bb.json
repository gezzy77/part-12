Andrew's second attempt began on 11 January 2007 and ended on 12 February when the search for his missing body was called off following the recovery of his partly flooded kayak on 10 February just 30 nautical miles short of his destination Milford Sound.\n\nThe sleeping arrangements at sea involved deploying a sea anchor, squeezing his body down into the kayak and sealing the hatch with a bulbous fibreglass capsule (dubbed &quot;Casper&quot;) fitted with an air-only ventilator which, with its self-righting capabilities, made it possible to ride out the most severe storm conditions that are inevitable in that part of the ocean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00747c96a4e3e75437c080b2ea5cac139f10d8bb","amp;dn":"Solo+-+Lost+at+Sea+%28English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00747c96a4e3e75437c080b2ea5cac139f10d8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,116,124,150,164,227,231,84,55,192,128,178,234,92,172,19,159,16,216,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
