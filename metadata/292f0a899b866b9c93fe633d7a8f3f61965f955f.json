A small grey cartridge with a rather misrepresentative cover art. At that moment, six other children, of varied statures and geographical locales, were also given these cartridges, and thus their grooming began. Sixteen years later, in the middle of the state of volunteers and under the tutelage of Doug Mitchell, their paths converged, their fates were made known, and their assembly was made complete.\n\n       ---------------------------\n\n1   Hope Ride Alone                  5:08\n2   Funeral for a Son                2:37\n3   Unrest in the House of Light     3:31\n4   The Will of One                  4:09\n5   Vengeance                        3:16\n6   The Stand (Man or Machine)       5:57\n7   The Sons of Fate                 8:12\n8   Due vendetta                     4:03\n\n\t\t\t    TOTAL   36:13\n       ---------------------------\n\nPlease seed!
