The archive is organized by author and could be used for backup, offline reading, or data mining.\n\nNote that the archive contains a large number of files. Unzipping it to your file system may not be necessary if the archive is to be used together with some application. If you are a developer, reading directly from the ZIP-file may be preferable.\n\nA new version will be released each season via BitTorrent, approximately once every three months. When suitable, an xdelta3 patch will also be provided for users who do not wish to redownload unchanged stories.\n\nThis torrent contains the complete archive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d684d814af85c3eae13a083e8c92b97b6f86e03d","amp;dn":"fimfarchive-20131015.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d684d814af85c3eae13a083e8c92b97b6f86e03d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,132,216,20,175,133,195,234,225,58,8,62,140,146,185,123,111,134,224,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
