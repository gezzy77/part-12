The band, comprised of frontman Lajon Witherspoon, John Connolly (guitar), Clint Lowery (guitar), Vince Hornsby (bass), and Morgan Rose (drums), first appeared in 1995 as Crawlspace, releasing the single &quot;My Ruin&quot; on the Mortal Kombat: More Kombat recording. Shortly thereafter, the group changed its name to Sevendust and released a self-titled debut in 1997. Two years later, the bandmates issued the gold-selling Home and played over 800 shows alongside such groups as Creed, along with a stop at Woodstock '99. Their angst-ridden third album, the aptly titled Animosity, appeared in fall 2001, and Seasons followed in 2003. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tmp3 320 CBR\nLabel:\t\t\tTVT Records\nCatalog:\t\tTV-6051-2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Black\n02.Bitch\n03.Too Close To Hate\n04.Denial\n05.Waffle (Tom Lord-Alge Mix)\n06.Assdrop\n07.Bender (Feat.
