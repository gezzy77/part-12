Released in the late '60s discord over Vietnam, in the wake of the controversial Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and the brutal &quot;spaghetti westerns&quot; of Sergio Leone, The Wild Bunch polarized critics and audiences over its ferocious bloodshed. One side hailed it as a classic appropriately pitched to the violence and nihilism of the times, while the other reviled it as depraved. After a failed payroll robbery, the outlaw Bunch, led by aging Pike Bishop (William Holden) and including Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), Angel (Jaime Sanchez), and Lyle and Tector Gorch (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson), heads for Mexico pursued by the gang of Pike's friend-turned-nemesis Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). Ultimately caught between the corruption of railroad fat cat Harrigan (Albert Dekker) and federale general Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), and without a frontier for escape, the Bunch opts for a final Pyrrhic victory, striding purposefully to confront Mapache and avenge their friend Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Warren Oates\r\nDIRECTOR......: Sam Peckinpah\r\nWRITERS.......: Walon Green, Sam Peckinpah\r\nGENRE.........: Western | Action\r\nRATING........: 8.0/10  62,640 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065214\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 24mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.99GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x788\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.40:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 3500 Kbps (3 pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English AC3+ 5.1 384bps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary by Nick Redman, Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons and David Weddle\r\nSOURCE........: Dikaja.banda.1969.VC-1.BDRemux.1080p-HDvOT\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, ENG-SDH\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-06-24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9c167ad94ef067b3414853b43333f63536b418","amp;dn":"The.Wild.Bunch.1969.1080p.BluRay.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9c167ad94ef067b3414853b43333f63536b418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,156,22,122,217,78,240,103,179,65,72,83,180,51,51,246,53,54,180,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
