The Priests, brothers Fathers Martin and Eugene OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hagan and Father David Delargy, were young school friends when they first sang together at the age of 12 (Martin and David) and 15 (Eugene). Their love of singing continued whilst studying for the priesthood in Rome. Once ordained, all three took up parish commitments. Singing was both part of prayer plus, in their spare time, they performed in local operas, musicals and choirs. In February 2008, a record company scout knocked on their door and asked them to make a demo. The rest, as they say is history. The Priests never allow their music commitments to stand in the way of their day jobs and parish obligations. The release of their first album The Priests lead to them being nominated for a Classical Brit. If that wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enough they have given one off performances to The President of Ireland, The Prince Of Wales and The Duchess Of Cornwall and last but no means least, Her Majesty The Queen.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] You'll Never Walk Alone\n[02] How Great Thou Art\n[03] Te Deum\n[04] Gaelic Blessing\n[05] Amazing Grace\n[06] When Thou Art Near (Bist Du Bei Mir)\n[07] Benedictus\n[08] Stabat Mater: 1.\n[09] Laudamus Te\n[10] Ave Verum Corpus, K. 618\n[11] King Of Kings\n[12] Lift Thine Eyes (Elijah)\n[13] Silent Night\n[14] The Lords Prayer\n[15] BÃƒÆ’Ã…â€™ ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€™osa im Chroise\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:43m:30s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 111mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I- Tunes v9.0.1.8 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Classical\nRelease Date\t&gt; 23 November 2009\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepriests.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepriests.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Priests&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Priests&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.songlyrics.com/the-priests-lyrics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.songlyrics.com/the-priests-lyrics&lt;/a&gt; \n[Harmony TV Ad]\n[Amazing Grace]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ce0e0f046b885db2bc781203157d45ea4eb4d3","amp;dn":"%5B2009%5D+Harmony+-+The+Priests+111mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ce0e0f046b885db2bc781203157d45ea4eb4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,206,14,15,4,107,136,93,178,188,120,18,3,21,125,69,234,78,180,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
