The recording is a very\r\ngood balanced professional board tape.\r\n\r\nAudience Source:\r\nIncomplete good to very good 1st audience recording. The recording is clear \r\nand fairly close to the stage with very little audience disturbance and some \r\nrather short tape distortion in places. There is bass distortion throughout \r\nthe set and is notably intense in the pieces where Jonesy plays bass pedals.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nAll tracks completely from the sbd except were noted\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01. Rock And Roll*\r\n02. Sick Again \r\n03. Over The Hills And Far Away \r\n04. In My Time Of Dying \r\n05. Since I've Been Loving You \r\n06. The Song Remains The Same \r\n07. The Rain Song* \r\n \r\nDisc 2\r\n01. Kashmir*\r\n02. No Quarter \r\n03. Trampled Underfoot* \r\n04. Moby Dick \r\n\r\nDisc 3\r\n01. Dazed And Confused* \r\n02. Stairway To Heaven* \r\n03. Whole Lotta Love \r\n04. Out On The Tiles (intro)/Black Dog \r\n05. Heartbreaker* \r\n\r\n* patched with audience recording\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis is a magical show ... one of the best from 1975! The Valentine's Day \r\nreflected Plant to some special comments tonight about the Pagans: &quot;Today \r\nis one of the last of the pagan traditions that is carried on into the 20th \r\nCentury. It's the day for sowing the wild seeds. In fact, now they call it \r\nSt. Valentine's Day ... so, happy St. Valentine's Day. I think we should \r\ndedicate this show to St. Valentine.&quot; Since I've Been Loving You is played \r\nfor the first time out of three on this tour and the playing and energy of \r\nthis show make it a real special concert. Plant: &quot;Who knows what it's gonna \r\nsound like, but it's something we really used to dig playing.&quot; No Quarter \r\nis great and Dazed And Confused is beyond words. The encores are funky and \r\nlong, and the rare second encore of Heartbreaker has a long blues interlude \r\ninserted in Jimmy's solo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb2367324cd382631fc7896ed90d5be9f462604","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.02.14+Uniondale%2C+New+York+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb2367324cd382631fc7896ed90d5be9f462604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,178,54,115,36,205,56,38,49,252,120,150,237,144,213,190,159,70,38,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
