The serial, produced as the twenty-third season of the Doctor Who television series, aired in weekly episodes from 6 September to 6 December 1986. The only Doctor Who presentation of its kind, it contains four mini-adventures, 'The Mysterious Planet', 'Mindwarp', 'Terror of the Vervoids' and ended with Colin Baker's final story 'The Ultimate Foe'.\n\nIn the serial, the Sixth Doctor is tried by the High Council of Time Lords for breaking several of the laws of Gallifrey, the Time Lords' home world, including interference with outside worlds and genocide. A mysterious character called the Valeyard acts as prosecutor. In the first two chapters ('The Mysterious Planet' and 'Mindwarp') events from the Doctor's past and present are submitted as evidence of his guilt. The third chapter ('Terror of the Vervoids') presents future events in the Doctor's defense. In the concluding chapter ('The Ultimate Foe') the Doctor's trial is halted, and the Doctor confronts the Valeyard and his old rival, the Master, in order to clear his name and to save the High Council.\n\nColin Baker makes his final appearance as the Doctor in this longest running serial before being fired by the BBC. Nicola Bryant departs as Peri Brown in Mindwarp. Bonnie Langford makes her debut as the Doctor's future companion Mel Bush in 'Terror of the Vervoids'.\n\nTotal Episodes: 14 (and they are back to 24 minutes again this season. That is why\n                    this torrent is so much smaller than the others.)\n\n01 - The Trial of a Time Lord - 'The Mysterious Planet' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is charged with breaking the First\n     Law of Time - a law forbidding interference in alien worlds - by the High\n     Council of Gallifrey. In his prosecution, the Valeyard (Michael Jayston)\n     presents the transgressions in the style of flashbacks on a video screen,\n     depicting the Doctor's past adventures with companion Peri Brown (Nicola\n     Bryant).\n\n02 - The Trial of a Time Lord - 'Mindwarp' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The Valeyard presents his second piece of evidence: The Doctor and\n     Peri's activities on Thoros Beta immediately before the trial. The flashback\n     shows the Doctor investigating arms sales, where he sees his old adversary\n     Sil (Nabil Shaban). Sil's race, the Mentors, are revealed to have been\n     supplying Yrcanos (Brian Blessed), the local king of a primitive culture,\n     with advanced weaponry. The Doctor is portrayed as self-serving and\n     unconcerned with PeriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s welfare during the flashback and it results in\n     disaster for his companion.\n\n03 - The Trial of a Time Lord - 'Terror of the Vervoids' - 4 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The Doctor is allowed to present evidence in his defense. He\n     chooses events from the future. But his defense gets him charged with\n     genocide as well.\n\n04 - The Trial of a Time Lord - 'The Ultimate Foe' - 2 Episodes\n\n     Synopsis: The trial comes to a head when The Doctor claims that the Matrix\n     has been altered, The Keeper of the Matrix (James Bree) is called to testify.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4415ffd30a126a648f2d4375f5a5deeab77f657c","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Season+23+-+%281986%29+-+14+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4415ffd30a126a648f2d4375f5a5deeab77f657c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,21,255,211,10,18,106,100,143,45,67,117,245,165,222,234,183,127,101,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
