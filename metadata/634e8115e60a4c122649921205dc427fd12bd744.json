They released a split album and their debut on Little Rose Productions in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2002 Immortal Souls signed with Dutch label Fear Dark which released their second and third album as well as a compilation. They have performed at Tuska Open Air Metal Festival. Their musical style is characterized by their use of melodic guitar riffs and singing which shifts between growls and shouting. Their music has been called winter metal since Immortal Souls utilizes frosty metaphors in their lyrics and usually creates a cold, wintry atmosphere. The album Wintereich was released in 2007 in Europe on Dark Balance and in the USA through Facedown Records.\n\nContents\n\n    1 History\n        1.1 Beginning\n        1.2 Doom metal perio\n    2 Music\n    3 Discography\n    4 Members\n        4.1 Current members\n        4.2 Former members\n    \n\nHistory\nEsa Sarkioja (Metalfest 2007, Bad Hersfeld, Germany)\nBeginning\n\nIn December 1991 Aki SÃƒÂ¤rkioja (bass, vocals) and Esa SÃƒÂ¤rkioja (guitar) founded Immortal Souls. During the years 1992-1994 Immortal Souls recorded some demo tapes including a tape called Vision of Hell (1993). These demos have never been officially published. In 1994, the drummer Antti Nykyri joined the band. At the end of January 1995 the band recorded a demo tape called Immortal Souls, which included six songs. 100 copies were made of the demo tape and it contained straightforward heavy metal with growl vocals. After the Immortal Souls demo, all of the band's album covers have had a wintry theme in the artwork. Nykyri left the band after one year due to other personal interests.\nDoom metal period\n\nDuring the years 1995-1996 Immortal Souls wrote new songs and shaped their musical style. At the time, the band members were interested in doom metal style, and with that influence they recorded their most depressing and oppressive demo called Reflections of Doom in November 1996. The most stylish output of the doom metal experiments was a song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Realm Of Hatred.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In the recording sessions Immortal Souls had to use a drum machine, because a new drummer Jupe Hakola was signed in a couple of months after the recording sessions. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hate SenderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was published in the TOB zine's 7- inch vinyl record. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“I`am MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was published later on the From Kaamos To Midnight Sun compilation album. Also songs &quot;Hate Sender&quot;, &quot;I am Me&quot; and &quot;Realm of Hatred&quot; were later published on the Once Upon A Time In The North compilation album as remastered versions.\nThe lyrics of Immortal Souls contain Christian themes, visual language based on the Nordic winter nature and sometimes on Finnish folklore.[4]\n\nTracklisting\n \t         11.
