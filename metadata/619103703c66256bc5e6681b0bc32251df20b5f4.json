Written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon (credited to LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney), the song was released as the A-side of their eleventh single. The single went to the number one spot in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, West Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Norway. On the US Billboard Hot 100, the song was at number one for two non-consecutive weeks, being interrupted by Frank Sinatra's &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. \n\n&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was the last new song by the Beatles to be featured on their final tour in 1966, and was the group's only U.S. number one released that year. \n\nThe track was recorded between 13 April and 14 April 1966. \n\n&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; is marked by the boosted bass guitar sound throughout, partly in response to John Lennon demanding to know why the bass on a certain Wilson Pickett record far exceeded the bass on any Beatles records. This changed with the &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; single. \n\n&quot;'Paperback Writer' was the first time the bass sound had been heard in all its excitement,&quot; said Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick in Mark Lewisohn's book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions. &quot;Paul played a different bass, a Rickenbacker. Then we boosted it further by using a loudspeaker as a microphone. We positioned it directly in front of the bass speaker and the moving diaphragm of the second speaker made the electric current.&quot; \n\nThe promotional film for the song, one of the first of its type, shot amongst ornate garden statuary, was directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who went on to direct the Beatles' final film, the documentary Let It Be.\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperback_Writer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperback_Writer&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DagbOaAGa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DagbOaAGa&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:02:25\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
