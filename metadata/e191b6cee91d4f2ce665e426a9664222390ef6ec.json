Yet the mainstream media have monolithically failed to ask elementary questions about anomalies in this story. So-called alternative media have been little better. Towers of Deception explains why and prescribes actions to break out the truth.\n\nAuthored by a lifelong journalist who was for thirty-five years a media critic, Towers of Deception provides twenty-six &quot;exhibits&quot; of evidence proving &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that 9/11 was an inside job. It then presents case histories of de facto censorship by mainstream media and examines the psychological phenomenon of denial. &quot;False flag&quot; operations and psychological warfare are dealt with in detail, as is the &quot;invisible government&quot;-the powers pulling strings behind the scenes. Following a profile of Dr. David Ray Griffin as an authentic prophet of the 9/11 truth movement, Towers of Deception urges people to speak truth to power and challenge all media.\n\nInterspersed with photographs, diary entries, and inspiring profiles of those who see 9/11 truth as the Achilles' heel of the neocon agenda, Towers of Deception includes a professional-quality DVD produced by the author: The Great Conspiracy: The 9/11 News Special You Never Saw.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e191b6cee91d4f2ce665e426a9664222390ef6ec","amp;dn":"Towers+of+Deception+-+The+Media+Cover-up+of+9-11+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e191b6cee91d4f2ce665e426a9664222390ef6ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,145,182,206,233,29,79,44,230,101,228,38,169,102,66,34,57,14,246,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
