Your erratic heartbeat and amplified breaths are all that escape the hostile stillness. Sweat beads down your face as an all too familiar vibration breaks your concentration. You turn to face the threat while the rookie lays down a wild burst of gunfire into the trees up ahead...\n\nExperience the danger, fear, and unpredictability of lethal jungle warfare against a cunning enemy in Vietcong, a first-person action shooter set during the infamous conflict in Southeast Asia. Command expertly trained members of the U.S. Special Forces on critical missions through dangerous territories. You are the leader of one of the finest fighting forces ever assembled. It's time to show the world what you're made of. \n\nSummary\n\nSet in the height of the Vietnam War (1965-1975), Vietcong is arguably the best Vietnam War game and offers a unique insight to jungle warfare.\n\nSingleplayer Campaign\n\nYou are a member of the U.S. Special Forces Sergeant First Class Steve R. Hawkins; born 13th October 1939, in Wilmington North Carolina, who has been assigned to the United States Special Forces camp at Nui Pek. Nui Pek is situated near where the Ho Chi Minh trail reenters Vietnam from Cambodia, so it is considered one of the most dangerous areas in all of Vietnam. Hawkins leads one of the special forces teams stationed at Nui Pek, each member of whom is a Sergeant in their own right, and has their own specialties.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIn addition to the Singleplayer Campaign, the game features several stand-alone single player maps and network and online multiplay. Multiplay game modes include capture the flag (CTF), Capture the flag with Bots, deathmatch (DM), team deathmatch (TDM), assault team game (ATG), cooperative game US(COOP), cooperative game VC (COOP_VC), Turn Table (TT), King of the Hill (KOTH), last man standing (LMS), and real war (RW). Nearly five years after the game's release, Vietcong as a multiplayer is still popular. There are still thousands of players around the globe playing in numerous servers.\n\nVietcong multiplayer requires jungle warfare strategies and tactics to outsmart the enemy. Camoflauge and stealth in the dense jungle maps available on multiplayer are a large part of the game. Other skills that are utilized by players are: hunting and tracking; sniping and counter-sniping; positioning and movement.\n\nDetails\n\nDeveloper(s): Pterodon\nIllusion Softworks \nPublisher(s): Gathering of Developers \nEngine: Ptero-Engine II \nPlatform(s): PC (Windows) \nRelease date(s): NA March 26, 2003\nPAL April 17, 2003\n \nGenre(s): Tactical first-person shooter \nMode(s): Singleplayer, Multiplayer \nRating(s): BBFC: 18\nESRB: Teen\n \nMedia: CD-ROM \n\nSystem Requirements                                                        \n                                                                             \n   Minimum                                                                   \n   700mhz Pentium 3 or 4 or AMD Athalon processor                            \n   16X CD Rom                                                                \n   1.8 GB free HD space                                                      \n   256 MB Ram                                                                \n   32 MB Video Card DirectX 8.1 compatible                                   \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n   Recommended                                                               \n   1GHZ Pentium 4 and AMD Athalon Processor                                  \n   32X CD Rom                                                                \n   1.8 GB free HD space                                                      \n   256+ MB Ram                                                               \n   64 MB video card with DirectX 8.1 compatible   \n\nReference &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietcong_(computer_game)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietcong_(computer_game)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pterodon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pterodon.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.pc.ign.com/articles/391/391712p1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.pc.ign.com/articles/391/391712p1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20722.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20722.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pterodon.com/?id=16&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pterodon.com/?id=16&lt;/a&gt;\n\n##########################################################################################################################################################################\n\nABOUT THIS TORRENT\n\nContains: \nVietcong - Patched to v1.60 (latest patch).\nFist Alpha Addon. \nNo-CD Crack.\n\nYOU DO NOT NEED A CD KEY TO PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE/MULTIPLAYER!\n\nHOW TO INSTALL\n\n1.
