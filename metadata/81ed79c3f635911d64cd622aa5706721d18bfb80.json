The United Nations has been in existence for more than a half-century but its origins and objectives remain misunderstood by many people of this world. The author makes clear that the Founders and the founding of the U.N. ought not be confused with the Founders and founding of the United States. The U.N., he reminds us, began with a semi-secret meeting between Roosevelt administration officials and British and Soviet delegates at Dumbarton Oaks, where plans were laid for a postwar security arrangement, built around an organization that would prevent future world wars. Aside from the fact that a red flag ought to have been raised regarding the outrageously utopian belief that big government, especially world government, could usher in a millennium of peace and freedom, a look at the players involved should have caused alarm bells to sound. Just ask yourself why the representatives of the mass-murdering Stalinist regime are given equal footing and a free hand in establishing a pro-peace/pro-democracy organization with global jurisdiction? Little wonder then that many of RooseveltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aids who were sent there were either Communists or strong Communist sympathizers. The second thing Bonta makes clear is that the U.N. was never intended to be a peace organization. He quotes constitutional authority J. Reuben Clark who made this observation at the time of the drafting of the Charter: &quot;The Charter is a war document not a peace document. It makes us a party to every international dispute arising anywhere in the world. The United Nations will not prevent future wars, but make it practically certain that we shall have future wars.&quot; In other words, the real purpose of the U.N. was to exploit incessant, orchestrated cries to &quot;keep the peace,&quot; &quot;save the environment,&quot; &quot;free the indigenous peoples&quot; and &quot;feed the poor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in order to erode national sovereignty and impose global government over a disarmed world. As for the WTO, ICC, NATO, NAFTA, FTAA and the Free Trade Zone of the Middle East, Bonta notes, few realize that these entities are recognized as regional arrangements under the U.N. Charter, and that they have written into their founding documents a submission to the will of the United Nations Security Council ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in other words, submission to the central institution of the U.N. system, where the only real power lies. And what of the U.N. Charter? This is BontaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next point; the Charter is not modeled after the U.S. Constitution, as is too often advertised. There is no true representation at the U.N.; all the officials are appointed, not elected. There is no separation of powers, or checks and balances; all power ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ legislative, executive and even judicial ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ resides in a worldwide Security Council of 15 individuals (five of whom possess absolute veto power). There is no limited government; the Charter outlines all of its powers in sweeping, vague, open-ended language. There are no God-given inalienable rights; the U.N.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Declaration of Rights reads like a reprint of the old Soviet constitution, with every human right being subject to revocation when exercised inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. Inside the United Nations goes beyond the public relations campaign to examine the hard reality of its system and its dangerous objectives. For the uninitiated in the history and purposes of the United Nations, this brief but informative work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ full of nuts-and-bolts basics about the U.N., its shady founding, its flawed principles, its radical goals and its awful performance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is just the right place to begin. Find out how you aren&amp;#039;t going to elect no representatives and absolutely no president of the upcomming world government as they will simply be appointed by the shadowy guys you&amp;#039;ve never heard about. 135 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ed79c3f635911d64cd622aa5706721d18bfb80","amp;dn":"Bonta-Inside+United+Nations-A+Critical+Look+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ed79c3f635911d64cd622aa5706721d18bfb80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,237,121,195,246,53,145,29,100,205,98,42,165,112,103,33,209,139,251,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
