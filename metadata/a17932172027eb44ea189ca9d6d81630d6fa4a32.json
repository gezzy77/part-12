You will also want to\nallow setup to download updates during upgrade process.\n-Completely re-designed integration sources and methods to hopefully\neliminate any install failure problems.\n\nComments:\n-Previous v3 release still seemed to have an install error bug at about 85ish\npercent mark. I redesigned everything about my integration and source handling\nto hopefully eliminate this bug.\n-In computer software often it's unseen bugs that aren't present in the source\ncode that can cause problems. I believe there was something that, although\nshouldn't have resulted in errors, just wasn't working as intended with my\nprevious integration methods.\n-I've also got a few complaints about the missing sxs folder, so I put that\nback in. I would still recommend against using /limitaccess when adding\nfeatures.\n-On top of that I threw in my diskpart script, now with existing partition\nsupport. It doesn't run by default, but if you open command prompt during setup\nshift-f10 and type &quot;X:MENU&quot; you will start the script.\n-Default boot memory settings restored\n\nmurphy78 Setup Script features:\n-Shift-F10 during setup to open CMD prompt and X:MENU to start\n-Multi-Boot, Fast Setup, Add drivers to PE environment, Add drivers to\npost-install offline image, Recovery image partition, Fully ESD compatible,\nsplit-wim compatible, No Extra system partition option for MBR users.\n-You can even shrink your recovery image after install and resize your\npartitions, though I haven't automated that part. You would just assign\na drive letter to the recovery partition, copy/paste the install.wim to your\nsystem drive and export the image to an install.esd using recovery compress.\nThen you point reagentc at the osimage again.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - AutoKMS Activator from MTK 2.5.1\nmurphy78 - Testing, ISO design, diskpart/apply script\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78-TPB/MDL :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17932172027eb44ea189ca9d6d81630d6fa4a32","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+20in1+with+Update+x64+en-US+Apr2014+v4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17932172027eb44ea189ca9d6d81630d6fa4a32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,121,50,23,32,39,235,68,234,24,156,169,214,216,22,48,214,250,74,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
