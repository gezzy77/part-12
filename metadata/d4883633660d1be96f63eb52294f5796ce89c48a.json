And if you understand the word problem but have no idea\nwhere to begin with the math, again, you will not do well.\n\nThe Ultimate Physics Tutor is a complete Physics course that begins at the very beginning assuming the student has never seen a physics equation.\nThe course then proceeds to introduce new topics in an easy-to-understand fashion. The course is a 2 DVD series, 11 full hours in duration, and\ncontains 24 chapters of material so you can be assured that all of the core topics are covered in detail. What sets this DVD apart from the rest\nis that the concepts are taught entirely through example problems. The easiest way to learn Physics is to work problems as you learn the material\n- and that is exactly what this 2 DVD series provides. You will immediately improve your problem-solving skills which will help on homework and\nexams, and you will have a reference for many of the commonly asked problems in Physics. If you have a problem with your homework, simply find a\nsimilar problem fully worked on the Ultimate Physics Tutor! \n\nLength: 11 hours\nProduct Link: http://www.mathtutordvd.com/products/item12.cfm\n\n205M\t01.Velocity.and.Acceleration.In.One.Dimension.avi\n106M\t02.Equations.of.Motion.In.One.Dimension.avi\n191M\t03.Scalars.and.Vectors.avi\n161M\t04.Projectile.Motion.avi\n225M\t05.Newtons.Laws.of.Motion.avi\n135M\t06.Newtons.Laws.of.Motion.With.Friction.avi\n66M\t07.Work.avi\n134M\t08.Kinetic.Energy.and.the.Work.Energy.Theorem.avi\n199M\t09.Potential.Energy.and.Energy.Conservation.avi\n102M\t10.Power.avi\n140M\t11.Momentum.and.Impulse.avi\n76M\t12.Conservation.of.Momentum.avi\n214M\t13.Inelastic.and.Elastic.Collisions.avi\n134M\t14.Angular.Speed.and.Angular.Acceleration.avi\n143M\t15.Rotational.Equations.of.Motion.avi\n136M\t16.Tangental.Speed.and.Centripetal.Force.avi\n157M\t17.Gravitation.And.Keplers.Laws.Of.Motion.avi\n62M\t18.Torque.avi\n41M\t19.Rotational.Equilibrium.avi\n118M\t20.Angular.Acceleration.and.Moment.of.Inertia.avi\n72M\t21.Rotational.Kinetic.Energy.and.Angular.Momentum.avi\n63M\t22.Density.and.Pressure.avi\n133M\t23.The.Buoyant.Force.avi\n125M\t24.The.Bernoulli.Equation.avi\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4883633660d1be96f63eb52294f5796ce89c48a","amp;dn":"Math.Tutor.DVD.Physics.1.Newtonian.Motion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4883633660d1be96f63eb52294f5796ce89c48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,136,54,51,102,13,27,233,111,99,235,82,41,79,87,150,206,137,196,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
