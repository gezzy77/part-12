Throughout America, there were numbers of teenage girls dressing like Lauper and using &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; as an anthem, a call to arms for self-expression. At first, her music was a bright, colorful new wave fusion of a number of styles, including new wave, post-punk, reggae, pop, and funk. Both her music and her appearance helped popularize -- and just as importantly, sanitize --- the image of punk and new wave for America, making it an acceptable part of the pop landscape. Lauper didn't follow through on the success of her debut, choosing to turn toward middle-of-the-road balladry and mainstream pop, but her first album remains a benchmark of the early '80s.\n\n\nArtist...............: Cyndi Lauper\nAlbum................: She's So Unusual A 30th Anniversary Celebration (2014)\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/21/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Money Changes Everything\n02.Girls Just Want To Have Fun\n03.When You Were Mine\n04.Time After Time\n05.She Bop\n06.All Through The Night\n07.Witness\n08.I'll Kiss You\n09.He's So Unusual\n10.Yeah Yeah\n11.Girls Just Want To Have Fun (2013 Yolanda Be Cool Remix)\n12.Time After Time (2013 Nervo Back In Time Remix)\n13.Time After Time (2013 Bent Collective Remix)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Girls Just Want To Have Fun (Early Guitar Demo)\n02.All Through The Night (1983 Rehearsal, With Studio Dialogue)\n03.Rules And Regulations (1983 Rehearsal)\n04.Money Changes Everything (Demo)\n05.Girls Just Want To Have Fun (Demo)\n06.Right Track, Wrong Train (Non-LP B-Side)\n07.Witness (Live Boston 1984)\n08.She Bop (1984 Arthur Baker Remix)\n09.Time After Time (Work In Progress Rough Mix)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df0e9d93ce9a7888a10c0e503746938b25584d1","amp;dn":"Cyndi+Lauper+-+She%27s+So+Unusual+30th+Anniversary+%282014%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df0e9d93ce9a7888a10c0e503746938b25584d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,240,233,217,60,233,167,136,138,16,192,229,3,116,105,56,178,85,132,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
