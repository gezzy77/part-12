This one is compiled with hard float support, so basically floating point operations are MUCH faster because they are done in hardware instead of software emulation :)\n\nFeatures include:\n\n    A minimal Raspbian Wheezy installation (similar to a netinstall)\n    Hard Float binaries: floating point operations are done in hardware instead of software emulation, that means higher performances\n    Disabled incremental updates, means apt-get update is much faster\n    Workaround for a kernel bug which hangs the Raspberry Pi under heavy network/disk loads\n    3.6.11+ hardfp kernel with latest raspberry pi patches\n    Latest version of the firmwares\n    Fits 1GB SD cards\n    A very tiny 118MB image: even with a 2GB SD there is a lot of free space\n    ssh starts by default\n    The clock is automatically updated using\n    IPv6 support\n    Just 14MB of ram usage after the boot\n\n\n\nYou will have to extract the image with p7zip:\n\n7za x raspbian_wheezy_20130923.img.7z\n\n\n\nThen flash it to your SD with dd:\n\ndd bs=1M if=raspbian_wheezy_20130923.img of=/dev/sdX\n\n\n\nFinally, if you have an sd larger than 1GB, grow the partition with gparted (first move the swap partition at the end).\n\nThe root password is raspberry.\n\n\n\nYou will have to reconfigure your timezone after the first boot:\n\ndpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\n\n\nThe keyboard layout:\n\ndpkg-reconfigure console-data\n\n\n\nAnd the localization:\n\ndpkg-reconfigure locales\n\n\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done, I hope you will enjoy it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230ff534180ee71db902a13abe98acb1ef9dbc54","amp;dn":"Raspbian+Wheezy+armhf+Raspberry+Pi+minimal+image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230ff534180ee71db902a13abe98acb1ef9dbc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,15,245,52,24,14,231,29,185,2,161,58,190,152,172,177,239,157,188,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
