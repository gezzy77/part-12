Thanks to the uploader. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6942588/Hitch_Hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy__The_%5B1981_PAL_DVD%5D%5BEn_Subs%5BNor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6942588/Hitch_Hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy__The_%5B1981_PAL_DVD%5D%5BEn_Subs%5BNor&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe DVD quality is fairly average so I tried to clean the video up a bit while re-encoding.\n\nFor reasons I don't quite understand, the DVD audio didn't include all the narration (voice of the book). It was missing in six places. I fixed it by cutting the narration out of the audio from the AVI versions and adding it to the DVD audio.\n\nFor some reason the audio of the AVIs is also a little odd. For instance the narration mostly only appears in one channel. So where I took the narration from the AVIs, I duplicated the channel to put the narration in both left and right.\n\nOnce again, thanks to the uploader (I downloaded the AVIs quite a while ago but I think they came from the following torrent). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4319064/Hitch_Hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy__The_%281981%29_-_MiniSeries_-_DVDR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4319064/Hitch_Hikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy__The_%281981%29_-_MiniSeries_-_DVDR&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUnlike the AVIs, where the series is divided into 6 episodes, the DVD version is divided into two parts. I used chapters in the MKVs to make it easy to navigate to the beginning of a particular episode (3 episodes per MKV).\n\nVideo: x264, 640x480, 25fps, CRF18\nAudio: AAC, Stereo, q.50\n\nSubtitles (VobSub format): Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d76b24c016256a2e758e5f9dfb37f3f8bda2091","amp;dn":"Hitch+Hikers+Guide+To+The+Galaxy%2C+The+%281981+BBC+Series%29+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d76b24c016256a2e758e5f9dfb37f3f8bda2091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,118,178,76,1,98,86,162,231,88,229,249,223,179,127,63,139,218,32,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
