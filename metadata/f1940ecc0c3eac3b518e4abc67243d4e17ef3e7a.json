Rinehart and Winston | 1973 | ISBN 0030828651 | English | 380 pages | PDF | 62.9 MB\n\nArt, Music &amp; Ideas is a history of the principal styles of Western art as mirrored in selected masterpieces of architecture, sculpture, painting, literature, and music. The book's purpose is not to provide a comprehensive history of the arts but to point out and explore the mainstream in Western styles as they crystallized in major centers of civilization at moments of high cultural achievement. Thus, specific works of art are placed in the foreground, but they are also examined in their relationships to one another and against the background of ideas that animated the life of their times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1940ecc0c3eac3b518e4abc67243d4e17ef3e7a","amp;dn":"Art%2C+Music+and+Ideas+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1940ecc0c3eac3b518e4abc67243d4e17ef3e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,148,14,204,12,62,172,59,81,142,74,188,103,36,61,78,23,239,62,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
