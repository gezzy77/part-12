The original files were around 350 megabytes, i reencoded them to a more manageable 175 megabytes. Some of these files from the original torrent had a large watermark on the bottom right corner. For those episodes i used other sources.\n\nAll the marked as DVD Rips have the following specs:\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128 kbps or MP3 @ 128 Kbps (Depending on the source file) \t\n\nSome of the source files which i listed below were DVD rips but weren't made by me. They used lower resolution (less than 640x480) and were encoded in xvid (rather than h264).\n\nI also included Shada, this is an unfinished serial intended to be the final of Season 17, but was never completed due to a work strike at the BBC during filming. In 1992, its recorded footage was released on video using linking narration by Tom Baker to complete the story.\n\nThere is another version of Shada created by Big Finish Productions, it was created as an audio play, with flash animation and was made available on BBCi and the BBC website in 2003. This version saw Paul McGann take on the role of the 8th Doctor, with Lalla Ward reprising her role as Romana II, with an otherwise different cast. Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked to make the story fit into Doctor Who continuity. (I didn't include this version in this torrent). \n\n1201 - Robot - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1202 - The Ark in Space - DVD Rip\n1203 - The Sontaran Experiment - DVD Rip\n1204 - Genesis of the Daleks - DVD Rip\n1205 - Revenge of the Cybermen - DVD Rip\n\n1301 - Terror of the Zygons - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1302 - Planet of Evil - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1303 - Pyramid of Mars - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1304 - The Android Invasion - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1305 - The Brain of Morbius - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1306 - The Seeds of Doom - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n\n1401 - The Masque of Mandragora - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1402 - The Hand of Fear - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1403 - The Deadly Assassin - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1404 - The Face of Evil - DVD Rip\n1405 - The Robots of Death - DVD Rip\n1406 - The Talons of Weng-Chiang - DVD Rip\n\n1501 - Horror of Fang Rock - DVD Rip\n1502 - The Invisible Enemy - DVD Rip\n1503 - Image of the Fendahl - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n1504 - The Sun Makers - Xvid DVD rip 576x432\n1505 - Underworld - Xvid DVD rip 512x384\n1506 - The Invasion of Time - Australian Digital TV broadcast\n\n1601 - The Ribos Operation - DVD Rip\n1602 - The Pirate Planet - DVD Rip\n1603 - The Stones of Blood - DVD Rip\n1604 - The Androids of Tara - DVD Rip 576x432\n1605 - The Power of Kroll - DVD Rip\n1606 - The Armageddon Factor - DVD Rip\n\n1701 - Destiny of the Daleks - DVD Rip\n1702 - City of Death - VHS rip\n1703 - The Creature From the Pit - Parts 1 and 2 are VHS rip, Parts 3 and 4 are xvid DVD rip 512x384\n1704 - Nightmare of Eden - DVD Rip\n1705 - Horns of Nimon - VHS Rip\n1706 - Unfinished Serial - Shada - VHS Rip\n\n1801 - The Leisure Hive - XVID DVD Rip 512x384\n1802 - Meglos - DVD Rip\n1803 - Full Circle - VHS Rip\n1804 - State of Decay - DVD Rip\n1805 - Warriors' Gate - DVD Rip\n1806 - The Keeper of Traken - DVD Rip\n1807 - Logopolis - VHS Rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1859f7c7a8256e5dd5e773dc32772f500a2d65a6","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+1974+-+1981+%284th+Doctor+-+Tom+Baker%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1859f7c7a8256e5dd5e773dc32772f500a2d65a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,89,247,199,168,37,110,93,213,231,115,220,50,119,47,80,10,45,101,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
