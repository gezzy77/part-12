And that statistic only tells us about first trimester miscarriages. The emotional pain of longer-term miscarriages, and the untold numbers of mothers and fathers who keep silent about their hurt, make this form of child loss especially cruel.\n\nBut in Silent Grief, author Clara Hinton brings a clear message of hope through the cold mourning. Writing of her own grief, and interviewing scores of women and men, she offers not pat answers, but instead show us this: You are not alone.\n\nAdditionally, the author touches the tears of other forms of child loss: stillbirth, missing children, and adult children who succumb to accident or illness.\n\nThe moving, honest responses to these interviews tells the reader that through the tears and rage and awful silence, God still loves us and knows our children intimately. King David knew this. He knew that one day he would reunited with his child.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nClara Hinton is a motivational speaker, author of many books. She has experienced first-hand the grief associated with sibling loss, child loss, and grandchild loss.
