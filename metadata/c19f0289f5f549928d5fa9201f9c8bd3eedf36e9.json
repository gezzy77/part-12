This course is designed for residents of both: construction personnel, architects, and engineers who are looking to integrate design with the as-built world. Learn how to use Navisworks Manage and Navisworks Simulate to gain control and get a holistic view of your projects. Eric Wing shows how to manage models, clash the models for interference, and virtually construct a building using a construction timeline. He also shows how to create material takeoffs and conduct live, interactive walk-throughs with clients and contractors. On the surface, Navisworks might look like just a file viewer, but with this course, you'll learn things about its analysis and simulation tools that would be either impossible or impossibly expensive any other way.\nTopics include:\nAppending and merging different file types\nWalking through your model\nWorking with viewpoints\nReviewing and marking up a model\nManipulating and finding objects\nAdding links to objects\nSorting and grouping\nCreating clash tests\nAdding a timeline with the Timeliner\nCreating material takeoffs\nCreating custom animations and scripts for an interactive movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19f0289f5f549928d5fa9201f9c8bd3eedf36e9","amp;dn":"Navisworks+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19f0289f5f549928d5fa9201f9c8bd3eedf36e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,159,2,137,245,245,73,146,141,95,169,32,31,156,139,211,238,223,54,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
