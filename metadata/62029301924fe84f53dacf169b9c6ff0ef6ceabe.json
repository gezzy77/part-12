And from Hobbes and Burke through Lord Salisbury and Calvin Coolidge, up to Pat Buchanan and Mark Steyn in our own time, these beliefs have kept the human race from blindly chasing its utopian dreams right off a cliff.\n\nRecently, though, various comforting yet fundamentally idiotic notions of political correctness and wishful thinking have taken root beyond the &quot;Kumbaya&quot;-singing, we're-all-one crowd. These ideas have now infected conservatives, the very people who really should know better. The Republican Party has been derailed by legions of fools and poseurs wearing smiley-face masks.\n\nThink rescuing the economy by condemning our descendents to lives of spirit-crushing debt. Think nation-building abroad while we slowly disintegrate at home. Think education and No Child Left Behind. . . . But don't think about it too much, because if you do, you'll quickly come to the logical conclusion: We are doomed.\n\nNeed more convincing? Dwell on the cheerful promises of the diversity cult and the undeniable reality of the oncoming demographic disaster. Contemplate the feminization of everything, or take a good look at what passes for art these days. Witness the rise of culturism and the death of religion. Bow down before your new master, the federal apparatchik. Finally, ask yourself: How certain am I that the United States of America will survive, in any recognizable form, until, say, 2022?\n\nA scathing, mordantly funny romp through today's dismal and dismaler political and cultural scene, We Are Doomed provides a long-overdue dose of reality, revealing just how the GOP has been led astray in recent yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€œand showing that had conservatives held on to their fittingly pessimistic outlook, America's future would be far brighter.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it's time to embrace the Audacity of Hopelessness.\n\n272 pages\nPublisher: Three Rivers Press (October 5, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0307409597\nISBN-13: 978-0307409591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62029301924fe84f53dacf169b9c6ff0ef6ceabe","amp;dn":"We+Are+Doomed+%282010%29+by+John+Derbyshire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62029301924fe84f53dacf169b9c6ff0ef6ceabe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,2,147,1,146,79,232,79,83,218,207,22,155,156,111,240,239,108,234,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
