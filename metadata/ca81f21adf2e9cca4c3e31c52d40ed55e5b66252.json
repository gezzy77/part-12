It was released in October 1976, after the group had broken up.\n\nMade in Europe features songs recorded in concert 4 April in Graz, Austria, 5 April in SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken, Germany, and 7 April 1975 in Paris, France with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. According to the liner notes included on Mk III: The Final Concerts, though, the material featured on Made in Europe came, for the most part, from the SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken show. Additionally, this performance is said to have experienced extensive studio editing and/or overdubbing of crowd noise and applause. Certainly there is a tape-loop of applause, given away by a whistling fan.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Burn&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Jon Lord, Ian Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:32\n    &quot;Mistreated&quot; (interpolating &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:32\n    &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;You Fool No One&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Hughes, Lord, Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 16:42\n    &quot;Stormbringer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:38\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDeep Purple\n\n    Ritchie Blackmore - Lead guitar\n    David Coverdale - lead vocals\n    Glenn Hughes - bass and vocals\n    Jon Lord - Hammond organ and keyboards\n    Ian Paice - drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca81f21adf2e9cca4c3e31c52d40ed55e5b66252","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+In+Europe+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca81f21adf2e9cca4c3e31c52d40ed55e5b66252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,129,242,26,223,46,156,202,76,62,49,197,45,64,237,85,229,182,98,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
