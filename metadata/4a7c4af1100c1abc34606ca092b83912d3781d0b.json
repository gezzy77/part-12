Now, in what has become a rite of spring, the band pulls \n\ninto town every March for an extended string of shows. To the fans who flock into \n\nManhattan each year from all over the country, these shows are known simply as\n\n&quot;The Beacon Run&quot;.\n\nAfter an Allman Brothers Band show at the Beacon, you come away redeemed, happy \n\ndown to the bone. You walk out into the cool night, and a little piece of that time\n\nless magic sticks with you. At its core, this is a blues band, and the redemptive\n\npowerof the blues is in the way they can transform universal pain into white light\n\nand pure joy. And no one does this as well as the Brothers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a7c4af1100c1abc34606ca092b83912d3781d0b","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers+-+Live+At+The+Beacon+Theatre+NY+%28AVI+VIDEO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a7c4af1100c1abc34606ca092b83912d3781d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,124,74,241,16,12,26,188,52,96,108,160,146,184,57,18,211,120,29,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
