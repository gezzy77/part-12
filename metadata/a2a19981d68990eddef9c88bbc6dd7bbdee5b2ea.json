And he has plans for Sunnyvale. But unfortunately for Lahey, Julian stands in his way. With his big plans for Sunnyvale going down the toilet, his relationship with Randy broken down, and having the Boys back in the park is all way too much pressure for him to bear. For Jim Lahey, the countdown to liquor day begins.\n\n\n Ricky, Julian e Bubbles saiem da cadeia com a ideia de abrir um negÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³cio legÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­timo.
