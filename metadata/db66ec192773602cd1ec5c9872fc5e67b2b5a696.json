Yet in all the ongoing debates about creationism and its descendant, &quot;intelligent design,&quot; one element of the controversy is rarely mentioned: the evidence, the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. And that evidence is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from a huge spectrum of scientific inquiry ranging from genetics, anatomy, and molecular biology to paleontology and geology.\n\nWhy Evolution Is True is a succinct and accessible summary of the facts supporting Darwinian evolution. Scientists today are finding species splitting in two, observing natural selection changing animals and plants before our eyes, and discovering more and more fossils capturing change in the pastÃ¢â‚¬â€dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs. Jerry Coyne eloquently shows that evolution does not destroy the beauty of life but enhances it.\n\n Reading this book will explain why so many scientists have dedicated their careers to resolving this debate, and why education administrators fervently fight legislation demanding that science curricula include equal time for anti-Darwinian theories. By demonstrating the &quot;indelible stamp&quot; of the processes first proposed by Darwin, Jerry Coyne clearly confirms that evolution is more than just a theory: it is a factÃ¢â‚¬â€a fact that cannot be doubted by anyone with an open mind.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db66ec192773602cd1ec5c9872fc5e67b2b5a696","amp;dn":"Jerry+A.+Coyne+-+Why+Evolution+Is+True","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db66ec192773602cd1ec5c9872fc5e67b2b5a696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,102,236,25,39,115,96,44,209,236,92,152,114,252,94,103,178,181,166,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
