Kalat\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY is the best selling text in the market for good reasons--an extremely high level of scholarship, clear and occasionally humorous writing style, and precise examples. An extremely skilled teacher, Dr. Kalat has written a text that speaks to today\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s students as well as to professors. Throughout all ten editions, the goal has been to make biological psychology accessible to psychology students, not just to biology majors and pre-meds. The goal has also been to convey the excitement of the search for biological explanations of behavior. Kalat believes that biological psychology is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;the most interesting topic in the world,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and this text convinces many students. Accuracy, currency and a clear presentation style have always been the hallmarks of this text, and this Tenth Edition and its supplement package take these qualities to the next level. Sold separately and available for the first time, a media-rich, highly interactive online eBook integrates the text; a companion CD-ROM, Exploring Biological Psychology; Try It Yourself activities; Stop &amp; Check quizzes; and new animations.\n\n# Hardcover: 576 pages\n# Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 10 edition (December 16, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495603007\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495603009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9be2ce992d5ea51362cf7c92cabc6aa8ebb121","amp;dn":"Biological+Psychology%2C10+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a9be2ce992d5ea51362cf7c92cabc6aa8ebb121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,155,226,206,153,45,94,165,19,98,207,124,146,202,188,106,168,235,177,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
