In time he has a family and many friends, but he also finds friction with a few of his parishioners. A young doctor grates at what he feels is the parson's interference in the scientific treatment of patients, and a mine owner resents Grey's protection of an old sharecropper whose small plot of land stands in the way of his continued mining. Grey must face a public health crisis and a lynch mob as a result, all seen and described through the eyes and memory of Grey's young nephew John.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcb5b5ba7f980bbfa5d8cb8634c6cc1509bfbb1","amp;dn":"Stars+in+my+Crown+-+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcb5b5ba7f980bbfa5d8cb8634c6cc1509bfbb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,203,91,91,167,249,128,187,250,93,140,184,99,76,108,193,80,155,251,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
