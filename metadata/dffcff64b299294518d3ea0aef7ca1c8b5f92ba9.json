Each volume features one or two sides of instrumental music from a different Soviet Socialist Republic. The recordings feature performances by both amateurs and professionals, mostly instrumental but with some vocal tracks. \n\nThe recordings are in most cases of the highest quality: rich, detailed, clean, with nice tonal balance. The LP pressings are quite good, with minimal pressing noise and essentially no tracking distortion. Each LP includes a booklet with brief descriptions of each track, descriptions of the instruments, and pictures of some of the instruments. \n\nVolume 8 has instrumental music from Azerbaidjan on side A and instrumental music from Turkmenistan on side B. With the exception of a few tracks for flutes and duduks, this is music for plucked and bowed string instruments. There is some virtuoso improvisation here, and the harmonic progressions in the Turkmen music are particularly intriguing. \n\nMy LP copy is in excellent condition. It was transcribed to tagged 24-bit, 44.1 kHz FLAC files, using an analog rig that is near state-of-the-art. I used the mildest possible de-clicking but otherwise no noise reduction. The torrent includes a PDF file with scans of the notes in English and pictures of instruments in the booklet. \n\nI own 7 of 10 volumes of this set. I've already transcribed one other, and will be transcribing at least two more in the coming weeks. \n\nEquipment used for A/D conversion: Linn Akiva phono cartridge, Linn LP12/Lingo turntable, Linn Ekos SE tonearm, Audioquest LeoPard tonearm cable, PS Audio PS2 preamplifier, Kimber PBJ interconnect, M-Audio Audiophile USB A/D converter.\n\nAzerbaidjan Instrumental Music\n\n01 - Goioun Khengui [1:36]\n02 - Lai-Lai [2:49]\n03 - Makhour [2:42]\n04 - Seguiakh [4:14]\n05 - Rast [2:18]\n06 - Ker-ogli Encounters His Son [2:46]\n07 - Baiati-Chiraz [3:08]\n08 - Achoug Alesker [3:39]\n\nTurkmen Instrumental Music\n\n01 - Aidjemal [2:41]\n02 - Aman-Aman [2:56]\n03 - Ak Echekli [2:32]\n04 - I Beg You My Sweet [3:49]\n05 - Maral Gueledir [2:23]\n06 - Guelin Gueledir [2:02]\n07 - Chassenema and Garib [3:45]\n08 - Ilkham [2:31]\n\nNOTE: To the best of my knowledge, these recordings are not currently available commercially.
