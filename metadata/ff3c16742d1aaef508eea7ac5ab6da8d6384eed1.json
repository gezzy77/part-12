Doris Day, John Raitt, Carol Haney\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050814/\r\n\r\n\r\nBoxoffice Magazine Awards - WON - Best Picture of the Month for the Whole Family\r\n\r\nThe Pajama Game should be required viewing - at least once a year! It is a meticulous rendering of the Broadway smash hit of the mid-1950s and assembles most of the original Broadway cast, adding Doris Day in a sizzling performance. The result is just about as good as it can get. Doris Day returned to musicals after a brief hiatus during which she starred in Hitchcock's classic, The Man Who Knew Too Much and MGM's thriller Julie. It was a return to the Warners lot, after a three-year absence, to create one of her finest musical portrayals. As Babe Williams, head of the Grievance Committee at a pajama factory, she is tough and determined but also very, very feminine and very sexy. When she meets Sid Sorokin, she falls head over heels in love, and it's easy to understand why.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x400, 23.976 fps, 1646 Kbps, 01h41m02s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 256 kbps\r\nRatio: 16:9\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional subtitles English, Portuguese-Brazil, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yxj9pklqj/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/sxu6nbymj/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/l3tl1xqtn/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/n7409lqmj/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ivfekljpn/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3c16742d1aaef508eea7ac5ab6da8d6384eed1","amp;dn":"The+Pajama+Game+%5B1957+-+USA%5D+%28Doris+Day%29+musical+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3c16742d1aaef508eea7ac5ab6da8d6384eed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,60,22,116,45,26,174,245,8,238,167,172,90,182,218,141,99,132,238,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
