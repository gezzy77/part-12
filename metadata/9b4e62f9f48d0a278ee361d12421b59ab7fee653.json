Its main concession to Hollywood formula was the casting of star players who were all too old to convincingly portray Hemingway&amp;#039;s &quot;Lost Generation&quot; protagonists. Tyrone Power heads the cast as American news correspondent Jake Barnes, who, after incurring a injury in WW I that has rendered him impotent, relocates to Paris to escape his troubles. Barnes links up with several other lost souls, including the nymphomaniacal Lady Brett Ashley (Ava Gardner), irresponsible drunkard Mike Campbell (Errol Flynn) and perennial hangers-on Robert Cohn (Mel Ferrer) and Bill Gorton (Eddie Albert). In their never-ending search for new thrills, Barnes and his cohorts trundle off to Spain, where they participate in the annual Pamplona bull run and act as unofficial &quot;sponsors&quot; of handsome young matador Pedro Romero (played by future film executive Robert Evans). Additionally, Lady Brett pursues a romance with Jake, despite her engagement to the dissolute Campbell. Filmed on location in Pamplona, Paris, Biarritz and Mexico, The Sun Also Rises was budgeted at $5 million; like many &quot;big&quot; pictures of the era, it tended to be hollow and draggy at times. The film&amp;#039;s best performance is delivered by Errol Flynn, though it can be argued that, in taking on the role of the hedonistic, hard-drinking, burned-out Mike Campbell, he was merely playing himself. A vastly inferior version of The Sun Also Rises was produced for television in 1984.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051028/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051028/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allsubs.org/search-subtitle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allsubs.org/search-subtitle&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nHenry King\n\n        Tyrone Power\t ... \tJacob &quot;Jake&quot; Barnes\n\n\tAva Gardner\t... \tLady Brett Ashley\n\tMel Ferrer\t... \tRobert Cohn\n\n\tErrol Flynn\t... \tMike Campbell\n\tEddie Albert\t... \tBill Gorton\n\nThe Sun Also RIses (1957) Tyrone Powers,Ava Gardner-Dual(Eng-Span).avi\nFile Size : 1,21 Gb.\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:04:51\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 612x250\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1129 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,30 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4e62f9f48d0a278ee361d12421b59ab7fee653","amp;dn":"The+sun+also+rises+%281957%29+Tyrone+Powers%2CAva+Gardner-Dual+%28Eng-Sp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4e62f9f48d0a278ee361d12421b59ab7fee653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,78,98,249,244,141,10,39,142,227,97,209,36,33,181,154,183,254,230,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
