She had long red hair, a pretty face, and a propensity for utterly failing at witchery. Her name was Laluna.&quot; This tongue-in-cheek original fairy tale follows the adventures of Laluna, a young witch who inherits her grandmother's potion shop. It's Halloween, the most bewitching night of the year, but even the most well intentioned spells have a habit of going badly for Laluna. When a charm for true love unearths a zombie, she must make amends with the help of her vampire best (almost more than) friend and cupcakes no ghoul can resist. &quot;Hallow's Eve&quot; is a short, lively, light-hearted romp across a most unusual Halloween night--the story is for all ages. Also includes bonus Halloween fairy tale: &quot;Once Upon a Hallow's Eve!&quot; &quot;Stories often begin with 'Once upon a time,' or 'Once there was--' charming lines that imply a fairy tale. Our story starts with wolves in the woods, and--by degrees--gets worse. &quot;This tale, as you can imagine, is not the charming sort.&quot; A young girl, with a hopeless wish, a Dark King with a candle for a heart, a single Hallow's Eve night to spin the brightest of magics. &quot;Once Upon a Hallow's Eve,&quot; a short story and original Halloween fairy tale, travels to the court of Dark Shadows and back again on a bewitching journey across a most unusual Halloween night.\n\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (9 May 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1461171369\nISBN-13: 978-1461171362","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:755f16ab09ee9def6e5dd0d8e27502796f97748a","amp;dn":"Hallow%27s+Eve+A+Halloween+Fairy+Tale%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"755f16ab09ee9def6e5dd0d8e27502796f97748a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,95,22,171,9,238,157,239,110,93,208,216,226,117,2,121,111,151,116,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
