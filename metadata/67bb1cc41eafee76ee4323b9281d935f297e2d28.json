The film starts with Lola Sepa who is traveling through the mean streets of Manlia with her grandson. They are on their way to make an appointment. When the picture starts, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not quite sure what these two are up to. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not until they meet up with Lola SepaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter at a funeral home. They are shopping for coffins. This opening scene is done in a very interesting way. The point of the scene is the purchasing of coffins but before then are smaller scenes of prayers at a church, a memorial, and a mugging on the streets. When we get to the funeral home we think Lola Sepa is buying a coffin for herself but then we find out sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s buying a coffin for her grandson, who was murdered days before.\n\nLola Carpin is the grandmother of the suspected killer, Mateo. We first meet Lola Carpin visiting her grandson in prison. We are brought to this rather scary and rough Filipino prison filled with equally scary and rough prisoners. On first meeting with her grandson, Lola Carpin is more concerned with general well being of Mateo. She asks him whether or not he has eaten dinner today. This is an organic response of a grandmother visiting her grandson. In this way, her view of Mateo is genuine. Her feelings towards his alleged crime is non-existent rather she ignores the suspicions and the backdrop of the scene.\n\nMendoza plays this film in an interesting way, dealing with grief and loss through the strength of two elderly matriarchs. One deals with it buy accepting and moving on, the other ignores and manufactures her perfect family. Both are caretakers of their respective families so who are we to judge whether one way is better than the other. Mendoza puts these ideas in the context of the grief. His camera is objective, shot as a documentary, Mendoza follows the action rather than creates it.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Lola.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.47 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 915 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate : 1 681 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.239\n      Stream size : 1.29 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 49mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 224 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 176 MiB (12%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1496792/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1496792/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTagalog audio; Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by duder, whom we thank\n\nBrillante Mendoza - Lola (2009)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bb1cc41eafee76ee4323b9281d935f297e2d28","amp;dn":"Brillante+Mendoza+-+Lola+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bb1cc41eafee76ee4323b9281d935f297e2d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,187,28,196,30,175,238,118,238,67,35,185,40,29,147,95,41,126,45,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
