Mostly just some small quality things and minor updates/additions/fixes/etc.\n\nThe missing Usagi song and a demo are added, and their EP is now at 320.\n\nBoth of the comp songs are included now (Shinya Kousoku is really good).\n\nI can't remember all the other stuff I did, but that's about it. Pretty sure it's mostly scans and such anyway.\n\nBut wow, I really had a lot of fun doing this despite it being a pain in the ass sometimes. If anything else pops up (Usagi's old demos, the '05-'06 DVD, any new Mariko stuff, etc.) I'll upload that separately. For now, though, this is as complete as it'll get.\n\nEnjoy, and PLEASE SEED!\n\nÃ£â€šÂ·Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’â€°Ã£ï¿½ï¿½Ã£ï¿½Â Ã£ï¿½â€¢Ã£ï¿½â€ž!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76090c228b1f97df3ba8b596971e59321cdf0690","amp;dn":"Midori+%28%E3%83%9F%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA%29+Discography+%28FINAL%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76090c228b1f97df3ba8b596971e59321cdf0690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,9,12,34,139,31,151,223,59,168,181,150,151,30,89,50,28,223,6,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
