As hip-hop culture spread from America, graffiti became a worldwide phenomenon, emerging in the 1980s as the symbolic artistic language of young people everywhere and one of the most potent influences on youth-oriented marketing and design. With more than 2,000 illustrations by over 150 artists from all over the world and interviews with many of them, this visually arresting book is the most comprehensive survey of graffiti art ever published.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7096fc77f460c1d4f84a5cb67299288db658e0f","amp;dn":"Graffiti+World+Street+Art+From+Five+Continents.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7096fc77f460c1d4f84a5cb67299288db658e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,9,111,199,127,70,12,29,79,132,165,203,103,41,146,136,219,101,142,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
