However for this project he just wanted to get back to the solid foundation of Chicago-styled traditional guitar blues, done with his rare blend of reverence, involvement and individuality and framed largely by his working band. Blues In My Soul features three Lurrie Bell originals plus covers of songs recorded by Little Walter, T-Bone Walker, Jimmy Rogers, Otis Spann, Junior Wells, Big Bill Broonzy and others. Lurrie Bell, vocals, guitar: Roosevelt Purifoy, piano, organ; Melvin Smith, bass, Willie &quot;The Touch&quot; Hayes, drums; and on six songs Matthew Skoller, harmonica. Produced by Dick Shurman.
