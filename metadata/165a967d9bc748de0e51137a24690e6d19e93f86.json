It aims to teach kids about sound, light, and electricity through some kind of rock concert show thing. I certainly enjoyed it, and wanted to share.\n\nThe game works fine under Windows XP- I haven't tested it under Vista or later.\n\n1. Mount the ISO in Daemon Tools/Alcohol 120%/MagicDisk or burn it to a CD using ImgBurn\n\n2. Open/Explore the disk and right click on SETUP.EXE.
