In the world of phone phreaks, hackers, and scammers, he's a legend. His exploits are hotly debated: could he really get free long-distance calls by whistling into a pay phone? Did his video-game piracy scheme accidentally trigger the first computer virus? And did he really dodge the FBI by using their own wiretapping software against them? Is he even a real person? And if he's ever caught, what would happen to a geek like him in federal prison? Inspired by the incredible stories of real-life hackers, Wizzygig is the thrilling tale of a master manipulator - his journey from precocious child scammer to federally-wanted fugitive, and beyond. In a world transformed by social networks and data leaks, Ed Piskor's debut graphic novel reminds us how much power can rest in the hands of an audacious kid with a keyboard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb3ce1cddfa27a0f10ec189d6c4dbd54ee87c686","amp;dn":"Ed+Piskor+-+Wizzywig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb3ce1cddfa27a0f10ec189d6c4dbd54ee87c686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,60,225,205,223,162,122,15,16,236,24,157,108,77,189,84,238,135,198,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
