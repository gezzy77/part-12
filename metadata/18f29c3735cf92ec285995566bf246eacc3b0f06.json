Almost fifty years after Martin Luther King, Jr.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, equality is the law of the land, but actual integration is still hard to find. Mammoth battles over forced busing, unfair housing practices, and affirmative action have hardly helped. The bleak fact is that black people and white people in the United States donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spend much time togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€at work, school, church, or anywhere. Tanner Colby, himself a child of a white-flight Southern suburb, set out to discover why.\nSome of My Best Friends Are Black chronicles AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubling relationship with race through four interrelated stories: the transformation of a once-racist Birmingham school system; a Kansas City neighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fight against housing discrimination; the curious racial divide of the Madison Avenue ad world; and a Louisiana Catholic parishÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forty-year effort to build an integrated church. Writing with a reporterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nose and a stylistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flair, Colby uncovers the deep emotional fault lines set trembling by race and takes an unflinching look at an America still struggling to reach the mountaintop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f29c3735cf92ec285995566bf246eacc3b0f06","amp;dn":"Some+of+My+Best+Friends+Are+Black-+The+Strange+Story+of+Integrat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f29c3735cf92ec285995566bf246eacc3b0f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,242,156,55,53,207,146,236,40,89,149,86,107,242,70,234,204,59,15,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
