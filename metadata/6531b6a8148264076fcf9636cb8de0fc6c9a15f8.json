Based on Quranic teachings, the Speaker argues that:\n\n* Swords can win territories but not hearts, force can bend heads but not minds;\n* The role of women is not of concubines in harems nor a society imprisoned in the four walls of their homes;\n* Richer nations provide aid with strings attached and yet the flow of wealth continues to be in the direction of the rich while the poorer sink deeper in the red;\n* Religion does not need to be the predominant legislative authority in the political affairs of a state;\n* Irrespective of the thawing of the Cold War, the issue of war and peace does not only hang by the thread of superpower relationship;\n* Without God there can be no peace.\n\nIt also contains comprehensive discussion on interest; financial aid; international relations; and the role of Israel, America and the United Kingdom in a new world order.\n\nIts message is timeless and relates to the future prospects for peace. It is a compulsory read for non-Muslims as well as for those Muslims who have forgotten the true message of Islam.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6531b6a8148264076fcf9636cb8de0fc6c9a15f8","amp;dn":"Islams+Response+To+Contemporary+Issues+%5Bpdf%5D+%5Bmobi%5D+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6531b6a8148264076fcf9636cb8de0fc6c9a15f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,49,182,168,20,130,100,7,111,207,150,54,203,141,224,252,108,154,21,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
