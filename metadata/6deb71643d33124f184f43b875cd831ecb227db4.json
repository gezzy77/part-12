Suddenly, miracles happen in the little town: the son of the newcomer and veterinary Morgan Elliot survives a car accident without a single scratch; Travis&amp;#039;s dog Max revives after being buried; a paraplegic walks; a wounded woman and her father with brain tumor heal. In all the events, three men wearing black were seen, and then the unknown Brandon Nichols claims to be Jesus Christ. The local population worships Brandon, while Travis and Morgan feel that something is wrong and conduct an investigation, disclosing that evil has possessed the dwellers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6deb71643d33124f184f43b875cd831ecb227db4","amp;dn":"The.Visitation.2006.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6deb71643d33124f184f43b875cd831ecb227db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,235,113,100,61,51,18,79,24,79,67,184,117,205,131,30,203,34,125,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
