While issues like web design are briefly touched upon, the emphasis is on the integration of this new channel with the established brick-click model. The book surveys the spread of internet facilities and the use of mobile phones with internet connectivity; it takes a look at the economic basis for important decisions like pricing, price discrimination, and marketing services as well as changes in routine administration, particularly back office functioning. The book also examines the working of e-banking, e-insurance, and e-broking.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39e95dea2c5f25f29fb1a1c8a915e2b6192823d3","amp;dn":"E-Finance%3A+The+Future+is+Here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39e95dea2c5f25f29fb1a1c8a915e2b6192823d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,233,93,234,44,95,37,242,159,177,161,200,169,21,226,182,25,40,35,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
