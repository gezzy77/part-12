Does his famous painting, &quot;The Last Supper,&quot; contain a hidden code about this societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most precious secret? Did Jesus father children by Mary Magdalene? What was the Holy Grail?\n\nThe best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown has stirred the popular imagination by cleverly interweaving theories about such questions with a fast-paced fictional narrative. Many readers have been so swept away by the drama of this murder mystery that they have accepted BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fictional reconstruction of Christian origins and medieval history as established fact.\n\nNew Testament scholar Robert M. Price, a member of the prestigious Jesus Seminar, examines the creative uses of history in BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel, showing that, however intriguing BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fictional speculations may be, the real facts behind the novel are even more fascinating.\n\nWhat does the best historical evidence say about the possibility that Jesus might have survived the crucifixion? How did the Gospels come to be accepted as the established accounts of JesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ life and why were other Gnostic traditions suppressed? How did the Roman Emperor Constantine figure in the development of Christian dogma? What was Mary MagdaleneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in early Christianity and how was it adapted in later attempts to develop a &quot;sacred feminine&quot; element in Christianity? These are some of the important questions about Christianity that Dr. Price pursues in this engrossing discussion of Christian history.\n\nPrice combines sophisticated historical analysis with completely accessible and witty prose in this enlightening, factually based analysis of BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speculative bestseller.\nGenre: Non-fiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70c7796637fcc16f5026c8dac4207f3df900cb74","amp;dn":"The+Da+Vinci+Fraud+Why+the+Truth+Is+Stranger+Than+Fiction+by+Rob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70c7796637fcc16f5026c8dac4207f3df900cb74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,199,121,102,55,252,193,111,80,38,200,218,196,32,127,61,249,0,203,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
