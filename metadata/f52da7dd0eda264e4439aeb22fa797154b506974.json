The event broadcast by TV Globo and in the first year by TV Rio - and competed with Festival of MPB's Record - left a huge legacy. The most obvious are the MPB classics as &quot;Saveiros&quot;, &quot;Carolina&quot;, &quot;SabiÃƒÂ¡&quot;, &quot;AndanÃƒÂ§a&quot;, &quot;Pra NÃƒÂ£o Dizer Que NÃƒÂ£o Falei das Flores&quot;, &quot;BR-3&quot;, &quot;Fio Maravilha&quot;, &quot;Casa No Campo &quot;. There are also revelatory moments of aesthetic and political tensions of the time, as the boos Nana Caymmi (&quot;Saveiros&quot;), Tom Jobim and Chico Buarque (&quot;SabiÃƒÂ¡&quot;), Jards MacalÃƒÂ© (&quot;Gotham City&quot;) and Caetano Veloso (&quot;Ãƒâ€° Proibido Proibir&quot;).\nThe first three CDs were recorded live for a TV show in the 60s, in an auditorium whose capacity was more than 30 thousand people. The others were recorded in the studio and the quality will improve substantially. The first three are worth more as a historical record than the pleasure by hearing them.\n\nCD 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (1966)\n\n\nCD 2 - I Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (1966)\n\n\nCD 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ II Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (1967)\n\n\nCD 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ III Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (Ritmos-Codil 1968)\n\n\nCD 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ III Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (Odeon 1968)\n\n\nCD 6 - III Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (Odeon 1968)\n\n\nCD 7 - III Festival Internacional da CanÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Popular (Odeon 1968)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52da7dd0eda264e4439aeb22fa797154b506974","amp;dn":"Festivais+da+Cancao+Vol.+1+%281966%2F68%29+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52da7dd0eda264e4439aeb22fa797154b506974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,45,167,221,14,218,38,78,68,57,174,178,47,167,151,21,75,80,105,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
