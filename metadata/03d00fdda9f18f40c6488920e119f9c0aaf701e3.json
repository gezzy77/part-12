Featuring 20 innovative and fun projectsÃ¯Â¿Â½such as the Lotus Blossom Vest, the Go for Baroque Tote, the Counting Crows Pullover, and the Wedding Belle CardiganÃ¯Â¿Â½this guide accompanies each with detailed instructional outlines in the tutorial section and is perfect for a variety of skill levels. Going beyond the usual snowflake and reindeer motifs of traditional Norwegian patterns, this modern resource addresses a niche few other knitting guides have explored and offers a technique section that is enjoyable thanks to its conversational tone. Advanced techniques are also highlighted, such as managing two balls of yarn, adding steeks, and finishing cut edges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d00fdda9f18f40c6488920e119f9c0aaf701e3","amp;dn":"The+New+Stranded+Colorwork%3A+Techniques+and+Patterns+for+Vibrant+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d00fdda9f18f40c6488920e119f9c0aaf701e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,208,15,221,169,241,143,64,198,72,137,32,225,25,249,192,170,247,1,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
