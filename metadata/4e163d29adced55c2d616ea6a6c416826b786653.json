Morgan is one of the survivors who grew up in that era and has been plagued by drug abuse and stretches in prison for the majority of his life. Fortunately, Morgan's playing in 2003 remains untouched by his personal habits. These eight tracks are a nice combination of ballads including &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; with raucous versions of Coltrane's &quot;Impressions&quot; and the Charlie Parker vehicle &quot;Cherokee.&quot; Morgan is featured on alto saxophone throughout, accompanied by an excellent trio of jazz stalwarts who have frequently collaborated over the years: George Cables on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass, and Billy Hart on drums. These musicians work collective wonders and consistently inspire Morgan, making this set highly recommended.\n\n_____________________________\n\nNot my rip but not widely available so I'm seeding it here.
