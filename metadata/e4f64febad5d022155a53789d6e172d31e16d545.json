How to Survive a Robot Uprising is partially based on scientific fact, and is a prime example of deadpan humor.\n\nWired magazine gave it a 2006 Rave Award, calling it: equal parts sci-fi send-up and technical primer. Macleans called the book: very funny and highly informative.\n\nIn 2007, the American Library Association designated the book a 2007 ALA: Popular Paperback for Young Adults.\n\nWilson received a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon Universitys Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Paramount Pictures optioned film rights to the book and hired Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (both members of the State comedy troupe and co-creators of the Reno 911! television series) to write a script based on the book. On April 26, 2006 comedian Mike Myers signed with Paramount to star in the 2008 movie adaptation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f64febad5d022155a53789d6e172d31e16d545","amp;dn":"How+to+Survive+a+Robot+Uprising+-+Daniel+H.+Wilson+-+56+kbps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f64febad5d022155a53789d6e172d31e16d545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,246,79,235,173,93,2,33,85,165,55,137,214,225,114,211,30,22,213,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
