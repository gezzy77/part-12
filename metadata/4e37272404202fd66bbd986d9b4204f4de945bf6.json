It explores the sweep of US military actions at home and abroad, from the initial clashes between militias and Native American tribes to contemporary operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The text provides both macro- and micro- views of military history, providing historical context for each conflict as well as incorporating personal vignettes from soldiers, civilians, and others affected by instances of military action. Chapters also explore elements of cultural, social, political, economic, and technological developments in relationship to military history, as well as topics including patterns of national service, the evolution of civil-military relations, and the advent of all-volunteer forces. Straightforward and eminently readable, The American Military offers revealing insights into the many ways in which armed conflicts have shaped the course of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history.\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nBrad D.
