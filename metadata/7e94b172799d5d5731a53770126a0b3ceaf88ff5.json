The Samsung Gear Live smartwatch puts many of the features Android users have come to expect (music, calendar, and apps) right on your wrist, and it integrates with Google Now, a built-in digital assistant with voice-command functionality. This course provides a first-hand look at the Android Wear platform and the Samsung Gear Live's features and functionality. Author Nick Brazzi explains how to best set up your Android Wear device, highlights its coolest features, and shows how it works with both native and third-party apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e94b172799d5d5731a53770126a0b3ceaf88ff5","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Android+Wear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e94b172799d5d5731a53770126a0b3ceaf88ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,148,177,114,121,157,93,87,49,165,55,112,18,106,11,60,234,248,143,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
