Providing detailed current information on construction materials for sustainable sites, the book introduces tools, techniques, ideologies and resources for evaluating, sourcing, and specifying sustainable site materials. Chapters cover types of materials, both conventional and emerging green materials, environmental and human health impacts of the material, and detailed strategies to minimize these impacts. Case studies share cost and performance information and lessons learned.\n\nContent from this book is available as an online continuing professional education course at http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-320255.html#resource_efficiency.
