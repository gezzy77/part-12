(from the booklet)\n\nAbout this release:\nIn addition to the Ann Arbor concert contained here in its entirety, this release also includes five bonus tracks recorded at The Tiffany Club in L.A. on August 10, 1954. The aforementioned tunes Line for Lyons and My Old Flame are added here as well as Baker's sole recordings of Hanley's Zing Went the Strings of My Heart, Charlie Parker's My Little Suede Shoes, and the debut recording of his celebrated hit Everything Happens to Me by Dennis &amp; Adair!\n&quot;I play every set as if it were the final one. It has been like this for years. I don't have too much time left, and it's important to show the musicians I'm playing with -more than anybody else- that I give everything I've got in me. And that I expect them to do the same. &quot;\nChet Baker\n\nTrack list:\n01 Announcement\n02 Line for Lyons\n03 Lover Man\n04 My Funny Valentine\n05 Maid in Mexico\n06 Stella by Starlight\n07 My Old Flame\n08 Headline\n09 Russ Job\n10 Zing Went the Strings of My Heart (*)\n11 My Little Suede Shoes (*)\n12 Line for Lyons (*)\n13 My Old Flame (*)\n14 Everything Happens to Me (*)\nTotal Time: 75:36 (*) Bonus Tracks\n\nCHET BAKER trumpet\nRUSS FREEMAN piano\nCARSON SMITH bass\nBOB NEEL drums\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba3271a372189701ca70fe2ad51207091f164ab","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+1954+-+Jazz+At+Ann+Arbor+%282012%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba3271a372189701ca70fe2ad51207091f164ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,163,39,26,55,33,137,112,28,167,15,226,173,81,32,112,145,241,100,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
