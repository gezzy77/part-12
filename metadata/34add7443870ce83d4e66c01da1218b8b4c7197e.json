When used in coordination with other tools for ensuring information security, cryptography in all of its applications, including data confidentiality, data integrity, and user authentication, is a most powerful tool for protecting information. This book presents a collection of research work in the field of cryptography. It discusses some of the critical challenges that are being faced by the current computing world and also describes some mechanisms to defend against these challenges. It is a valuable source of knowledge for researchers, engineers, graduate and doctoral students working in the field of cryptography. It will also be useful for faculty members of graduate schools and universities.\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34add7443870ce83d4e66c01da1218b8b4c7197e","amp;dn":"Theory+and+Practice+of+Cryptography+and+Network+Security+Protoco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34add7443870ce83d4e66c01da1218b8b4c7197e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,173,215,68,56,112,206,131,212,230,108,1,218,18,24,184,180,199,25,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
