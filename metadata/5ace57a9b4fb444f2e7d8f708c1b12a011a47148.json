That's not hyperbole. These tapes, which consist of two live recordings and one studio demo, were cut, presumably, between 1957 and 1958, with various groupings of musicians, including his brothers Monk and Buddy, as well as pianist Earl Van Riper and bassist Mingo Jones. All of the tunes here are now regarded as standards, but some were current then, freshly added in that era, such as Shorty Rogers' &quot;Diablo's Dance,&quot; Horace Silver's &quot;Nica's Dream,&quot; and perhaps most importantly, Thelonious Monk's &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; and &quot;Straight No Chaser.&quot;\n\nThe first full album of previously unheard Wes Montgomery music in over 25 years contains studio &amp; live performances recorded in Indianapolis 1957 1958! Includes four tracks recorded at Indianapolis s famed club, The Hub Bub. 24-page booklet with family photographs provided by the Montgomery family. Liner notes by some of music s most respected writers including Dan Morgenstern, David N. Baker, Bill Milkowski, Michael Cuscuna, and others. Classic 50s photos of Wes taken in Indianapolis by legendary photographer Duncan Scheidt. Previously unpublished essay by Wes brother, Buddy Montgomery. Rare interview with Wes s brother Monk Montgomery from 1980\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
