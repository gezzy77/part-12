A pretty enjoyable album, with a few tracks to keep in a permanent library.\nThis album has some really fresh styles across ranging through the gamut of happy hardcore all the way to some bangin' gabber -- a nice treat in the piss-stained generic and bland swamplands of the modern music industry.\n\n\nI enjoy the entirety of this album, though a few tracks stand out popularity-wise:\nSerotonin 2008 (Trance/Hardcore) - Joshka/JAKAZiD, some really incredible synth buildups. Joshka's highest last.fm track by far.\n\nCross Breeding (Hardcore) - REDALiCE, named such because it twists from dark and intense riffs to a happy-hardcore bridge in the middle and back again. Fun track, the second-highest ranking track on REDALiCE's long-term last.fm playcounts. That means its good =P\n\nThe third track of popular note is Olive (Hard Trance) - Umbrella, his highest play-count track on last.fm. Enjoyable, though I wouldn't say mind-blowing.\n\n\n\n01. Serotonin 2008 - Joshka\n02. Orion - Ryu*\n03. Cross Breeding - REDALiCE\n04. Steampunk - DX Pasta\n05. Tribute to Emptiness ~For Nothing~ - DJ Technorch\n06. tc-ma_009 - DJ-Technetium\n07. Void - Alabaster\n08. Make me Feel - Minamotoya\n09. Olive - Umbrella\n10. You Are Never Alone on the Dancefloor - kenta-v.ez.\n11. City of Traitors - Betwixt &amp; Between\n12. No Eyes - RoughSketch\n13. Unstable shake - USAO\n14. To Luv Me I *** For U - t+pazolite\n\n\nAlso, pretty nice album cover.\n\nTAGS:\nhardcore, syndrome, jcore, electronic, dance, music, happy, gabber, trance, house, japanese, bemani, redalice, ryu, usao ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a5118d2904aa4988147e9c48d77ce09c70d83bf","amp;dn":"Hardcore+Syndrome+2+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BTANOCD-0009%5D+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a5118d2904aa4988147e9c48d77ce09c70d83bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,81,24,210,144,74,164,152,129,71,233,196,141,119,206,9,199,13,131,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
