It was their 5th studio release. Paul Rodgers revealed on In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an episode to Desolation Angels) that the album's title came from the novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac.\n\nDesolation Angels was recorded at Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey, England in late 1978.\n\nIt is considered the last strong album by Bad Company, mostly because it contains their last major hit, &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy,&quot; written by Paul Rodgers which its inspiration came from a guitar synthesizer riff that Rodgers came up with.\n\n&quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot;, written by bassist Boz Burrell, also received substantial airplay on rock stations. It was the first of only three songs he ever wrote for the band, but is widely revered as one of the band's finest compositions.\n\nThe album reached No. 3 on the Billboard album charts in 1979 and went Platinum in 1979 and Double Platinum subsequently.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Crazy Circles&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:32\n    &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; (Boz Burrell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n    &quot;Evil Wind&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:45\n    &quot;Lonely for Your Love&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:26\n    &quot;Oh, Atlanta&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n    &quot;Take the Time&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n    &quot;Rhythm Machine&quot; (Simon Kirke/Boz Burrell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:44\n    &quot;She Brings Me Love&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, piano, synthesisers\n    Mick RalphsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, keyboards\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Boz Burrell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612f750e06fb98a4bc6d2ec28f8aa1f13be77ad0","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+-+Desolation+Angels+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612f750e06fb98a4bc6d2ec28f8aa1f13be77ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,47,117,14,6,251,152,164,188,109,46,194,143,138,161,241,59,231,122,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
