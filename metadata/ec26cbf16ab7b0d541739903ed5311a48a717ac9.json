In 2003, the album was ranked number 344 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, though the magazine had called the album a &quot;disaster&quot; 30 years prior.\nThe album is a tragic rock opera about a doomed couple, and addresses themes of drug use, prostitution, depression, domestic violence, and suicide.\n&quot;The Kids&quot; tells of Caroline having her children taken from her by the authorities, and features the sounds of children shouting for their mother. UK group The Waterboys takes its name from a line in this song.\nMusically, Berlin differs greatly from the bulk of Reed's work, due to the use of heavy orchestral arrangements, horns, and top session musicians. Instrumentally, Reed himself only contributes acoustic guitar.\n\n=========================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 Berlin.flac\nA2 Lady Day.flac\nA3 Men Of Good Fortune.flac\nA4 Caroline Says I.flac\nA5 How Do You Think It Feels.flac\nA6 Oh, Jim.flac\nB1 Caroline Says II.flac\nB2 The Kids.flac\nB3 The Bed.flac\nB4 Sad Song.flac\n\n===========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.05GB\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 852 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Berlin {Original US}\nTrack name/Position                      : 05\nPerformer                                : Lou Reed\nGenre                                    : Psychedelic Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1973\nEngineer                                 : Boticario boti\n\n=======================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 852 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec26cbf16ab7b0d541739903ed5311a48a717ac9","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed+%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Berlin+%281973%29+-+%7BUS+Original%7D%5BFlac%5D%7B24bit+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec26cbf16ab7b0d541739903ed5311a48a717ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,38,203,241,106,183,176,213,65,115,153,3,237,83,17,164,138,113,122,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
