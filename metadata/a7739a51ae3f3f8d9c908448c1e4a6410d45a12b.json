The universal tendency he shows is to see spirituality as a process of self-improvementÃ¢â‚¬â€the impulse to develop and refine the ego when the ego is by nature essentially empty. &quot;The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use&quot; he said &quot;even spirituality.&quot; His incisive compassionate teachings serve to wake us up from this trick we all play on ourselves and to offer us a far brighter reality: the true and joyous liberation that inevitably involves letting go of the self rather than working to improve it. It is a message that has resonated with students for nearly thirty years and remains fresh as ever today. This new edition includes a foreword by ChÃƒÂ¶gyam Trungpa's son and lineage holder Sakyong Mipham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7739a51ae3f3f8d9c908448c1e4a6410d45a12b","amp;dn":"Cutting+Through+Spiritual+Materialism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7739a51ae3f3f8d9c908448c1e4a6410d45a12b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,115,154,81,174,63,63,141,156,144,132,72,193,228,166,65,13,69,161,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
