When malaria strikes, the lives of these very different women change forever. They forge a deep friendship and embark on an epic journey of self-discovery to Africa, dedicating themselves to the cause of malaria prevention. Beginning to rebuild their lives, they show how ordinary people can make a difference and inspire positive change in the process. Enlisting the help of MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estranged father, a former politico, the two women beseech both the powers that be and ordinary people to get involved, realizing a shared responsibility to all the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2284766/\nRelease Date: 1 March 2013 (UK)\nGenre: Drama\nStars : Hilary Swank, Brenda Blethyn, Sam Claflin\nQuality: 720p WEB-DL\nEncoder: SHQ@Ganool\nSource: 720p.WEB-DL.H264-PHD\nSize: 700MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2ecdb9880f4d879608f9f9907581ea9edbb398d","amp;dn":"Mary+And+Martha+%282013%29+720p+WEB-DL+700MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2ecdb9880f4d879608f9f9907581ea9edbb398d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,236,219,152,128,244,216,121,96,143,159,153,7,88,30,169,237,187,57,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
