My intention with this avi files was to reduce size of files to the minimal without noticeable lost of sound and picture quality. I used vob files from Abraham-Hicks 1993-05-16 Albuquerque, NM VHS to DVD torrent.\n\nThe avi quality and size was achieved by adjusting brightness, contrast, saturationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and cropping the picture by 4% to 8% (to remove the disturbing tape noise). Result: The experience when watching the avi files seem to be a better than when watching the vob files.\n\nThere are 9 sessions on 5 VHS tapes. Each DVD rip is a session, therefore there are 9 avi files and 9 mp3s. \n\nSome audio of these recordings goes up and down on the vob files but I have adjusted some of it in mp3 rips and trimmed the beginnings and the ends where video is needed to understand what is going on. \n\nThis and some other materiel was a result from a request for a Group-Buy at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/abrahamhickstorrents/project&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/abrahamhickstorrents/project&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more Abraham-Hicks_Torrents see webpage at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/abrahamhickstorrents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/abrahamhickstorrents&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI have enjoyed the flow of energy in making these rips,\n\nWally\n\n\nJerry &amp; Esther Hicks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor over 20 years Esther &amp; Jerry Hicks have published hundreds of books, audio recordings and videos, and have conducted up to 60 workshops a year.
