Idealistic and uncompromising, if short on cash, he planned to engage himself in a low-paying menial job by day and to compose poetical masterpieces by night. Having promised himself he would never succumb to such stop-gap occupations as publishing or advertising, he was happily unsuccessful in landing in either job - at least initially. Positions with London Transport and as a wine expert were likewise denied him. Scarcely daunted, he moved purposefully beyond 'the Valley of Kangaroos' (otherwise known as Earl's Court) into a bed and breakfast in a Swiss Cottage where he thoughtfully practised the Twist in his room, anticipated the poetical masterpieces and worried a little about his wardrobe.
