This is the unabridged version read by Hugh Laurie.  228 minutes.\n\nPersonally, I thought the book was just okay, but the audio version is hilariously dramatized by Hugh Laurie complete with a myriad of accents and characterizations.  \n\nFrom Amazon.co.uk:\nAlexander McCall Smith, best-selling author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has turned his hand to humour. The delightful result is a creation of comic genius. For in the unnaturally tall form of Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, we are invited to meet a memorable character whose sublime insouciance is a blend of the cultivated pomposity of Frasier Crane and of Inspecteur Clouseau's hapless gaucherie. Von Igelfeld inhabits the rarefied world of the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, a world he shares with his equally tall and equally ridiculous colleagues, Professors Florianus Prinzel and Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Their unlikely adventures are described in three deliciously funny instalments: Portuguese Irregular Verbs, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f26b2658d391469e9d5a1de1bdf00e6fac9333","amp;dn":"Portuguese+Irregular+Verbs+by+Alexander+McCall+Smith+read+by+Hug","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f26b2658d391469e9d5a1de1bdf00e6fac9333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,242,107,38,88,211,145,70,158,157,90,29,225,189,240,14,111,172,147,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
