You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need network access, and you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to download any special imaging software.\n\nJust download this torrent, open the zip file and copy the contents of the NOOBS_v1.3.9 folder onto a freshly formatted 4GB (or larger) SD card. When you boot up for the first time, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see a menu prompting you to install one of several operating systems into the free space on the card. The choice means you can boot the Pi with a regular operating system like Raspbian, or with a media-centre specific OS like RaspBMC, OpenElec etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e89aaf8cbb88538f849ee6c4add2e730661741a","amp;dn":"Raspberry+Pi+NOOBS+v1.3.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e89aaf8cbb88538f849ee6c4add2e730661741a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,137,170,248,203,184,133,56,248,73,238,108,74,221,46,115,6,97,116,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
