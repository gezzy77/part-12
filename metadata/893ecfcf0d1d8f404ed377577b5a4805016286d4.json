In her tours she sensed the rebellious spirit and wanted to trace its origins in Arabic poetry. Banna chose &quot;Arabic Mystic poems from ancient to modern times, performed in the age of rebellion&quot; of Tunisian, Palestinian, Iraqi and Persian and Andalusian writers in the hope that the ecstatic spirit of freedom and human camaraderie will shine where the light of freedom has not shone yet. \n\nMP3: 320 CBR Kbps\nfornt cover only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893ecfcf0d1d8f404ed377577b5a4805016286d4","amp;dn":"Rim+Banna+-+Revelation+of+Ecstasy+and+Rebellion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893ecfcf0d1d8f404ed377577b5a4805016286d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,62,207,207,13,29,143,64,78,211,119,87,123,90,72,5,1,98,134,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
