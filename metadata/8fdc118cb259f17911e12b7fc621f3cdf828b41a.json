Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe Breast is a novella by Philip Roth, in which the main character,\nDavid Kepesh, becomes a 155-pound breast. Throughout the book Kepesh \nfights with himself. Part of him wishes to give in to bodily desires, \nwhile the other part of him wants to be rational. Kepesh, a literature \nprofessor, compares his plight with that of fictional characters such as \nGregor Samsa in Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis and Kovalyov in \nNikolai Gogol's short story &quot;The Nose&quot;. Throughout the novel, he \ndescribes the various sexual and physical feelings he has while people \nhandle him, while initiating sex with his girlfriend, and while he is \nalone.\nDuring a stay on the beach with his girlfriend, Claire, Kepesh had \nwished to have breasts, to be a breast, and he struggles with the idea \nthat apparently this wish was fulfilled while other more important \nwishes were not.\n\n - - -\n\nFrom BrillianceAudio.fail\n\nLike a latter-day Gregor Samsa, Professor David Kepesh wakes up one \nmorning to find that he has been transformed. But where KafkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nprotagonist turned into a giant beetle, the narrator of Philip RothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nrichly conceived fantasy has become a 155-pound female breast. What \nfollows is a deliriously funny yet touching exploration of the full \nimplications of KepeshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metamorphosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a daring, heretical book that \nbrings us face to face with the intrinsic strangeness of sex and \nsubjectivity. \n\nTechnically at least, THE BREAST seems to me Roth's best book so far. \nThe humor and pathos (it has fair amounts of both) come from his solid \ngrasp of how life is, his firm knowledge of the importance of strength \nof character and the will to live... THE BREAST is terrific for a thing \nof its kind: inventive and sane and very funny, though filthy of \ncourse... It's incredible, in fact, how smart he is for a man so hung \nup with his you-know-what...\n&quot;The Breast is terrific... inventive and sane and very funny. The trick\nwhich is the heart of the book is brilliant... and rich with meaning.&quot;\n-- John Gardner, New York Times Book Review, 07/17/1972\n\n\n&quot;Hilarious, serious, visionary, logical, sexual-philosophical; the \nending amazesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the joke takes three steps beyond savagery and satire and \nturns into a sublimeness of pity. One knows when one is reading \nsomething that will permanently enter the culture.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cynthia Ozick    \n\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n&gt;&gt;The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdc118cb259f17911e12b7fc621f3cdf828b41a","amp;dn":"THE+BREAST+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+David+Colacci+%7BFerraBit%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fdc118cb259f17911e12b7fc621f3cdf828b41a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,220,17,140,178,89,241,121,17,225,43,127,198,33,243,205,248,40,180,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
