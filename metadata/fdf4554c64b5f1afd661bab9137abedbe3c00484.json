Moby Dick\r\n2. Heartbreaker\r\n3. Whole Lotta Love\r\n4. Dancing Days (fades at 2:35)\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThese are only the last four songs from the show and all that is known \r\nto exist from it. Robert's voice sounds really damaged but the band is \r\nunreal in Whole Lotta Love and Jimmy's soloing in Heartbreaker is \r\nbreathtaking. This is the only time Dancing Days was played on the US \r\nTour in 1973 and the last time it was ever played in electric form ... \r\nit would show up in the acoustic sections of 1977!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf4554c64b5f1afd661bab9137abedbe3c00484","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.07.13+Detroit%2C+Michigan+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf4554c64b5f1afd661bab9137abedbe3c00484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,244,85,76,100,181,241,175,214,97,186,185,19,122,190,219,227,192,4,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
