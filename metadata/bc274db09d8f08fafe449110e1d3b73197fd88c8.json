He was a close friend of C. S. LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\n\nAfter his death, Tolkien's son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about an imagined world called Arda, and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.\n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the &quot;father&quot; of modern fantasy literatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, The Times ranked him sixth on a list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;. Forbes ranked him the 5th top-earning dead celebrity in 2009.\n\nMP3 Audio-books\nThe Hobbit\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\nThe Two Towers\nReturn of the King\nThe Silmarillion\nThe Children of Hurin\nThe Annals of Kings and Rulers\n\nMP4 Audio-books\nThe Hobbit\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\nThe Two Towers\nReturn of the King\n\nMovies\nThe Lord of the Rings Extended Editions (MP4 and AVI formats)\n\tThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\tThe Two Towers\n\tReturn of the King\nThe Bored of the Rings (LOTR Parody) (DVD pieces)\nTolkien in Oxford (FLV format)\nLord of the Rings Animated Films (AVI and M4V formats)\n\tThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\tThe Two Towers\n\tReturn of the King\n\nMusic\nLOTR Motion Picture Soundtracks\n\tThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\tThe Two Towers\n\tReturn of the King\nDavid Arkenstone - Music Inspired by Middle Earth\nRick Wakeman - Landscapes of Middle Earth\nThe Tolkien Ensemble\n\tThe Complete Songs and Poems (4 CDs)\n\tAn Evening in Rivendell\n\tA Night in Rivendell\n\tAt Dawn in Rivendell\n\tLeaving Rivendell\nTolkien Reading His Own Works (38 tracks)\n\nWritten Works\nCollected Poems of J.R.R.
