However, few, if any, are totally devoted to power distribution engineering, and none of them are true textbooks. Filling this vacuum in the power system engineering literature, Electric Power Distribution System Engineering broke new ground.\r\n\r\nWritten in the classic, self-learning style of the original, Electric Power Distribution Engineering, Third Edition is updated and expanded with:\r\n\r\n- Over 180 detailed numerical examples\r\n- More than 170 end-of-chapter problems\r\n- New MATLABÂ® applications\r\n\r\nThe Third Edition also features new chapters on:\r\n\r\n- Distributed generation\r\n- Renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar energies)\r\n- Modern energy storage systems\r\n- Smart grids and their applications\r\n\r\nDesigned specifically for junior- or senior-level electrical engineering courses, the book covers all aspects of distribution engineering from basic system planning and concepts through distribution system protection and reliability. Drawing on decades of experience to provide a text that is as attractive to students as it is useful to professors and practicing engineers, the author demonstrates how to design, analyze, and perform modern distribution system engineering. He takes special care to cover industry terms and symbols, providing a glossary and clearly defining each term when it is introduced. The discussion of distribution planning and design considerations goes beyond the usual analytical and qualitative analysis to emphasize the economical explication and overall impact of the distribution design considerations discussed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf96ad08a37bfd51ed7377e36c77c76f47b4259","amp;dn":"Electric+Power+Distribution+Engineering%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf96ad08a37bfd51ed7377e36c77c76f47b4259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,249,106,208,138,55,191,213,30,215,55,126,54,199,124,118,244,123,66,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
