The group's dark proto-industrial sounds were first put to wax that year in the form of a two-song EP simply entitled Tombs, and by the time the group got around to unleashing a proper full-length for Relapse, 2009's Winter Hours, Seita and Ennis had been replaced with Carson James and Andrew Hernandez (Asra), respectively.\n\nThe band's sophomore outing, 2011's Paths Of Totality, was produced by John Congleton (Baroness, Explosions In The Sky), and featured prominently on many critics' year-end metal lists including Pitchfork, Brooklyn Vegan, Decibel Magazine, NPR, MetalSucks, and many more.\n\nIn addition to their critically acclaimed releases, Tombs has become revered for their captivating live shows and have toured extensively with an array of artists as eclectic as their sound, trekking throughout North American and Europe with groups ranging from Eyehategod and Isis to Wormrot and Ulcerate.\n\n\n2014 Savage Gold\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Thanatos&quot; 4:25\n2. &quot;Portraits&quot; 6:50\n3. &quot;Seance&quot; 5:29\n4. &quot;Echoes&quot; 7:56\n5. &quot;Deathtripper&quot; 6:44\n6. &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; 5:28\n7. &quot;Ashes&quot; 5:03\n8. &quot;Legacy&quot; 4:18\n9. &quot;Severed Lives&quot; 4:42\n10. &quot;Spiral&quot; 6:17           .................................It has a Metal sound to it so I proclaim to be Metal: Now everyone can get it......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f484bcbe18dd9b466c015fa3b5984ca9d1ccb3b5","amp;dn":"Tombs+-+Savage+Gold++mp3++320k++++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f484bcbe18dd9b466c015fa3b5984ca9d1ccb3b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,132,188,190,24,221,155,70,108,1,95,163,181,152,76,169,209,204,179,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
