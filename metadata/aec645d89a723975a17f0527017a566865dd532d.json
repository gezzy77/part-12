This is what Hawkeye does on Thursday afternoon.&quot;\n\n------\n\nThe breakout star of 2012's blockbuster Avengers film and self-made hero Hawkeye fights for justice! With ex-Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he's out to prove himself as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes! SHIELD recruits Clint to intercept a packet of incriminating evidence - before he becomes the most wanted man in the world. You won't believe what is on The Tape! What is the Vagabond Code? Matt Fraction and David Aja (Immortal Iron Fist) reunite to tell a Hawkeye thriller that spans the globe ... and the darkest parts of Hawkeye's mind. Barton and Bishop mean double the Hawkeye and double the trouble ... and stealing from the rich never looked so good.\n\n------\n\nSTFmaryville says: This title is surely one of the front-runners for the next &quot;Best New Series&quot; Eisner Award. All credit goes to theRevolutionaries-Novus for doing an outstanding job scanning every month, and to RubrumPopulus and blackcanary for posting these on TPB. Oh yeah, and now the part I always steal from blackcanary:\n\n------\n\nThis torrent includes both 1440px and 2048px-HD versions  \n*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.
