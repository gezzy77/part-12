The Story: Billionaire John Farrington is obsessed with the idea of offending God to the point that God would want to confront him in person. Farrington has abducted priests and nuns to commit sexual atrocities with the most grievously genetically deformed people he can find. People that he's also abducted and kept in such a high state of sexual intensity, with a drug his company produces, that they are just ravenous for physical contact. The abductees, with basically no self control, commit some of the most depraved sex acts, over, and over again. Westmore and Bryant, a photographer and journalist, are given the rare opportunity to interview the reclusive Farrington and see inside his mansion and operation. Only to find the horrors within, and who have become pawns in the mysteries they find behind every door. Farmington's plan may work, and to make sure he's successful, he will do whatever it takes to have the deity of man face him.\n\nMessenger by Edward Lee\nA demon takes over a post office, leaving unsuspecting victims with a surprise when they open their packages.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8f0b8aca654bcbb4541a54e0c18fe921c2b97d","amp;dn":"5+books+by+Edward+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8f0b8aca654bcbb4541a54e0c18fe921c2b97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,143,11,138,202,101,75,203,180,84,26,84,224,193,143,233,33,194,185,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
