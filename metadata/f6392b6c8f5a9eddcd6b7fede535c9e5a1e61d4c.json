Thirteen hundred years ago it was the greatest centre of learning in the whole of Christendom and the very cradle of English consciousness. In the time of Lewis Carroll it was the greatest shipbuilding port in the world. To this city that gave the world the electric light bulb, the stars and stripes, the millennium, the Liberty Ships and the greatest British dragon legend came Carroll in the years preceding his most famous book, Alice in Wonderland, and here are buried the roots of his surreal masterpiece. Enter the famous Edwardian palace of varieties, The Sunderland Empire, for a unique experience: an entertaining and epic meditation on myth, history and storytelling and decide for yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½does Sunderland really exist?\n\nFrom Bryan Talbot, the acclaimed creator of The Adventures of Luther Arkwright and The Tale of One Bad Rat, comes Alice in Sunderland, a graphic novel unlike any other. Funny and poignant, thought-provoking and entertaining, traditional and experimental, whimsical and polemical, Alice in Sunderland is a heady cocktail of fact and fiction, a sumptuous and multi-layered journey that will leave you wondering about the magic thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s waiting to be unlocked in the place where you live.  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bryan-talbot.com/alice/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bryan-talbot.com/alice/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Sunderland&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jun/09/travel.travelbooks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jun/09/travel.travelbooks&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6392b6c8f5a9eddcd6b7fede535c9e5a1e61d4c","amp;dn":"Alice+in+Sunderland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6392b6c8f5a9eddcd6b7fede535c9e5a1e61d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,57,43,108,143,90,158,221,205,107,127,237,229,53,201,229,161,230,29,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
