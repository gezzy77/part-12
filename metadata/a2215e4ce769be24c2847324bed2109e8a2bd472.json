They are learning to think, in other words, and to thrive in the modern economy.\n\nWhat is it like to be a child in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new education superpowers?\n\nIn a global quest to find answers for our own children, author and Time magazine journalist Amanda Ripley follows three Americans embedÃ‚Â­ded in these countries for one year. Kim, fifteen, raises $10,000 so she can move from Oklahoma to Finland; Eric, eighteen, exchanges a high-achieving Minnesota suburb for a booming city in South Korea; and Tom, seventeen, leaves a historic Pennsylvania village for Poland.\n\nThrough these young informants, Ripley meets battle-scarred reformers, sleep-deprived zombie students, and a teacher who earns $4 million a year. Their stories, along with groundbreaking research into learning in other cultures, reveal a pattern of startling transformation: none of these countries had many Ã¢â‚¬Å“smartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ kids a few decades ago. Things had changed. Teaching had become more rigorous; parents had focused on things that mattered; and children had bought into the promise of education.\n\nA journalistic tour de force, The Smartest Kids in the World is a book about building resilience in a new worldÃ¢â‚¬â€as told by the young Americans who have the most at stake\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2215e4ce769be24c2847324bed2109e8a2bd472","amp;dn":"Amanda+Ripley%2C+The+Smartest+Kids+in+the+World+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2215e4ce769be24c2847324bed2109e8a2bd472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,33,94,76,231,105,190,36,194,132,115,36,190,210,16,158,138,43,212,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
