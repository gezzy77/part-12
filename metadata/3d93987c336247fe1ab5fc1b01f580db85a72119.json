Full Descriptioncomedian's comedian, skewering the inanity of modern life with detachment and stoned, articulate wit. Carlin's take has changed a bit over the years. Instead of slying sending up the little absurdities of life and language, the older Carlin has largely substituted rage for bemusement. This certainly changes the flavor of his comedy. But Carlin is still never less than feverishly inspired, and he's often extremely funny.\n\nCarlin is utterly unfettered by notions of political corrections. His humor is profane, scatological, and insulting to nearly everyone at some point or another. YOU'RE ALL DISEASED is a live recording of a 1998 cable TV special, and the disc captures Carlin at his apoplectic best. Whether he's decrying the idiocy of swabbing off prisoners' arms before they receive a lethal injection, bemoaning the popularity of angels, or lambasting parents for thinking their kids are cuter than they are, Carlin deftly mines the landscape of human annoyance.\n\nParental Advisory,Parental Advisory,Parental Advisory,Parental Advisory,Parental Advisory\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d93987c336247fe1ab5fc1b01f580db85a72119","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+%28You%5C%27re+All+Diseased%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d93987c336247fe1ab5fc1b01f580db85a72119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,147,152,124,51,98,71,254,26,181,252,27,1,245,128,219,133,167,33,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
