How to Design and Write Web Pages Today offers an approach for building sites that reach your intended audience, using methods that enable a site to be updated and improved over time.\nAn introduction to standards-based Web design, this book treats creating a website from the point of view of the writer, focusing on writing concerns and how they fit with the technological challenges of the Web. Readers will learn about the reasons for writing on the Web; the challenges of writing there; and the solid, but flexible construction of individual pages. The focus is on building websites that can grow, including sites built around the popular, open-source WordPress blogging system. Rich with examples, the book demonstrates that Web writing and design can be fast and funÃ¢â‚¬â€and accomplished without expensive software or sophisticated programming skills.\n\nAbout the Author\nKarl Stolley is an associate professor of digital writing and rhetoric at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, where he teaches graduate courses on Web design, information architecture, and the rhetoric of technology.
