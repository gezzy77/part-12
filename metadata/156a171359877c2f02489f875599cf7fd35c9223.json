His cyber - security company is flourishing, and his relationship with Daryl Haugen intensifies when she becomes a part of his team.\nBut the West is under the EastÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest threat yet. The Stuxnet virus that successfully subverted IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nuclear defense program for years is being rapidly identified and defeated, and StuxnetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creators are stressed to develop a successor. As Jeff and Daryl struggle to stay together, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re summoned to disarm the attack of a revolutionary, invisible trojan that alters data without leaving a trace. As the trojan penetrates Western intelligence, the terrifying truth about Iran is revealed, and Jeff and Daryl find themselves running a desperate race against time to reverse it - while the fate of both East and West hangs in the balance.\nLike Zero Day, Trojan Horse is a thrilling suspense story, a sober warning from one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading experts on cyber-security, MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Technology Fellow, Mark Russinovich. Trojan Horse demystifies the dangerously realistic threat of a cyber-terrorism attack on the Western world, while chronicling the lengths through which one man and will go to stop it.\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                         Note: No Table of Contents\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156a171359877c2f02489f875599cf7fd35c9223","amp;dn":"Trojan+Horse+by+Mark+Russinovich+%28Zero+Day+Book+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156a171359877c2f02489f875599cf7fd35c9223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,106,23,19,89,135,124,47,2,72,159,135,85,153,207,127,211,92,146,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
