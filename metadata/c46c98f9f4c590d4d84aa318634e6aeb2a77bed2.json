With dad preoccupied with work, mom on edge, and self-involved teens Nick and Natalie fixated on their ever-growing wish lists, the youngest, six-year-old Nina, is the only one with any true Christmas spirit.\n\nWhen their dad loses his job just before the holidays, the family ignores the severity of the situation and continues to live above their means. When the consequences catch up with them, they are left with nothing and nowhere to turn. Taken in by an eccentric Christmas tree farmer, the family learns that miracles can come trueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if you believe!\n\nStars: Kevin Sizemore (Resurrection), Terry Kiser (Weekend at Bernie's) and Jill Whelan (The Love Boat)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46c98f9f4c590d4d84aa318634e6aeb2a77bed2","amp;dn":"A+Christmas+Tree+Miracle+2013+UPtv+PDTV+x264-Hector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46c98f9f4c590d4d84aa318634e6aeb2a77bed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,108,152,249,244,197,144,212,216,74,163,24,99,78,106,235,42,119,190,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
