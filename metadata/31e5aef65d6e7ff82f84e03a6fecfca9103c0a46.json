Plasma\n\n\n          In the past three years Heyoka has been taking elements of Glitch Hop, Grime, Drum &amp; Bass and Dubstep and turned them on their heads repeatedly and emerging at times like the audio conversion of synthesized dimethyltryptamine and other times creating walls of sound that provide a full body massage and relieve pressure on the extremities. One undeniably consistent element that is heard from anywhere he has toured or been submitted for review, is that the Heyoka experience is a bass lovers delight.\n\n          His albums tend to be evolutions of certain parameters on self created sound pallets and genre experimentations. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Cosmic BoogieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ he carries on where he left off delving into Halfstep and some Drum &amp; Bass on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MarklarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. This time he also embraces old-skool beats like the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“amenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ loop while staying true to style, he edits the hell out of them and adds his own distinctive flavor.\nHeyoka has been on the road steadily and his growth as a performer is evident in his ability to reinterpret his music to various dancefloors and circumstances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31e5aef65d6e7ff82f84e03a6fecfca9103c0a46","amp;dn":"Heyoka+-+Cosmic+Boogie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31e5aef65d6e7ff82f84e03a6fecfca9103c0a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,229,174,246,93,110,127,248,47,132,224,58,111,236,252,169,16,60,10,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
