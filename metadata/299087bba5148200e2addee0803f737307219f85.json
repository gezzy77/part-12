But there have been far worse efforts from other performers in this vein, and there's a cool, giddy fun at work throughout that makes it a fine listen. \nThe inspired range of covers reaches from glam-era landmarks (Roxy Music's &quot;Sea Breezes,&quot; John Cale's &quot;Gun&quot;) to Billie Holiday's sorrowful touchstone &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; to, in one of the best such efforts ever (and a year before Hal Willner's Stay Awake project), a Disney classic -- namely the slinky &quot;Trust in Me,&quot; originally from The Jungle Book and given a spare, mostly-Budgie backing that could almost be a sparkling Creatures outtake. \nSome takes are more or less direct clones without much to add -- Sparks' &quot;This Town Isn't Big Enough for Both of Us&quot; misses the sheer hysteria that Russell Mael brought to the original, but Iggy Pop's &quot;The Passenger&quot; adds a bit of horn-section punch and lets Siouxsie demonstrate her ability with calm, dismissive cool. \nTurning Kraftwerk's empty, haunted &quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot; into a much more propulsive, Morricone guitar-tinged number makes for a fine reinvention, though, while Bob Dylan-via-Julie Driscoll's &quot;This Wheel's on Fire&quot; made for an enjoyable, string-touched single from the album. \nAnd if anyone needed proof that the Banshees were obsessive fan types when they started, the concluding cover of Television's debut obscurity &quot;Little Johnny Jewel&quot; would provide it.
