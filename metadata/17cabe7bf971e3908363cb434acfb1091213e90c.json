The title character is Arizona rancher and aircraft pilot Schuyler &quot;Sky&quot; King. The series is likely based on a true-life personality of the 1930s, Jack Cones, the &quot;Flying Constable&quot; of Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino County, California, although this claim is unverified.[1]\n\nAlthough the series has strong western elements, King mostly captures criminals and spies and finds lost hikers with the use of his airplane, the Songbird. Although the airplanes that were used were changed during the course of the series, the later model was not given a number, but was still known as the Songbird.\n\nKing and his niece, Penny (and sometimes Clipper, his nephew), live on the Flying Crown Ranch, near the (fictitious) town of Grover, Arizona. Penny and Clipper are also pilots, although they are inexperienced and look to their uncle for guidance. Penny is an accomplished air racer and rates as a multi-engine pilot, whom Sky trusts to fly the Songbird. In the third TV episode, Penny refers to Clipper as &quot;my brother.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_king&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_king&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sky-king/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/shows/sky-king/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGive thanks to the American taxpayer - this DVD came from the public library!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cabe7bf971e3908363cb434acfb1091213e90c","amp;dn":"Sky+King+-+1950%27s+Adventure+Series+%7B4+Episodes+-+DVD+Rip%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cabe7bf971e3908363cb434acfb1091213e90c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,202,190,123,249,113,227,144,131,99,203,67,74,207,177,9,18,19,233,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
