When Isaac BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boss and lifelong friend Joseph Van Dorn is shot and nearly killed leading the high-speed chase of a rum-running vessel, Bell swears to him that he will hunt down the lawbreakers, but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what he is getting into. When a witness to Van DornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shooting is executed in a ruthlessly efficient manner invented by the Russian secret police, it becomes clear that these are no ordinary criminals. Bell is up against a team of Bolshevik assassins and saboteurs - and they are intent on overthrowing the government of the United States. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f92d55afb1bc9878cde7dd78d27c34869045994","amp;dn":"Clive+Cussler+%28Bell+07%29+The+Bootlegger-Chapterized","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f92d55afb1bc9878cde7dd78d27c34869045994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,146,213,90,251,27,201,135,140,222,125,215,141,39,195,72,105,4,89,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
