It is ranked 17th on IMDb's top 250 movies. There's only one other torrent of this in 1080p under 13gigs, but for some reason that encoder chose not to include either of the commentary tracks, which really give insight into what makes this film so great. The first commentary track is by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck, which was recorded exclusively for Criterion in 1988. The second commentary track is &quot;The Scholar's Roundtable&quot; which are scholars and critics David Desser, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Rayns, and Donald Richie discussing Seven Samurai, recorded between 2005 and 2006.\n\nAll three audio tracks are single channel mono because the source was all mono due to the age of the film.\n\nAlso, now that the mp4 container supports soft-coded subtitles, I may not be including .srt subtitle files with my encodes. At this point I'm still considering whether to include external subs. Not every will still need an external .srt subtitle file since subs can now be soft-coded directly into the mp4 container, and for those who do, it only takes about 60 seconds and a visit to subscene.com to get whatever language they need, so .srt files will probably be phased out on future encodes. Feel free to discuss the pros and cons of this in the comments section of this torrent and I'll consider everyone's feedback.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862ba9aaf80a7650f672dd24810907f4dbd4dcbf","amp;dn":"Seven+Samurai+%281954%29+%5B1080p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862ba9aaf80a7650f672dd24810907f4dbd4dcbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,43,169,170,248,10,118,80,246,114,221,36,129,9,7,244,219,212,220,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
