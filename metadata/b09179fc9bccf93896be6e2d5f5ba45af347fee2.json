It was released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV formats. It will be followed by a physical CD release in the UK on 28 March [1] and a special &quot;newspaper&quot; edition on 9 May 2011.[2]\nThe &quot;newspaper&quot; edition will contain two 10-inch vinyl records in a special record sleeve, many large sheets of artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork, a compact disc, and a colour piece of oxo-degradable plastic package.[3] The album will be released by Ticker Tape in the United States, XL in the United Kingdom and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.[4]\nThe album was announced on Radiohead's website on 14 February 2011, four days before release.[5] The release date was originally announced as 19 February, but the band reportedly decided at the last minute to make the album available one day early.[6]\nThe name of the album possibly refers to an oak tree in Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old.[5] The tree is a pollarded oak, referring to an ancient technique for harvesting timber for fencing and firewood. Though it does not feature on maps, the tree is said to be 3 miles (4.8 km) from Tottenham Court House, where Radiohead recorded part of their previous album In Rainbows.[7] On 18 February, Radiohead's official blog published the first song from the album, &quot;Lotus Flower&quot;, with an accompanying music video,[8] followed by a post announcing the album was released.[9]\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\n1.\t&quot;Bloom&quot;  \t5:15\n2.\t&quot;Morning Mr Magpie&quot;  \t4:41\n3.\t&quot;Little by Little&quot;  \t4:27\n4.\t&quot;Feral&quot;  \t3:13\n5.\t&quot;Lotus Flower&quot;  \t5:01\n6.\t&quot;Codex&quot;  \t4:47\n7.\t&quot;Give Up the Ghost&quot;  \t4:50\n8.\t&quot;Separator&quot;  \t5:20\nTotal length:\n37:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b09179fc9bccf93896be6e2d5f5ba45af347fee2","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+The+King+of+Limbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b09179fc9bccf93896be6e2d5f5ba45af347fee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,145,121,252,155,204,249,56,150,190,110,45,95,91,164,90,243,71,254,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
