It is the sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Although it makes no reference to the events in the earlier book, the themes and settings of Through the Looking-Glass make it a kind of mirror image of Wonderland: the first book begins outdoors, in the warm month of May, on Alice's birthday (May 4), uses frequent changes in size as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of playing cards; the second opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on November 4 (the day before Guy Fawkes Night), uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of chess. In it, there are many mirror themes, including opposites, time running backwards, and so on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3714ed6231cad820a74bcd03faf09bdd18289a43","amp;dn":"Lewis+Carroll+-+Through+the+Looking+Glass+%28And+What+Alice+Found+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3714ed6231cad820a74bcd03faf09bdd18289a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,20,237,98,49,202,216,32,167,75,205,3,250,240,155,221,24,40,154,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
