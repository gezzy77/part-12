This lineup recorded Rio's &quot;Tequila&quot; as a B-side to Burgess' &quot;Train to Nowhere.&quot; &quot;Tequila&quot; topped the charts in 1958. The Champs essentially were a one-hit wonder, though they recorded a few more singles in the same Latin dance style and kept going until the mid-'60s. The group's lineup was fluid, and later members included Glen Campbell as well as Jimmy Seals and Dash Crofts, who formed the successful '70s duo Seals and Crofts.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:d9fixqt5ldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:d9fixqt5ldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nNot many other groups got as much mileage out of one song (and, basically, one idea) as the Champs, who played instrumental rock in a Tex-Mex vein into the mid-'60s, long after &quot;Tequila&quot; had been consigned to the oldies bins. This compilation is for diehards only, featuring both sides of 13 singles they cut for Challenge between 1962 and 1965 (one single that was attempted in an MOR pop style is omitted). Glen Campbell, Jim Seals, and Dash Crofts appear on some sides (the liners don't specify exactly which). Most of it's routine Mexican-flavored rock instros, often corny as all hell, including the original version of &quot;Limbo Rock&quot; (which Chubby Checker would take to #2 a few months later in a vocal cover version).\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfqxq8hldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:3cfqxq8hldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is for sale in the UK: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000007XX6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000007XX6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
