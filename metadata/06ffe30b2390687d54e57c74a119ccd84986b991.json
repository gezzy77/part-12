Through his singular combination of lush atmosÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬pheres and thoughtful improvisations, Botti has earned both critical acclaim and mainstream appreciation for a succession of best-selling albums\nChris Botti is a native of Oregon who was born in Portland, raised in Corvallis, and spent two years of his childhood growing up in Italy. His earliest musical influence was his mother, a classically trained pianist and part-time piano teacher. &quot;I can't really sit down and play a song on the piano,&quot; Chris admits. &quot;But I know harmony, and generally I compose on the piano rather than on the trumpet.&quot; He pursued his music studies with a succession of outstanding teachers including Professor Bill Adam and Dave Baker in Indiana, and--following Botti's move to New York City in 1986--the late trumpet master Woody Shaw.\nTorrent includes:\n\n1995 First Wish\n1996 Fourplay\n1997 Midnight Without You\n1999 Playing By Heart\n1999 Slowing Down The World\n2001 Night Sessions\n2002 The Very Best of Chris Botti\n2003 A Thousand Kisses\n2004 When I Fall In Love\n2005 To Love Again\n2006 December\n2006 Live With Orchestra And Special Guests\n2007 Italia\n2009 In Boston [Live]\n2009 In Boston [Live] DVDA\n\nV.A. - Jazz Academy (Michael Brecker, Mike Stern, Peter Erskine, Dave Carpenter, Chris Botti, Luis Conte, Frank Chastenier)\n\nAlbums taken from different websites.
