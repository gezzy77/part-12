It was their fifth studio album \nand the second with the classic Mk II lineup. It was recorded at various times between September 1970 and \nJune 1971. It would become the first of the band's three UK #1 albums, though it didn't stay on the charts \nas long as its predecessor, In Rock.\n\nThe original UK version had &quot;Demon's Eye&quot; as its third track, but did not include &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; \nwhich was instead released as a single there. It was vice-versa on the American and Japanese releases.\n\nThe boogie-inspired &quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; single reached #8 in the UK. This song became a staple of the \nlive set up to the present day, and &quot;Fireball&quot; has also made a few appearances, mainly as an encore. \n&quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot; and &quot;The Mule&quot; appear on the 1972 live album Made in Japan, with the latter morphing \ninto an Ian Paice drum solo.\n\n\n   1.
