Also included is a full colour replica tour poster and a MotÃƒÂ¶rhead button. The cover art features a newly commissioned painting by long time MotÃƒÂ¶rhead artist Joe Petagno.\n\nNineteen tracks made their CD debut on this set, although a number have since been included on MotÃƒÂ¶rhead reissues and most significantly the BBC Live &amp; In-Session set.\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Deaf_Forever!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Deaf_Forever!&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Lemmy (Ian Kilmister) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, lead vocals\n    Larry Wallis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (track 1.2)\n    &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (tracks 1.3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.9)\n    Brian &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (tracks 2.10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.12)\n    Phil &quot;WizzÃƒÂ¶&quot; Campbell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (tracks 2.13Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.16)\n    WÃƒÂ¼rzel (Michael Burston) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (tracks 2.13Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.18)\n    Lucas Fox Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (track 1.2)\n    Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 1.2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.12, 3.1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.7)\n    Pete Gill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 2.13Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.21)\n    Tommy Aldridge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 3.8Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.10)\n    Mikkey Dee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (tracks 3.11Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4.16)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff436e5d5f0b7aafb4d02a96d1e0d59ac56e6bd","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Stone+Deaf+Forever+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff436e5d5f0b7aafb4d02a96d1e0d59ac56e6bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,244,54,229,213,240,183,170,251,77,2,169,109,30,13,89,172,86,230,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
