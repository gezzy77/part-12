I am testing to see if there is an interest in the set od audio books for the Grant Cardone book.....The Closer's Survival Guide./\n\nThis is disk 3 of 8 I will upload the rest if I get interest.\n\nPlease comment.\n\nThanks\n\nThe world is littered with the bodies of sales people who learned enough about selling to make a career of it, but never learned how to close deals consistently in a way to make a success of it.\n\nClosing the sale is the only assurance of rewards. It is not true that you get paid to sell. You are NOT paid to sell. You are only paid to close. Your ability or inability to bring your buyer to a &quot;yes&quot; decision, to quit looking, thinking and stalling and finally close, alone determines your stability and productivity as a sales person. Those that can close love selling and those who cannot close hate it!\n\nWithout this vital step being perfected you can call yourself a salesperson but you will never make it as a successful sales person. All of selling can be reduced to this one thing- Close or Be Closed.\n\nThis book is a compilation of the greatest closes ever assembled in one text. You will be introduced to great, time tested closes that have been around for ages, as well as brand new information for the 21st century. It will prove to be the most powerful information you have ever been given on closing a deal. \n\nIn GrantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new book you will discover why Your Ability &amp; Skills to Close = Your Income!\n\nThis book includes More than 120 Ways to Close the Deal!!\n# DELIVERY CLOSE\n# \tJUSTIFY CLOSE\n# CHECK CLOSE\n# \tLOCK CLOSE\n# SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN CLOSE\n# \tEVERYTHING THE SAME CLOSE\n# PAYMENT CLOSE\n# \tMONEY EQUAL CLOSE\n# PAYMENTS TO FIGURES CLOSE\n# \tCOPY CLOSE\n# RATE CLOSE\n# \tLEAVE ME SOME PAPERWORK CLOSE\n# EQUIPMENT CLOSE\n# \tIMPORTANT PERSON CLOSE\n# TITLE/REGISTRATION CLOSE\n# \tTHIRD PARTY CLOSE\n# PAPERWORK CLOSE\n# \tTREAT YOURSELF CLOSE\n# SPOUSE STALL CLOSE I\n# \tWORK HARD TO EARN THIS CLOSE\n# SPOUSE STALL CLOSE II\n# \tYOU DESERVE IT CLOSE\n# SPOUSE STALL CLOSE III\n# \tDISCOUNT CLOSE\n# SPOUSE STALL CLOSE IV\n# \tSUMMARY CLOSE\n# UNAVAILABLE PARTY CLOSE\n# \tNO EQUITY CLOSE\n# UNAVAILABLE PARTY CLOSE II\n# \tBEN FRANKLIN CLOSE\n# INSURANCE CLOSE\n# \tCOMPARISON INVESTMENT CLOSE\n# SECOND PARTY ASSIST CLOSE\n# \tCOMPARISON CLOSE\n# SECOND BASEMAN CLOSE I\n# \tSAME PRODUCT CLOSE (YOURS)\n# SECOND BASEMAN CLOSE II\n# \tSAME PRODUCT CLOSE (THEIRS)\n# IMMEDIATE DELIVERY CLOSE\n# \tNOW AND LATER CLOSE\n# AGREEMENT CLOSE I\n# \tFLUSH THE OBJECTION CLOSE\n# AGREEMENT CLOSE II\n# \tYOU KNEW THAT BEFORE CLOSE\n# AGREEMENT CLOSE III\n# \tGRATITUDE CLOSE\n# WONÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´T BE THE LAST TIME CLOSE\n# \tTHE UNWIND CLOSE\n# BE GRATEFUL CLOSE\n# \tGOING TO WAIT CLOSE\n# CONGRATULATIONS CLOSE\n# \tWHEN VALUE EXCEEDS PRICE CLOSE\n# DO IT ANYWAY CLOSE\n# \tTHREE AGREEMENTS AND CLOSE\n# DISEASE CLOSE\n# \tMINOR POINT CLOSE\n# DO IT FOR ME CLOSE\n# \tWHO TAUGHT YOU THAT CLOSE\n# INVENTORY CLOSE-MOVE DOWN A MODEL   \n# \tABLE CLOSE\n# INVENTORY CLOSE-MOVE UP A MODEL\n# \tINTELLIGENCE CLOSE\n# SELECTION ALTERNATIVE CLOSE\n# \tDO THE RIGHT THING CLOSE\n# PACKAGE ALTERNATIVE CLOSE\n# \tDO THE RIGHT THING CLOSE II\n# PAYMENT BREAKDOWN CLOSE\n# \tSCARCITY CLOSE\n# BUDGET CLOSE I\n# \tTAKE AWAY CLOSE\n# BUDGET CLOSE II\n# \tFIRST OR LAST CLOSE\n# BUDGET CLOSE III\n# \tSOONER OR LATER CLOSE\n# BUDGET CLOSE IV\n# \tGET IT DONE AND OVER CLOSE\n# BUDGET CLOSE V\n# \tNEVER THE BEST TIME CLOSE\n# ASSUME ZERO BALANCE CLOSE\n# \tWONÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´T ALLOW CLOSE\n# PAYOFF CLOSE\n# \tOWNERSHIP CLOSE\n# DELAY PAYMENT CLOSE\n# \tCONTRIBUTION CLOSE\n# NO COSIGNER CLOSE\n# \tPERSONAL FAVOR CLOSE\n# MOMENTUM CLOSE\n# \tBEG CLOSE\n# NEED TO PRAY ABOUT IT CLOSE\n# \tTHE GAME CLOSE\n# THINK ABOUT IT CLOSE I\n# \tCOMMISSION CLOSE\n# THINK ABOUT IT CLOSE II\n# \tLEAVE IT UP TO THE BANK CLOSE\n# THINK ABOUT IT CLOSE III\n# \tPUPPY DOG CLOSE\n# THINK ABOUT IT CLOSE IV\n# \tFEEL FELT FOUND CLOSE\n# THINK ABOUT IT CLOSE V\n# \tQUALITY CLOSE\n# RE-PRESENT CLOSE [RE-DEMO CLOSE?]\n# \tFUTURE DATE CLOSE\n# APOLOGY CLOSE\n# \tPRICE GUARANTEE CLOSE\n# REFUSE TO BELIEVE CLOSE\n# \tNOW OR NEVER CLOSE\n# CANÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´T QUIT CLOSE\n# \tDONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE CLOSE\n# THREE YESÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´S AND THEN CLOSE\n# \tGET MORE DONE CLOSE\n# REFERRAL CLOSE\n# \tHANDSHAKE CLOSE\n# DOWN TO THE PENNY CLOSE\n# \tADDITIONAL SERVICE CLOSE\n# REDUCE TO RIDICULOUS CLOSE\n# \tPRESSURE CLOSE I\n# BETTER TO LIVE RICH CLOSE\n# \tPRESSURE CLOSE II\n# CANÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´T TAKE IT WITH YOU CLOSE\n# \tPRESSURE CLOSE III\n# NO SHORTAGE OF MONEY CLOSE\n# \tRASH DECISION CLOSE\n# REASON TO BUY CLOSE\n# \tRASH DECISION CLOSE II\n# IF I COULD, WOULD YOU CLOSE\n# \tNOTHING TO DO WITH DECISION CLOSE\n# ELEVENTH INNING CLOSE\n# \tEITHER WAY CLOSE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260ab3afa412ab31933558d35074c8e79651795e","amp;dn":"The+Closers+Survival+Guide+Disk+4+-+22+Basic+Closes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260ab3afa412ab31933558d35074c8e79651795e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,10,179,175,164,18,171,49,147,53,88,211,80,116,200,231,150,81,121,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
