And we\nre not talking about those guys who sell candles and wicker chairs. We re talking &quot;Tier&quot; 1 with a\n&quot;T.&quot; They are the best of the best the elite-est of the elite. To give you an idea of just how elite\nthey are, more than 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines serve in our armed forces. Out of\nthose 2 million, about 50,000 fall under the direct control of Special Operations Command. Although\ntheir exact numbers are classified, only a few hundred out of those 50,000 make the cut as a Tier 1\nOperator. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war. They are experts in the application\nof violence. And out of those few hundred, only one, namely you, will step into the boots of one of\nthese elite warriors in the hostile, unforgiving battlefield conditions in present-day Afghanistan. Do\nyou think you have what it takes to confront a new enemy who improvises mercilessly in a new kind of\nwar? Do you think you have what it takes to be Tier 1? We dare you.\n\nInstall Notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n1. Mount or Burn iso.\n2. Install the game.\n3. Copy over the cracked content.\n4. Play the game!\n5.
