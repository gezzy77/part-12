This concise, code-heavy guide demonstrates how to harness interactive features that HTML5 lacks, including tabs, accordions, and dialog boxes. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to program common but complex tasks, such as managing drag and drop and autocomplete, that make it easier for users to interact with your site.\n\nThis book provides a quick tour of how jQuery UI can improve your HTML pages, followed by standalone chapters that focus on each of the components in detail. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a web developer or designer looking to enrich your website with new featuresÃ¢â‚¬â€without having to dive into full-fledged JavascriptÃ¢â‚¬â€jQuery UI is a must.\n\nThis book covers the following extensions in version 1.8:\n\n    Tab management\n    Accordion menus\n    Dialog boxes\n    Buttons\n    Progress bars\n    Sliders\n    Date pickers\n    Autocompleters\n    Drag and drop management\n    Selection, resizing, and switching of elements\n    New visual effects\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c2560a9daa751cc970cd2027f803b92a8c0ec89","amp;dn":"jQuery.UI+OnlyGill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c2560a9daa751cc970cd2027f803b92a8c0ec89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,37,96,169,218,167,81,204,151,12,210,2,127,128,59,146,168,192,236,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
