I am simply a man in love with nature at its wildest and most beautiful.&quot; In these tales of his adventures across Labrador, Alaska, Siberia, and the Yukon, Vanier's love of the land and the people comes through as clearly and as piercingly exquisite as the photographs that accompany his prose. Traveling on horseback or pony sled, in a fishing boat or by dogsled, Vanier's stories celebrate a land and a life few make the effort to see. They make for dreamy armchair fodder when you're sitting by your fireplace, but may serve as catalysts as well, inspiring you to your own journeys into the rare pleasures of the north. --Stephanie Gold","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e41a4f7ec58482b381501f3144713792a9e3437","amp;dn":"NORTH+-+Adventures+in+the+frozen+wild+%28Travel+Photo+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e41a4f7ec58482b381501f3144713792a9e3437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,65,164,247,236,88,72,43,56,21,1,243,20,71,19,121,42,158,52,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
