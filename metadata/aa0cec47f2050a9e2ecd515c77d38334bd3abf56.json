It is written by Ellis, illustrated by Paul Duffield and published by Avatar Press. The comic's graphic style features richly detailed backdrops and characters.\n\nWarren Ellis announced the project at the 2007 Comic-Con, stating: &quot;I've written two hundred pages and I still have no idea what it's aboutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦it's retro-punk, it's near-future steampunk&quot;[1] It was launched on 2008-02-15. New installments will be released in six full-colour page episodes every week,[2][3] a format intended by \nEllis to give the story the chance to grow naturally.[4]\n\nThe story grew out of wondering what would have happened if the Midwich Cuckoos had survived and grown to disaffected and confused 21 year olds, and the comic builds on the legacy of John Wyndham's style of disaster fiction.[5]\n\nFreakangels is set in a time after London has been flooded. A group, called the Freakangels, live in Whitechapel and their life encounters a dramatic bump when a girl called Alice arrives one day, bearing a shotgun and a grievance against one of their number.[3] Ellis' synopsis of the plot involves characters &quot;living in a post-flood London that they might possibly have had something to do with.&quot;[1]\n\nThe first 24 weekly strips have been collected in a single volume 1 package by Avatar. The volume 2 collection in this torrent includes the strips from weeks 25 - 48. Avatar has stated the intent to publish a collected volume 2 in the near future.\n\nThe strip is currently at week 50. The weekly strip can be found at http://www.freakangels.com\n\nThere were no scanners, but I did collect the weekly strips into a single easy to view .cbr archive file. \n\nThanks to Warren Ellis and Paul Duffield for their continued contributions toward the enrichment of all of our lives.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0cec47f2050a9e2ecd515c77d38334bd3abf56","amp;dn":"Freak+Angels+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0cec47f2050a9e2ecd515c77d38334bd3abf56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,12,236,71,242,5,10,158,46,205,81,92,119,211,131,52,189,58,191,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
