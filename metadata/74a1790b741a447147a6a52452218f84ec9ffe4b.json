Released by Geffen in part because of the delay in the making of Chinese Democracy, the album is subject to lawsuits by band member Axl Rose and former band members in an attempt to block its release due to its track listing. Despite the album having almost no promotion it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number three on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release.\n\nGreatest Hits re-entered the Billboard 200 at number three in March 2012, selling about 85,000 copies as part of a promotion by both Amazon MP3 and Google Play that saw the album sold for 25 cents for one day. The album has proven a popular seller, selling over 5.2 million copies in the United States, as of 2012.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; Appetite for Destruction \t4:32\n2. \t&quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; Appetite for Destruction \t        5:55\n3. \t&quot;Patience&quot; G N' R Lies \t                                5:56\n4. \t&quot;Paradise City&quot; Appetite for Destruction                6:47\n5. \t&quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; Use Your Illusion II \t5:36\n6. \t&quot;Civil War&quot; Use Your Illusion II \t                7:42\n7. \t&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; Use Your Illusion II \t        5:44\n8. \t&quot;Don't Cry&quot; (Original version) Use Your Illusion I \t4:51\n9. \t&quot;November Rain&quot; Use Your Illusion I \t                8:57\n10. \t&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; Use Your Illusion I \t                3:02\n11. \t&quot;Yesterdays&quot; Use Your Illusion II \t                3:18\n12. \t&quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; \t        5:10\n13. \t&quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; \t4:18\n14. \t&quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; Interview with the Vampire \t7:36\n\nTotal length:                                                   79:18\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a1790b741a447147a6a52452218f84ec9ffe4b","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+%282004%29+Greatest+Hits+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a1790b741a447147a6a52452218f84ec9ffe4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,161,121,11,116,26,68,113,71,166,165,36,82,33,143,132,236,159,254,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
