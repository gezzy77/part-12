Pei , Eva PerÃƒÂ³n , Agatha Christie , Muhammad Ali , Bruce Lee , Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare, Cesar Chavez, Pablo Picasso, Maria Montessori, Mother Teresa\n\nIn addition to the biographical reading, each short, easy-tofollow unit includes:\n- Pre-reading questions and activities.\n- Vocabulary exercises -- definition and usage.\n- Main-idea and reading-skills exercises.\n- Questions on detail and inference.\n- Discussion, comprehension, and writing activities.\n- Answers to exercises at the end of each book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362320cd83407431f452f99ac82414fb24a2fa09","amp;dn":"What+a+Life%21+-+Stories+of+Amazing+People+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362320cd83407431f452f99ac82414fb24a2fa09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,35,32,205,131,64,116,49,244,82,249,154,200,36,20,251,36,162,250,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
