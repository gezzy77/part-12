Air Guitar pioneered a kind of plain-talking in cultural criticism, willingly subjective and always candid and direct. A valuable reading tool for art lovers, neophytes, students and teachers alike, Hickey's book - now in its third edition - has galvanized a generation of art lovers, with new takes on Norman Rockwell, Robert Mapplethorpe, Stan Brakhage, Andy Warhol and Perry Mason.\n\nIn June 2009, Newsweek voted &quot;Air Guitar&quot; one of the top 50 books that &quot;open a window on the times we live in, whether they deal directly with the issues of today or simply help us see ourselves in new and surprising ways,&quot; and described the book as &quot;a seamless blend of criticism, personal history, and a deep appreciation for the sheer nuttiness of American life.&quot;\n\nThis is the eBook edition of &quot;Air Guitar&quot;, originally published in print form in August 1997.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be2817ad3364a653237c18c6be65224b53f9fbf9","amp;dn":"Air+Guitar+%28Dave+Hickey%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be2817ad3364a653237c18c6be65224b53f9fbf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,40,23,173,51,100,166,83,35,124,24,198,190,101,34,75,83,249,251,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
