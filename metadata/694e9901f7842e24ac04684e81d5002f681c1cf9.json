You know the number. Now, get ready to experience a classic James Bond mission in a whole new way on PlayStation 3, as GoldenEye 007: Reloaded harnesses the power of PlayStation Move in a cutting-edge espionage thriller.\n\nDaniel Craig, star of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, slips into the tuxedo, letting you experience his unforgettably lethal take on Bond. A Russian super-weapon is orbiting somewhere above the Earth and, using any means necessary, it's up to Bond to recover its activation codes before it can detonate.\n\nPunctuating the action are several nods to 1995's GoldenEye, originally starring Pierce Brosnan as the secret agent, while there are plenty of new locations and missions to make this truly feel like a brand new Bond adventure. There's the familiar, such as the spectacular opening sequence at Arkhangelsk Dam, followed by the new, including a heart-stopping gun battle in a Barcelona nightclub and a hostage rescue at a vast arms show in Dubai.\n\nA modern-day backdrop ensures that Bond's traditional foes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as the old Soviet Union Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are no more. Instead, this threat comes from the shadows, so you must master hi-tech gadgets as well as high-spec firepower to combat it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:694e9901f7842e24ac04684e81d5002f681c1cf9","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+GoldenEye+007%3A+Reloaded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"694e9901f7842e24ac04684e81d5002f681c1cf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,78,153,1,247,132,46,36,172,4,104,78,129,213,0,47,104,28,28,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
