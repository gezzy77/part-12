The canal capitalists made money by investing and speculating in the new inland waterways used to carry fuel and goods around the country. Many of the investors were part of an emerging middle class. The Grand Junction Canal - built to improve the connection between London and the Midlands - was one of the new routes, and eventually proved to be a good investment for shareholders. However, not all canals were profitable. The new investors discovered that investment capitalism was a system that created winners and losers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3073 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 657 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0689qmh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90c747d253c78843718943f1add8447519be228","amp;dn":"Canals.The.Making.Of.A.Nation.3of6.Capitalism.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90c747d253c78843718943f1add8447519be228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,12,116,125,37,60,120,132,55,24,148,63,26,221,132,71,81,155,226,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
