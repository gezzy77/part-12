Then I downloaded an existing Minecraft for Linux torrent and resolved the &quot;black screen&quot; issue myself downloading the latest &quot;lwjgl-2.9.0&quot; libraries and installing into &quot;.minecraft&quot; folder.\n\nThe maximum update possible (that is upto ver1.5.2) is already done in this. The so called &quot;horse update&quot; is available from Mojang website but I have not yet tried it.\n\nThe instructions are in the HOW_TO.txt file in the ZIP. Follow the simple instructions and enjoy.\n\nPLEASE SEED!! :D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c447d22a1e7ddd6249a6f6ae94b3761d8e40d792","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.5.2+for+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c447d22a1e7ddd6249a6f6ae94b3761d8e40d792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,71,210,42,30,125,221,98,73,166,246,174,148,179,118,29,142,64,215,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
