How else to explain the dreams he keeps having - dreams that mirror, with impossible accuracy, the gruesome serial murders taking place all over San Francisco? How else to explain the feelings these dreams provoke in him - not disgust, not horror, but excitement? As Bryan and his longtime partner, Lawrence 'Pookie' Chang, investigate the murders, they learn that things are even stranger than they at first seem.\n\nPersonal Note:\n\nI discovered Scott Sigler on the Joe Rogan podcast. He is a young up and coming author. This is one of his earlier works. His Infected trilogy is terrific as well. If you like his work please support him and follow him on Twitter. He also performs and releases audiobooks in the form of free podcasts on his website.\n\nEnjoy!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0284346e2b9e61d38d5fec2eab350b6260a4891","amp;dn":"Nocturnal+%28Unabridged%29+by+Scott+Sigler+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0284346e2b9e61d38d5fec2eab350b6260a4891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,40,67,70,226,185,230,29,56,213,254,194,234,179,80,182,38,10,72,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
