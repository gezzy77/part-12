These parks are rich in plant and animal species, thriving in their indigenous natural environment and beauty.\nEach country has its own national parks which protect a number of species. Till 1 970, India had only five national parks. However, new laws were passed in the 1 970s and 1 980s to protect wildlife and the environment. As a result, many more national parks were established.\nBy 201 2, there were 1 03 national parks in India. This number will definitely increase, as plans are afoot to set up a total of 1 66 national parks. This issue of Tell Me Why unfolds for you a stunning panorama of the Wonders of Wild India.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f589a90e1c10a232c0c1d22225ed4a51a12ca8","amp;dn":"India%27s+National+Parks+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2380%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f589a90e1c10a232c0c1d22225ed4a51a12ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,245,137,169,14,28,16,162,50,192,193,210,34,37,237,74,81,161,44,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
