The selection of specific works of art, and the essays that illuminate them, give a clear focus to the period from the fourteenth through the first half of the sixteenth century. This was a transitional and pivotal time for Nuremberg in its evolution from an important but artistically self-contained Late Gothic town to a Renaissance city, whose artistic, humanistic, technological, and scientific endeavors were of far-reaching consequence. The production of works of artÃ¢â‚¬â€including some of the highest moments of human achievementÃ¢â‚¬â€paralleled the city's strengthening commercial position. The benevolent yet firm hand of a patrician government produced a stable environment, while members of the great families became the leading patrons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:355871ddf96bf967025c53fa048ae787ae00624d","amp;dn":"Gothic+and+Renaissance+Art+in+Nuremberg+1300+-+1550+%28Art+Ebook%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"355871ddf96bf967025c53fa048ae787ae00624d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,88,113,221,249,107,249,103,2,92,83,250,4,138,231,135,174,0,98,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
