This reference integrates a historical perspective of materials engineering principles with biological interactions of biomaterials. Also provided within are regulatory and ethical issues in addition to future directions of the field, and a state-of-the-art update of medical and biotechnological applications.\n\nAll aspects of biomaterials science are thoroughly addressed, from tissue engineering to cochlear prostheses and drug delivery systems. Over 80 contributors from academia, government and industry detail the principles of cell biology, immunology, and pathology. Focus within pertains to the clinical uses of biomaterials as components in implants, devices, and artificial organs. This reference also touches upon their uses in biotechnology as well as the characterization of the physical, chemical, biochemical and surface properties of these materials.\n\n* Provides comprehensive coverage of principles and applications of all classes of biomaterials\n* Integrates concepts of biomaterials science and biological interactions with clinical science and societal issues including law, regulation, and ethics\n* Discusses successes and failures of biomaterials applications in clinical medicine and the future directions of the field\n* Cover the broad spectrum of biomaterial compositions including polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, carbons, natural materials, and composites\n* Endorsed by the Society for Biomaterials\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface\nIntroduction: Biomaterials Science: A Multidisciplinary Endeavor\n\nPart 1: Materials Science and Engineering\nChapter 1: Properties of Materials\nChapter 2: Classes of Materials Used in Medicine\n\nPart 2: Biology, Biochemistry, and Medicine\nChapter 3: Some Background Concepts\nChapter 4: Host Reactions to Biomaterials and Their Evaluation\nChapter 5: Biological Testing of Biomaterials\nChapter 6: Degradation of Materials in the Biological Environment \nChapter 7: Application of Materials in Medicine, Biology, and Artificial Organs \nChapter 8: Tissue \n\nPart 3: Practical Aspects of Biomaterials\nChapter 9: Implants, Devices, and Biomaterials: Issues Unique to this Field \nChapter 10: New Products and Standards\nChapter 11: Perspectives and Possibilities in Biomaterials Science \n\nAppendix A: Properties of Biological Fluids \nAppendix B: Properties of Soft Materials\nAppendix C: Chemical Compositions of Metals Used for Implants\nAppendix D: The Biomaterials Literature\nIndex\n\n\nNOTE: I have also included the 1st Ed in this torrent.
