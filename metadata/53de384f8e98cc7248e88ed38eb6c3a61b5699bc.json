No need for no-CD patches, as other releases required. Thanks to the cracker, this issue is now history.)\n- Released by: LoveWarez.\n- Uploaded by: LoveWarez.\n\n\nWelcome to another VREAL QUALITY RELEASE.\n\nQuality releases are tested and viruscanned to ensure you optimal experience! This is not free... It costs a big and nice THANKS!\nWell, not really, but it is appreciated. (Also, remember to SEED!)\n\nWarcract II is a classic RTS game - even though it&amp;#039;s old, it&amp;#039;s still very amusing! Especially if you have memories from old times, back when you played this game.\n\n---------------------\n\nHere are instructions. Be sure to follow them 100% in order for it to work properly:\n\n1. \nYou&amp;#039;ll need DOSBox in order for this to work (Not included) - HOWEVER you can run this off Windows XP (is tested), but it will lagg (both picture and sound) nomatter how fast your computer is. So DOSbox is highly recommended.\nDOSBox is required to work with Vista. \n\nDownload the latest release of DosBox here:\nwww.dosbox.com \n\n2.\nIf you don&amp;#039;t like consoles, then download a nice DOSBox GUI from here:\n\n3.\nHowever, if you don&amp;#039;t like to configure all this, VREAL has released an already modified and installed version of DOSBox with the D.O.G included which will run out of the box. (For optimal user-friendlyness, yes, Vreal is your best source.).\nBut of course, in a couple of years (it&amp;#039;s 2008 today) the DOSBox version will be outdated. Therefore, it&amp;#039;s recommended to download a fresh install and configure it yourself. \nIf you want the Vreal Version - Search for: &quot;DOSbox.GUI.Modified.and.ready2use.VREALQRELEASE&quot; on the same torrentsite you found this one and extract it to your installationfolder.\n\n4. \nNow, unrar the whole .RAR file to anywhere you want - it doesn&amp;#039;t need any installation.\n\n5. \nRun the file: &quot;war2.exe&quot; through DOSBox or the D.O.G GUI. \n\n6. \nENJOY! AND SEED! \n\n---------------------\n\nThere is no fire like greed, \nNo crime like hatred, \nNo sorrow like separation, \nNo sickness like hunger of heart, \nAnd no joy like the joy of freedom. \n\nHealth, contentment and trust \nAre your greatest possessions, \nAnd freedom your greatest joy. \n\nLook within. Be still. \nFree from fear and attachment, \nKnow the sweet joy of living in the way. \n\n- from the Dhammapada, Words of the Buddha ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53de384f8e98cc7248e88ed38eb6c3a61b5699bc","amp;dn":"Warcraft.II.2.FULL.DOSgame-VREALQRELEASE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53de384f8e98cc7248e88ed38eb6c3a61b5699bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,222,56,79,142,152,204,114,72,232,142,211,142,182,195,166,27,86,153,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
