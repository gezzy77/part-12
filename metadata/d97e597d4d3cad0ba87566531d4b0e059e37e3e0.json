(Still-motion videos consist of photos that are shown for the fraction of a second - though not to be confused with stop motion where photos necessarily correlate with each other and create the 'illusion' of animation).\n\nBriefly lets you create these videos with just a few clicks. Import your photos (from your hard drive, flickr or Instagram) and a soundtrack and Briefly does the rest for you. You can then share your videos with friends and family right from within Briefly on Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and flickr. When you can't decide which photos to show, why not just show them all - with Briefly.\n\n\nWhat's New: \nVersion 1.5.2:\n\n-Fixed a few minor bugs for OS X Yosemite\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n-Intel, 64-bit processor\n-OS X 10.7.5 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97e597d4d3cad0ba87566531d4b0e059e37e3e0","amp;dn":"Briefly+1.5.2+MacOSX+Cracked-CORE+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97e597d4d3cad0ba87566531d4b0e059e37e3e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,126,89,125,77,60,173,11,168,117,102,83,29,75,14,5,158,55,227,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
