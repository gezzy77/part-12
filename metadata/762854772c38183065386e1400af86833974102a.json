One of the most popular music stars in America, Faith Hill celebrates the joy-and faith- of the season with 'Joy to the World.' \n\nAllmusic Review:\nFaith Hill's holiday album Joy to the World is a proudly old-fashioned record -- almost too much so, really, as there is nothing surprising about it, from its collection of shopworn standards to the full-blown yet curiously stiff production. Basically, this is an album where if you read the title, you will know how the song will sound: &quot;Joy to the World&quot; gets a big, bombastic, orchestral arrangement appropriate for a concert recital, &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; swings like Sinatra conducted by Billy May, &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; is prim and proper, &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; feels pulled from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; is sweet and stately. Everything is business as usual, right down to Hill's performances: big, not blustery; they're immaculate theater, sometimes verging on grandstanding but often suited for the occasion. Which might not make Joy to the World a singular holiday album in any respect -- it's too pat and perfect to be memorable -- but for anybody looking for a new old-fashioned Christmas album, this suits the bill just fine. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762854772c38183065386e1400af86833974102a","amp;dn":"Faith+Hill+-+Joy+to+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762854772c38183065386e1400af86833974102a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,40,84,119,44,56,24,48,101,56,110,20,0,175,134,131,57,116,16,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
