At the Battle of Leuktra, his Thebans crushed the fearsome army of Sparta that had enslaved its neighbors for two centuries.\n\nWe follow these epic historical events through the eyes of MÃƒÂªlon, a farmer who has left his fields to serve with Epaminondas-swept up, against his better judgment, in the fever to spread democracy even as he yearns to return to his pastoral hillside.\n\nWith a scholar's depth of knowledge and a novelist's vivid imagination, Hanson re-creates the ancient world down to its intimate details-from the weight of a spear in a soldier's hand to the peculiar camaraderie of a slave and master who go into battle side by side. The End of Sparta is a stirring drama and a rich, absorbing reading experience.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d1485d4f21e010db6ad8fcf220ec2fc62c7aff","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Sparta+by+Victor+Davis+Hanson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9d1485d4f21e010db6ad8fcf220ec2fc62c7aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,209,72,93,79,33,224,16,219,106,216,252,242,32,236,47,198,44,122,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
