From 1969 to 1975 he developed his own unique style and is the best period of his music.A mixture of hard funk, psycadelic rock, avante-garde electronic jazz, that never been equaled. &quot;Get It up With It&quot;, an album of such wilderness and lack of commercial forethoughts makes it rare and unique.\nDownload and enyoy this marvelous music and share it.\nmuzik62\n\n----- Tracks ---------\n1.
