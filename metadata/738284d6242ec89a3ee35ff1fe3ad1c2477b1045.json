His Dub Me Crazy albums helped dub make the transition into the digital age, when electronic productions started to take over mainstream reggae in the '80s. His space-age tracks not only made use of new digital technology, but often expanded dub's sonic blueprint, adding more elements and layers of sound than his forebears typically did. In the mid-'90s, he returned to the basics, debuting a more retro-sounding style on the Black Liberation Dub series. Additionally, he ran his own studio and label, Ariwa, which was home to a stable of vocalists (with an emphasis on lovers rock and conscious roots reggae) and some of the finest British reggae productions of the era. As his reputation grew, he became a remixer of choice for adventurous rock and techno acts, most notably revamping Massive Attack's entire second album under the new title No Protection. \n\n\nLee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry--\n\nSome call him a genius, others claim he's certifiably insane, a madman. Truth is, he's both, but more importantly, Lee Perry is a towering figure in reggae -- a producer, mixer, and songwriter who, along with King Tubby, helped shape the sound of dub and made reggae music such a powerful part of the pop music world. Along with producing some of the most influential acts (Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers and the Congos to name but two) in reggae history, Perry's approach to production and dub mixing was breathtakingly innovative and audacious -- no one else sounds like him -- and while many claim that King Tubby invented dub, there are just as many who would argue that no one experimented with it or took it further than did Lee Perry. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae/Dub\nLabel:\t\t\tAriwa\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Cheerful Dub\n02.Drummer Boy Dub\n03.Bounce Back Dub\n04.Dub Voodoo\n05.Shadow Of Dub\n06.Mystic Powers Of Dub\n07.Arkwell Dub\n08.Mr. Dubfire\n09.Dub Connection\n10.Messy Dub Apartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n            ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:738284d6242ec89a3ee35ff1fe3ad1c2477b1045","amp;dn":"Dub+Take+The+Voodoo+Out+Of+Reggae+%281997%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"738284d6242ec89a3ee35ff1fe3ad1c2477b1045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,130,132,214,36,46,200,154,62,227,95,241,254,58,209,194,71,123,16,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
