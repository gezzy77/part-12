With 2016's Evolution, Smith returns to Blue Note, his first studio album for the label since 1970's Drives. Produced by Don Was, Evolution is one of the most robust albums of his career. Where his previous few albums found him working in a trio format, on Evolution, Was surrounds Smith with various small group configurations featuring a bevy of post-bop, funk, and soul-ready musicians including drummers Jonathan Blake and Joe Dyson, guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg, trumpeters Keyon Harrold and Maurice Brown, and others. Also joining Smith here are several jazz luminaries including genre-bending pianist Robert Glasper, whose glassy piano tone rubs nicely against Smith's burnished Hammond warmth on &quot;Play It Back.&quot; Similarly, saxophonist Joe Lovano, who first made his debut on Smith's 1975 effort Afrodesia, joins in on several cuts, including a reworking of &quot;Afrodesia&quot; and the slow-jam ballad &quot;For Heaven's Sake.&quot; While Smith is the star of Evolution, the expanding group sound works well with his expansive approach to funk-jazz and the cuts with Harrold and Brown bring to mind the energetic hip-hop-inflected jazz of the Roots. Ultimately, it's Smith's juicy, nuanced, Hammond B-3 sound, deepened by over 50 years of experience, that makes Evolution such a career pinnacle.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview by Steve Greenlee\r\nDr. Lonnie Smith, one of the godfathers of the jazz organ, returns to the record label that cemented his status as a B-3 king in the 1960s. Now, 45 years after his previous session for Blue Note, Smith has issued not only what might be his own greatest album but one of the finest contributions to the jazz-organ canon.\r\n\r\nEvolution is a tour de force consisting of seven mostly long tracks in decidedly different styles. This is an album that showcases the many sides of organ-based jazz. â€œPlay It Back,â€ a 14-minute clinic in greasy â€™70s funk, reads like an amped-up homage to Jimmy Smith. The first keys are played not by Smith but by crossover pianist Robert Glasper, informing us immediately that this is not your grandpaâ€™s organ-jazz record, though the main riff is straight-up â€œRoot Down.â€ If the rhythms of Evolution seem particularly infectious, thatâ€™s because there are two drummers, Johnathan Blake and Joe Dyson, delivering them on four of the seven tunes. Thatâ€™s partly what makes the reworking of Smithâ€™s â€œAfrodesiaâ€â€”featuring saxophonist Joe Lovano, whose debut arrived on Smithâ€™s 1975 album of the same nameâ€”so banging.\r\n\r\nTextures constantly move. Lovano shows up again on â€œFor Heavenâ€™s Sake,â€ which despite its smooth-jazz proclivities is the most romantic slice of organ jazz youâ€™ve heard in years. A traditional organ trio, with guitar and drums, tackles Thelonious Monkâ€™s â€œStraight, No Chaser,â€ and here Smith offers a long, juicy solo that pulls no punches and serves no gimmicks. â€œTalk About Thisâ€ is more modern, with grooving beats, funky horns and J.B.â€™s-type chants. An unconventional treatment of â€œMy Favorite Thingsâ€â€”with a super-long, super-quiet introâ€”takes its sweet time (11 minutes) developing, and Smith ends with a 10-minute version of his African Suite that emphasizes African rhythms and John Ellisâ€™ superb flute playing. Just when you think youâ€™ve heard everything that organ jazz has to offer, Dr. Lonnie Smith evolves.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecbef67b26efcede7fb9a76e6e1c69aa1f08b61","amp;dn":"Dr.+Lonnie+Smith+-+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ecbef67b26efcede7fb9a76e6e1c69aa1f08b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,203,239,103,178,110,252,237,231,251,154,118,230,225,198,154,161,240,139,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
