Who-or what-is responsible for the thousands of complex patterns found in cereal crops all over the world? Are they made by aliens or Government satellites? Are they screams from a dying planet? Are we in danger, and are crop circles some kind of warning signal? Colin Andrews, author of the first book about the crop circle phenomenon, brings the world up to date with his many years of research into this fascinating subject. He takes you on a mysterious and informative ride into the world of the crop circle phenomenon, providing an overview and setting the record straight about the nature of crop circles, their origin, and their meaning. He and Stephen J. Spignesi, explore the many theories of crop circle formation, describe Colin's first experience with crop circles and how this led him into his life's work.
