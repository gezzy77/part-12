In this article, and supporting the ground-breaking work of Arthur and Marilouise Kroker,\n\nI shall evaluate the contribution of Virilio&amp;#039;s writings by suggesting that they exist beyond the terms of postmodernism and that they should be conceived of\n\nas a contribution to the emerging debate over &amp;#039;hypermodernism&amp;#039;. Consequently, the article details Virilio&amp;#039;s biography and the theoretical context of his work\n\nbefore outlining the essential contributions Virilio has made to contemporary cultural theory. In later sections an appraisal of Virilio&amp;#039;s hypermodernism,\n\ntogether with a short evaluation of the controversies surrounding Virilio&amp;#039;s work, will be provided before the conclusion.\n\n\n\nA challenging survey of the technologies of perception, production and dissemination of images throughout history by one of FranceÃƒÂ­s leading contemporary intellectuals, Paul Virilio.\n\n\n\nSurveying art history as well as the technologies of war and urban planning, Virilio provides us with an introduction to a new ÃƒÂ«logistisc of the imageÃƒÂ­.\n\n\n\nFrom the era of painting, engraving and architecture culminating in the 18th century,\n\nthe history of ÃƒÂ«regimes of the visualÃƒÂ­ shifted with the intervention of the photogram(photography and cinematography) in the 19th century.\n\nThe latest era starts with videography, holography and infographics, turning the dissolution of modernity into a generalized logic of public representations.\n\n\n\nVirilioÃƒÂ­s book offers the most provocative account of the history of ÃƒÂ«seeingÃƒÂ­ to date and could revolutionise the way we periodise not only art history but ÃƒÂ«social existenceÃƒÂ­ itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32bd737e5de795b00d4ad827a3970b84598f9f5","amp;dn":"Paul+Virilio+-+The+Vision+Machine+%281994%29+-+ART+book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32bd737e5de795b00d4ad827a3970b84598f9f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,43,215,55,229,222,121,91,0,212,173,130,122,57,112,184,69,152,249,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
