In his one-day creativeLIVE workshop, Eyal Levi of Audiohammer Studios will show you how to get the most out of the industry-leading digital solution for creating real-sounding drums. Eyal, a seasoned producer, engineer, and musician, will teach you everything you need to know to get the most out of EZDrummer. From writing and arranging realistic drum parts to how to mix the output in your DAW, Eyal will show you how to be the sole arbiter of your sound -- no drummer required. This workshop is taught with Protools -- but includes a QuickStart guide so Logic, Cubase, and Ableton users can follow along.
