Think and Grow Rich for Women is simply a book that needed to be written for today's woman to help her ...\nLechter, coauthor of the best-selling Rich Dad, Poor Dad (2007), revisits Napoleon HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1937 self-help book from the perspective of modern women, who stand to inherit nearly $30 trillion in global wealth. Mindful that advice on wealth accumulation can be much the same for men and women, Lechter argues that the difference in womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values calls for a different perspective. But she takes issue with the notion that women need to seek a balance between home life and career, instead counseling women to replace guilt with power to make choices to create Ã¢â‚¬Å“one big life filled with love, family, satisfaction, success, and significance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She begins each chapter with a contemporary review of HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, then offers lessons on how women have applied his philosophy, drawing on interviews with successful women, from the founder of Mary Kay cosmetics to Condoleezza Rice to Sandra Day OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor. Following HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s example, she offers a sisterhood MasterMind compendium of inspirational quotes from women and ends each chapter with prompts for formulating an action plan to further career goals. --Vanessa Bush \n\n\nReview\n\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sharon Lechter has taken the best of Napoleon Hill to inspire women of all ages to Think and Grow Rich.
