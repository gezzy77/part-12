Early reviews say it all: &quot;Far and away the best Hawke yet!&quot; A resurgent, militaristic China has built a secret fleet, a wolf pack of the most stunningly powerful weapons delivery systems since the invention of undersea naval warfare. How did China leapfrog our technology so brilliantly...and so quickly? Hawke faces his most difficult challenge ever as he and his soldiers of fortune embark for China and North Korea on a do or die mission with zero margin for failure. \n    They are on a desperate search for a man who disappeared without a trace from the streets of Georgetown four years earlier. A man, Hawke believes, who holds the key to the balance of military power in the Pacific...and the world. His mission takes him from the incredibly lavish retreats of the Chinese Communist Party elites and deep inside the insane world of North Korean death camps, far more horrific than even the barbaric Nazi camps of World War II. One man has the world on his shoulders once more. And this time, the weight may be too much for even Lord Alexander Hawke to bear. \n\nBook Description (by the author: \n\n&quot;WARRIORS&quot; - published on APRIL 1ST, 2014.
