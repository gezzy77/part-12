The group hails from Norway and consists of ethereal vocalist Anneli Marian Drecker, plus Nils Johansen and Geir Jenssen. The group claims to draw its inspiration from powerful energy fields, including those of the female and the earth&amp;#039;s gravitational pull; additionally, their compositions sometimes draw on world music and the ambient experiments of Brian Eno. Bel Canto released its first album, White-Out Conditions, in 1987. After 1989&amp;#039;s Birds of Passage, they recorded 1992&amp;#039;s Shimmering, Warm and Bright and 1996&amp;#039;s Magic Box.\n\n7. Albums:\n\n1. White-Out Conditions, 1987\n2.
