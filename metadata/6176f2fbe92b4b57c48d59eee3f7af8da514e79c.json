The Earth was saved from the Ultimate threat Ã¢â‚¬â€ Gah Lak Tus. But scientist George Tarleton has captured a piece of that awesome entity and plans to reactivate it for his own evil purposes. The only hope for mankind against this mad scheme Ã¢â‚¬â€ the strange alien being called The Vision!\n\nUltimate Vision #2\nThe Gah Lak Tus module, an object of immense cosmic power, is now in the murderous hands of George TarletonÃ¢â‚¬â€leader of the sinister organization A.I.M. And with the otherworldly Vision down, nothing stands in the way of total conquest of Earth by this alien force.\n\nUltimate Vision #3\nDespite the efforts of the alien Vision, the unimaginably powerful Gah Lak Tus module draws into its core the energies of the A.I.M. orbital research station and then makes landfall on Earth. And this lone instrument may accomplish what countless of its robotic brethren could notÃ¢â‚¬â€the utter destruction of our helpless planet. \n\nUltimate Vision #4\nThe Gah Lak Tus module has landed on Earth! And nothing in manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arsenal can even give it pause! The other-worldly Vision is our last hope, but she was designed for communication purposes, not lethal combat.

A fitting finale to one of the finer limited series of the year.\n\n*All credit goes to the scanners*\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
