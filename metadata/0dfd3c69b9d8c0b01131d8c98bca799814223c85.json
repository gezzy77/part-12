Gloria Swanson stalks through the proceedings as an opera prima donna who goes through men like tissue paper. While on holiday in Venice with her elderly fiance Ferdinand Gottschalk, Swanson becomes intrigued by one of her admirers, Melvyn Douglas (in his film debut). One evening Douglas manages to corner the heroine in her lavish apartment, whereupon she becomes convinced that he's merely a gigolo interested in her money. But -- ha-ha -- the last laugh is on Swanson when Douglas reveals that he's a representative of the Metropolitan Opera, determined to sign her to a contract. Produced by Sam Goldwyn, Tonight or Never represented the end of the first phase of Gloria Swanson's talkie career; she subsequently announced her &quot;retirement&quot; but was back before the cameras two years later. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022489/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022489/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Swanson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Swanson&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSpan subs:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3115480/tonight-or-never-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3115480/tonight-or-never-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nMervyn LeRoy\n\n\n        Gloria Swanson\t ... \tNella Vago\n\n\tMelvyn Douglas\t... \tJim Fletcher\n\tAlison Skipworth\t... \tMarchesa Bianca San Giovanni\n\tFerdinand Gottschalk\t... \tRudig\n\tRobert Greig\t... \tConrad\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:18:02\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x400\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1359 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,26 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 122 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dfd3c69b9d8c0b01131d8c98bca799814223c85","amp;dn":"Tonight+or+Never+%281931%29++Gloria+Swanson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dfd3c69b9d8c0b01131d8c98bca799814223c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,253,60,105,185,216,192,176,17,49,216,201,139,202,121,152,20,34,60,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
