Here is Titanic 1997...\n\nHave fun and seed...\n___________________________________\n\nIn 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore the wreck of RMS Titanic, searching for a diamond necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. They recover Caledon &quot;Cal&quot; Hockley's safe, believing the necklace to be inside, but instead find a sketch of a nude woman wearing it, dated April 14, 1912, the night the Titanic hit the iceberg. An elderly woman named Rose Dawson Calvert, hearing about the drawing, calls Lovett and claims that she is the woman depicted and she and her granddaughter, Lizzy Calvert, visit him and his team on his salvage ship. Asked if she knows the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose recalls her time aboard the Titanic, revealing that she is Rose DeWitt Bukater, a passenger believed to have died in the sinking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:601559fee8ae643da5a9baec114545c9839837f5","amp;dn":"Titanic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"601559fee8ae643da5a9baec114545c9839837f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,21,89,254,232,174,100,61,165,169,186,236,17,69,69,201,131,152,55,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
