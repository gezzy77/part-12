As usual, Batman tries to rid Gotham\nCity of evil, but he's not doing it alone. Assisting the Caped Crusader are retired\nMI-6 operative Alfred Pennyworth, who also serves as the superhero's butler, and\nlethal swordswoman Tatsu &quot;Katana&quot; Yamashiro. Among the villains who lead Gotham\nCity's criminal underworld that Batman and his crew battle are Anarky, Professor\nPyg, Mister Toad and Magpie.\n\nProduced by DC Entertainment, Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network.\n\n\nWhen Bruce Wayne is &quot;assassinated&quot; by Batman, he lets the world\nthink he's dead and goes in search of the imposter - the Bad Batman.\n\nBeware.the.Batman.S01E24.Epitaph.WEBCap.XviD.MP3.avi\n\nVideo: Xvid 624x352 25.000fps [Qf 0.18]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo [128Kbps VBR]\nDuration: 00:20:54\nFile size: 167 MB\n\n\n* Episode 25 &quot;Twist&quot; is unavailable.
