Help arrives in the form of a grieving gay neighbor, a visiting monarch, and the dashing young lieutenant who defects from her yacht. Bittersweet and profoundly affecting, Babycakes was the first work of fiction to acknowledge the arrival of AIDS.\n\nSIGNIFICANT OTHERS - Narrated by Cynthia Nixon\n\nTranquility reigns in the ancient redwood forest until a women-only music festival sets up camp downriver from an all-male retreat for the ruling class. Among those entangled in the ensuing mayhem are a lovesick nurseryman, a panic-stricken philanderer, and the world's most beautiful fat woman. Significant Others is Armistead Maupin's cunningly observed meditation on marriage, friendship, and sexual nostalgia.\n\nSURE OF YOU - Narrated by Eric McCormack\n\nA fiercely ambitious TV talk show host finds she must choose between national stardom in New York and a husband and child in San Francisco. Caught in the middle is their longtime friend, a gay man whose own future is even more uncertain. Wistful and compassionate, yet subversively funny, Sure of You could only come from Armistead Maupin.\n\nMy rips. 64kbps mono.\n\nShare and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8086dbb8b0830412cd11ea46938f0e7285e5ee6","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+City+Omnibus%3A+Vol+2+-+Armistead+Maupin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8086dbb8b0830412cd11ea46938f0e7285e5ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,8,109,187,139,8,48,65,44,209,30,164,105,56,240,231,40,94,94,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
