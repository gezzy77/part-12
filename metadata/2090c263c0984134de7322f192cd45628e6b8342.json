The band was initially formed in the Fall of 2006 by drummer Jonathan Schang, keyboardist Rob Clearfield, bassist Patrick Mulcahy and guitarist Sam Krahn. The foursome from Chicago soon began creating a captivating blend of Progressive Rock, Metal, Classical and Jazz reminiscent of Planet X and other no-holds barred Instrumental Rock groups. They honed their skills for a year before deciding the right vocalist was needed to complement their sound.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2090c263c0984134de7322f192cd45628e6b8342","amp;dn":"District+97+-+Hybrid+Child+%282010%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2090c263c0984134de7322f192cd45628e6b8342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,144,194,99,192,152,65,52,222,115,34,241,146,205,69,98,142,107,131,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
