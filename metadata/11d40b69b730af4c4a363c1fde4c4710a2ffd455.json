It follows the days of JosÃƒÂ© Saramago, the Nobel-laureate Portuguese novelist, and his wife, Pilar del Rio. The film shows their whirlwind life of international travel, his passion for completing his masterpiece, &quot;The Elephant's Journey&quot; and how their love quietly sustains them throughout. &quot;Jose and Pilar&quot; reveals the hidden Saramago, unravels any preconceived notions about him, and proves that genius and simplicity are indeed compatible. It is a funny and touching portrait on the endurance of the artistic spirit. A glimpse into the life of one of the greatest creators of the 20th century, it shows us that, as Saramago says, &quot;There is always another way to say everything.&quot;\n\n\nAvi format + PT- SUBS.\n\n\nInside the rar there is a repeated set of PT-SUBS, not sure why. This is legit, anyhow. Other subtitles may be available elsewhere on the internet.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed ;).\n\n\n\n\n*I did not create this torrent and take no credit for ripping or creating the content.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d40b69b730af4c4a363c1fde4c4710a2ffd455","amp;dn":"Jose+e+Pilar.XviD.%282010%29-%5BDVDRip.%5D.+%28%2B+PT-SUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d40b69b730af4c4a363c1fde4c4710a2ffd455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,212,11,105,183,48,175,76,74,54,60,31,222,76,71,16,162,255,212,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
