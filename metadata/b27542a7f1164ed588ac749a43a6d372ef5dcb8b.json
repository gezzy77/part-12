They distributed anti-Nazi leaflets, printed subversive newspapers, hid resisters, secreted Jews to safety, transported weapons, and conveyed clandestine messages. The youngest was a schoolgirl of sixteen, who scrawled &quot;V&quot; (for victory) on the walls of her lycÃƒÂ©e; the eldest, a farmer's wife in her sixties who harbored escaped Allied airmen. Strangers to one another, hailing from villages and cities across FranceÃ¢â‚¬â€230 brave women united in defiance of their Nazi occupiersÃ¢â‚¬â€they were eventually hunted down by the Gestapo. Separated from home and loved ones, imprisoned in a fort outside Paris, they found solace and strength in their deep affection and camaraderie.\n\nIn January 1943, they were sent to their final destination: Auschwitz. Only forty-nine would return to France.\n\nDrawing on interviews with these women and their families, and on documents in German, French, and Polish archives, A Train in Winter is a remarkable account of the extraordinary courage of ordinary peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€a story of bravery, survival, and the enduring power of female friendship.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nIn an unfocused account, Moorehead relates the story of 230 women accused of being members of the French Resistance who were sent on one train to Auschwitz in January 1943; fewer than 50 survived the war. In fact, only some of the 230 were involved in actual Resistance activities. The youngest prisoner, 16-year-old Rosa Floch, caught writing &quot;Vive les Anglais!&quot; on her school's walls, died of typhus in Birkenau. Alsatian psychiatrist Adelaide Hautval was arrested after exhorting German soldiers to stop mistreating a Jewish family; she survived the war, but committed suicide after recording the horrors she saw when forced to participate in Josef Mengele's medical experiments at Auschwitz. Moorehead (Human Cargo) wants to recount how these women supported one another and to honor women of the Resistance, but she tries to tell too many stories about a highly diverse group of women, many of them not Resistance members. Though moving, the lack of focus may leave readers confused.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27542a7f1164ed588ac749a43a6d372ef5dcb8b","amp;dn":"Caroline+Moorehead+-+A+Train+in+Winter+%5B96%5D+Unabr+%5BWWII+History%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27542a7f1164ed588ac749a43a6d372ef5dcb8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,117,66,167,241,22,78,213,136,172,116,154,67,166,211,114,239,93,203,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
