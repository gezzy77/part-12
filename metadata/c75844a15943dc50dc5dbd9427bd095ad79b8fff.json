Enthralled by your story idea, you write tons of material. Your word count grows in leaps and bounds. But the deeper you get into your screenplay or novel, the more difficult writing it becomes. \r\n\r\nThe words no longer flow freely; they trickle out. \r\n\r\nPanicked, you stare at your computer screen, wondering, What happens next? \r\n\r\nYou have no idea. \r\n\r\nYouâ€™ve run out of steam. \r\n\r\nYouâ€™re stuck. \r\n\r\nYou end up with a half-finished draft. Thousands of words that go nowhere. \r\n\r\nAfter a few cycles of this, you may question whether youâ€™re even cut out for this writing gig, after all. \r\n\r\nDonâ€™t lose faith! \r\n\r\nThe problem isnâ€™t with you. Itâ€™s with your method. \r\n\r\nHereâ€™s one solution: outline your screenplay or novel before writing it. \r\n\r\nWith such an outline in hand, you wonâ€™t get stranded. Youâ€™ll know where your story is headed; you wonâ€™t have to decide where to take it. \r\n\r\nYou can navigate blank pages without panicking. \r\n\r\nWith this writing skills guide, youâ€™ll learn how to quickly produce such an outline. A 3-part process, it looks like this: \r\n\r\nMake Sure Your Story Idea Isnâ€™t a Time-Sink\r\n\r\nWhen you get a seemingly great story idea, you probably like to â€œrun with it.â€ \r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the thing: not all ideas are worth the time it takes to outline them, let alone write a first draft based on them. \r\n\r\nNo matter whether youâ€™re a â€œplotterâ€ or a â€œpantser,â€ you should develop your story idea first, so it has the 6 components all compelling stories share. \r\n\r\nThis way, you can maximize its potential, making sure it has enough substance to sustain a full-length film or novelâ€”and enough appeal to attract an audience to read (or watch) it. \r\n\r\nBuild Your Story Structure\r\n\r\nEven a great idea can collapse if it doesnâ€™t have solid structure to support it. \r\n\r\nBasically, when well executed, story structure ensures your screenplay or novel becomes progressively more interesting as it goes along. \r\n\r\nIn addition, because youâ€™ve figured out structural signposts in advance, you wonâ€™t be traversing â€œin the dark,â€ for very long. \r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll always have a bearing to head toward, a destination just around the corner. Hence, youâ€™re unlikely to become so discouraged that you abandon your project altogether. \r\n\r\nBut if you want to boost your confidence and enhance your efficiency, then youâ€™ll want toâ€” \r\n\r\nOutline Your Story with a Method Backed by Scientific Research (Sort Of)\r\n\r\nHere, youâ€™ll learn about a radical new outlining method that will help you plot out your entire story in as little as 2 hours. \r\n\r\nIt incorporates a simple technique Stanford researchers have concluded can make you 60% more creative (on average). \r\n\r\nA Sampling of What You Will Accomplish with This Step-By-Step Writing Guide\r\n\r\nyour protagonistâ€™s goal will have the attributes necessary to prevent audience attention from drifting away\r\nyouâ€™ll make your story idea more ironic, and hence, more commercial\r\nusing a simple template, youâ€™ll produce a one-sentence summary of your story (which will help you write and market it)\r\nyouâ€™ll figure out your first-act break and inciting incident in 10 minutes (probably less)\r\nyouâ€™ll crack the middle of your story (including the midpoint and the end of Act Two), so that writing it will be less of a stress-fest\r\nyou will have a list of all the plot points in your story, ultimately enabling you to write a better story, faster (no fancy software required)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c75844a15943dc50dc5dbd9427bd095ad79b8fff","amp;dn":"Sizzling+Story+Outlines+-+H.+R.+D%27Costa.epub%09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c75844a15943dc50dc5dbd9427bd095ad79b8fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,88,68,161,89,67,220,80,220,93,189,148,39,189,9,90,215,155,143,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
