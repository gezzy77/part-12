The choice of material is very wide-ranging, delving from standards by Billy Strayhorn and Dizzy Gillespie to Wayne Shorter's post-bop works and Latin jazz.  \n \nThis is an excellent outing that belongs in every Stan Getz fan's collection, a supremely satisfying spread of straight-ahead jazz.\n\n\n\nStan Getz\n\nStanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Party\n\n1977\n\n\n\n  2CDs / 1996 / VBR-V0\n\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\n1.
