Like fellow chillwavers, he sings wistfully over a blend of acoustic instruments and electronic programming, and uses a retro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s palette of synth sounds. After the Be So True EP and Sunndreamm EP generated a buzz online in 2010, Diaz announced that his first full-length, Replicants, would become available in early 2011.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Obelisk\n02.Cosmonaut\n03.Easy Now\n04.On &amp; On\n05.Replicants\n06.Tokyo 3\n07.001\n08.Forerunner\n09.Perfect Eyes\n10.Calrissian\n11.Sentimental\n12.Gravity Feels\n13.Synanthropic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fdadce260535a95e14e3ed64643724ffa50174e","amp;dn":"MillionYoung+-+Replicants+%282011%29+mp3%40CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fdadce260535a95e14e3ed64643724ffa50174e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,218,220,226,96,83,90,149,225,78,62,214,70,67,114,79,250,80,23,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
