As if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not bad enough, she also has to outwit her seven overprotective older brothers, avoid the politics involved with being the only daughter born to an ancient vampire dynasty, and elude Kieran Black-agent of an anti-vampire league who is searching for his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killer and is intent on staking Solange and her entire family.Luckily she has her own secret weapon-her human best friend Lucy-who is willing to defend SolangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to a normal life, whether sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being smothered by her well-intentioned brothers or abducted by a power-hungry queen. \n\n02 Blood Feud by Alyxandra Harvey \nIt's been centuries since Isabeau St. Croix barely survived the French Revolution. Now she's made her way back to the living and she must face the ultimate test by confronting the evil British lord who left her for dead the day she turned into a vampire. That's if she can control her affection for Logan Drake, a vampire whose bite is as sweet as the revenge she seeks. The clans are gathering for Helena's royal coronation as the next vampire queen, and new alliances are beginning to form now that the old rifts of Lady Natasha's reign have started to heal. But with a new common enemy, Leander Montmarte-a vicious leader who hopes to force Solange to marry him and usurp the power of the throne for himself-the clans must stand together to preserve the peace he threatens to destroy.\n\n03 Out for Blood by Alyxandra Harvey \nHunter Wild just wants to get through her last year at the secret Helios-Ra Academy.

The Hel-Blar donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on targeting LucyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocent cousin Christabel by mistake.Ã£â‚¬â‚¬ And Christabel didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on finding such drama in a sleepy town like Violet HillÃ¢â‚¬â€or being rescued by a vampire as tempting as Connor Drake.\n\n05 Blood Moon by Alyxandra Harvey \nWhen the vampire tribes convene for the rare Blood Moon ceremonies, Solange's fight with her feral nature, a mysterious stranger, family secrets and forbidden magic put all of the Drakes in danger.
