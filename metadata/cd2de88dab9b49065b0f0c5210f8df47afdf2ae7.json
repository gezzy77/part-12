The album was the first released by Petty after signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records (where he had recorded as part of the Traveling Wilburys) and the first of three albums produced by Rick Rubin. The album features all members of the Heartbreakers with the exception of drummer Stan Lynch, who left (or got fired by) the band earlier in 1994.\n\n\n Under the guidance of producer Rick Rubin, Tom Petty turns in a stripped-down, subtle record with Wildflowers. Coming after two albums of Jeff Lynne-directed bombast, the very sound of the record is refreshing; Petty sounds relaxed and confident. Most of the songs are small gems, but a few are a little too laid-back, almost reaching the point of carelessness. Nevertheless, the finest songs here (&quot;Wildflowers,&quot; &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; &quot;It's Good to Be King,&quot; and several others) match the quality of his best material, making Wildflowers one of Petty's most distinctive and best albums.
