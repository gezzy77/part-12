Shortly after arriving, he is hustled by homeless con man Ratzo Rizzo, who had said he would manage him for a $20 fee. Bent on getting his money back, Buck finds the rapidly deteriorating Rizzo, ends up feeling sorry for him, and moving into Rizzo's room in an abandoned building to care for him. The two remain hopeful of striking it rich with Rizzo managing Buck's career, but it soon becomes obvious that they are no match for the urban jungle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88584eaf8fde2b225de1f8e8f0d23defdbb1950c","amp;dn":"Midnight+Cowboy+1969+DVDrip+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88584eaf8fde2b225de1f8e8f0d23defdbb1950c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,88,78,175,143,222,43,34,93,225,248,232,240,210,61,239,219,177,149,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
