Like kindred souls, the two connected instantly, leading to a euphoric romance. The catch: He's married.  As one promise after another was broken, the storybook love affair began to unravel. Wrought with confusion, Micalle set out to discover how she could have allowed passion to overrule logic and wondered about the likelihood of their situation resulting in happily-ever-after.  The other woman, Micalle discovered, walks into an affair blind and leaves wishing she were. Worse, there is hardly a book on the shelf to comfort her, awaken her, or better yet; stop her from making a disaster of her life.  Finding little material to glean from, Micalle began asking her own questions. What she found was that her experience wasn't entirely unique. This epitome led to several years of research into the triangle of affairs and who the other woman really is.  Being the Other Woman was written to illuminate her path.  In sometimes humorous but often painful detail, Micalle gives the raw story of her own affair, countless interviews from women who became mistresses, and research into the psychology of the other woman and the man who cheats.  What is really going on in the mind of the mistress? Her lover? His wife? Being the Other Woman will help the reader identify in what type of affair the other woman is involved and provide guidance as to whether or not the husband will really leave his wife, how to make smart relationship decisions, and how to heal from the tremendous pain one is bound to experience either  by being the other woman or having one in your life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:358ad2d89a7652b64b958c418f9c9bf28bef38ef","amp;dn":"Being+The+Other+Woman+-+Micalle+A+Culver+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"358ad2d89a7652b64b958c418f9c9bf28bef38ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,138,210,216,154,118,82,182,75,149,140,65,143,156,155,242,139,239,56,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
