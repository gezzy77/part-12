Jimmy Page is playing some of the best guitar \r\nI have ever heard, and despite his back problems during this show, \r\nJonesy is amazing on bass and keyboards. Robert's voice is in very \r\ngood shape, and the only problem comes from Bonham. He sounds fine \r\nsometimes, but other times, his fills are measures behind the rest \r\nof the group and his playing is erratic ... it still sounds fine with \r\nthe songs and makes for some new arrangements, but sometimes he seems \r\nlost ... they drop Moby Dick because of this. (&quot;He's got trouble with \r\nhis back. He's been lying in bed all day. It's about time we had some \r\nsordid press. It should be noted that he doesn't just play backgammon!&quot; \r\nPlant stated somewhere in the show.) Anyhow, this show is great, and \r\nNo Quarter, Ten Years Gone and Achilles Last Stand rock! Jimmy is on; \r\nthis is his show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf12c3b6993b0e986dbb61a5c6c841918ebb745","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.06.19+San+Diego%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf12c3b6993b0e986dbb61a5c6c841918ebb745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,241,44,59,105,147,176,233,134,219,182,26,92,108,132,25,24,235,183,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
