The 4th (and so far latest) tour only CD. It was originally only sold on his 2006 tour, but was later made available on Travis Dickerson&amp;#039;s record label TDRSmusic, until it eventually went out of print.\n\nThe demand for the album was still very high, and eventually Travis Dickerson decided to attempt a re-pressing of the disc. However, as future projects took up a lot of time, fans were asked to pre-order the re-pressing of Crime Slunk Scene, with no set date for when the album would be released. When the pre-orders got to a certain amount, the re-pressing of the album was OK&amp;#039;d.\n\nDickerson has also stated that there could be future reissues of other Buckethead discs using this same process.\n\n\n\n[edit] Track listing\nKing James - 3:57 \nGory Head Stump 2006: The Pageant of the Slunks - 5:31 \nThe Fairy and the Devil - 2:57 \nBuddy Berkman&amp;#039;s Ballad - 3:40 \nMad Monster Party - 3:24 \nSoothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie) - 9:04 \nCol.
