Before I put them in a library somewhere, you might like the results of this project too..... Enjoy\n\nPS: You might say 400 tracks! (even twice) that is much too much. I agree, however, I am the one to decide whether a song has been included. From 1800 to 800 (in a high valued collection) is a big step and - being as objective as possible - I can not go any further without excluding tracks that simply should not be excluded. So five Dutch Treat playlists (15 tracks each) and twice 400 tracks (Dark and Light) it is.\n\n\nDutch Treat - A9 Rare Hits Dark (New Wave)\n\n 1000 Mexicans - Diving For Pearls (Version)\n 1000 Ohm - Love In Motion\n 1000 Ohm - You Lose\n 4 Out Of 5 Doctors - Anna With Antennae\n 4 Out Of 5 Doctors - Modern Man\n 4-4-1 - In The Night\n A Popular History Of Signs - Western Wind\n A.S.
