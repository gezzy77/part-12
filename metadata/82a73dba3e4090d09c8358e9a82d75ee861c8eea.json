Most of these additional bonus tracks have never been released. A special iTunes Digital Edition will have everything from the Digital Edition, plus a further set of additional bonus tracks. A Double Vinyl Deluxe Edition will also be available and will feature the original album, and its own set of exclusive songs.\n\nThe band will release a special &quot;Slang Video Collection&quot; the same day (February 11) exclusively on iTunes that will feature videos from singles &quot;Slang&quot;, &quot;Work It Out&quot; and &quot;All I've Ever Wanted&quot;.\n\n&quot;Slang&quot; was first released in May 1996 and is considered the band's most underrated album. At the time of its release, the music industry was at the height of the '90s grunge scene and DEF LEPPARD with bands like NIRVANA, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS and PEARL JAM were dominating the airwaves. Despite this musical shift, &quot;Slang&quot; charted on the Top Five U.K. official chart and the Top 15 in the U.S. on The Billboard 200 chart. The album was also voted in the Top Ten Albums Of 1996 by the U.K.'s prestigious Q magazine.\n\nAs a testament to DEF LEPPARD's music transcending through time, &quot;Slang&quot; was recognized for its musical departure from the band's signature sound. The collection incorporated new sonic elements that gave the album a slightly darker introspective mood than their previous releases. As guitarist Phil Collen stated in an interview with Metal Hammer: &quot;We've all got personal things that have happened during the recording of 'Slang', and we've just ploughed on and some of it has come out on the record.&quot;\n\nDef Leppard released Ã¢â‚¬Å“SlangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1996 at a time when rock was definitely out of fashion thanks to the popularity of new styles such as Grunge. As a result of this the album sold well but nowhere near as well as the previous two albums had done, being the first Def Leppard album to fail to achieve platinum status in the US. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radically different sound may have also put fans off at the time, but now the album is being reissued as a Deluxe Edition along with a whole load of bonus material.\n\nSo what do you get for your money? Well for a start you get the album itself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11 tracks . Then you get another five tracks on the disc. On the second disc you get another 14 tracks of which almost all are alternative versions of tracks from the album Ã¢â‚¬â€œ demoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, rough mixes and early versions. So instead of just the original 11 track album you get 30 tracks with this version.\n\nThe album itself has a much harder rock feel to it. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got rid of the highly produced sound from the previous albums and instead thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a more natural feel to it, more reflective of a live performance than their earlier studio work. I must admit that this album passed me by when it was first issued, and coming after Ã¢â‚¬Å“HysteriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“AdrenalizeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ I can see it would have been a shock to the fans, but listening to it now I do like the heavier raw sound that the band have used on this album, and anyone who isnt a fan of the polished commercially successful sound from their big hits is likely to find this a much better album.\n\nThe huge amount of bonus material makes this a great puchase for Def Leppard fans and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely interesting listening to some of the rough mixes or early drafts of the songs to hear how they changed, and also to hear some of the other songs that werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t on the album.\n\nThis is a great album and one that was overlooked by many at the time of its original release, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great to see it being given a re-release and to see so much bonus material included. Well worth a listen even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t consider yourself a Def Leppard fan.\n\n- T R A C K L I S T -\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01. Truth (3:01)\n02. Turn To Dust (4:21)\n03. Slang (2:37)\n04.
