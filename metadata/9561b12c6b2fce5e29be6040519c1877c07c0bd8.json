Unlike most artists who bend themselves to fit the standards of the season, Brown didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t abandon his carefully crafted style for Christmas: he made records that sounded like his hits, they just happened to be about Santa Claus and Christmastime. And his three holiday LPs were not interchangeable, either. Each reflected the sound of the year, so Christmas Songs was steeped in dramatic, string-laden uptown soul; A Soulful Christmas dug deep into the grooves, going so far as to include Ã¢â‚¬Å“Say It Loud - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Black and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m ProudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the thick of the proceedings; and Hey America was powered by deep, heavy funk. Because so much emphasis is on the grooves, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long for the Christmas themes to become incidental, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine; these three albums were recorded while James Brown &amp; the JBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were at a peak so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pleasure just to hear them play anything. This may be a disappointment for some looking for more JB that is as clearly Christmas as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the entirety of The Complete James Brown Christmas is a joy that could be shared at any time of the year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9561b12c6b2fce5e29be6040519c1877c07c0bd8","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+The+Complete+James+Brown+Christmas+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9561b12c6b2fce5e29be6040519c1877c07c0bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,97,177,44,107,47,206,94,41,190,96,64,81,156,24,119,192,124,11,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
