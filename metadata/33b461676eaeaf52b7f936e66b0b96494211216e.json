Dr. \nStrangelove's jet-black satire (from a script by director Stanley Kubrick, \nPeter George, and Terry Southern) and a host of superb comic performances \n(including three from Peter Sellers) have kept the film fresh and \nentertaining, even as its issues have become (slightly) less timely. \nLoaded with thermonuclear weapons, a U.S. bomber piloted by Maj. T.J. King \nKong (Slim Pickens) is on a routine flight pattern near the Soviet Union \nwhen they receive orders to commence Wing Attack Plan R, best summarized \nby Maj. Kong as Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies! On the \nground at Burpleson Air Force Base, Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Peter \nSellers) notices nothing on the news about America being at war. Gen. \nJack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) calmly informs him that he gave the \ncommand to attack the Soviet Union because it was high time someone did \nsomething about fluoridation, which is sapping Americans' bodily fluids \n(and apparently has something to do with Ripper's sexual dysfunction). \nMeanwhile, President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) meets with his top \nPentagon advisors, including super-hawk Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. \nScott), who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism \nin general and Russians in particular. However, the ante is upped \nconsiderably when Soviet ambassador de Sadesky (Peter Bull) informs \nMuffley and his staff of the latest innovation in Soviet weapons \ntechnology: a Doomsday Machine that will destroy the entire world \nif the Russians are attacked.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Peter Sellers.\n=&gt;-George C Scott.\n=&gt;-Sterling Hayden.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Stanley Kubrick.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : War : Classic.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1964.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.56 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 356 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1.34 GiB.\n=&gt;-Dr Strangelove.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr_strangelove/\n=&gt;-Dr Strangelove.............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-dr-strangelove-1964/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 1080.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2222 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 183 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b461676eaeaf52b7f936e66b0b96494211216e","amp;dn":"Strippers+vs+Werewolves+-+Horror+Comedy+2012+Eng+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b461676eaeaf52b7f936e66b0b96494211216e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,180,97,103,110,174,175,82,183,249,54,230,107,11,150,73,66,17,33,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
