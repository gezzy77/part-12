The book is titled 'Geostatistics with Applications in Earth Sciences&quot;. This new edition has been completely revised to reflect the notable concept - and technique-wise in geostatistics. Chapter 1 has been expanded and incorporates more detials on sampling and sampling designs. Chapters 2 and 5 have been extensively revised and a new chapter &quot;Introduction to Advanced Geostatistics&quot; has been added. Also new are the &quot;Review Questions&quot; at the end of each chapter and the computer codes on the CD-Rom.\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\nPreface to the First Edition\nTable of Contents\nSome Important Symbols Used in the Text\n1 Statistical Methods In Earth Sciences\n1.1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1.1 Sampling, Data Collection and Sample Design\n1.1.2 Sample Design and the Various Steps\n1.1.3 Criteria for SelectinglDrawing a Sample\n1.1.4 Characteristics of a Good Sample Design\n1.1.5 Different Types of Sample Design\n1.1.6 Analysis Aspects\n1.2 HYPOTHESIS\n1.3 QUANTIFICATION AND PREDICTION IN EARTH SCIENCES\n1.4 THE CONCEPT OF RANDOM VARIABLE\n1.5 PROBABILITY\n1.6 FREQUENCY FUNCTION, JOINT FREQUENCY FUNCTION, CONTINUOUS FREQUENCY FUNCTION AND JOINT CONTINUOUS FREQUENCY FUNCTION\nReview Questions\n2 Univariate Statistical Methods, Frequency Analysis and Simulation\n2.1 UNIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS\n2.2 FREQUENCY ANALYSIS\n2.3 GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF FREQUENCYDISTRIBUTION\n2.4 ARITHMETIC REPRESENTATION OF EMPIRICAL DISTRIBUTIONS\n2.4.1 Measure of Central Location\n2.4.2 Measures of Dispersion\n2.4.3 Skewness and Kurtosis\n2.5 CORRELATION AND REGRESSION\n2.5.1 Correlation Coefficient\n2.5.2 Regression\n(a) Linear\n(b) Multiple Linear Regression\n(c) Polynomial Regression\n(d) Other Regression Functions\n2.6 SIMULATION\n2.6.1 Introduction\n2.6.2 Advantages of Simulation\n2.6.3 Limitations of Simulation Techniques\n2.6.4 Generation of Random Numbers\n2.6.5 Monte-Carlo Simulation\n2.7 SOME APPLICATIONS OF SIMULATION\n2.7.1 Applications to Inventory Control\n2.7.2 Applications to Gold Mineralisation\nReview Questions\n3 Some Statistical Distributions\n3.1 THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION\n3.1.1 Salient Features of Normal Distribution and Normal Probability Law\n3.1.2 Confidence Limits for the Mean (z)\n3.2 THE LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION AND PROPERTIES\n3.2.1 Estimates for the Mean\n3.2.2 Confidence Limits for the Mean\n3.3 THE CHI-SQUARE (X2) TEST\n3.4 APPLICATIONS\n3.4.1 Bauxite Example: Distribution of Fe203 Element\n3.4.2 Gold Ore Distribution\n3.4.3 Copper Example\n3.5 CASE OF REJECTION OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION\nReview Questions\n4 Stochastic Modelling (Time Series Analysis) and Forecasting\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\n4.1.1 Stochastic Processes\n4.1.2 The Autocorrelation Function (acf)\n4.2 STOCHASTIC MODELLING (TIME SERIES ANALYSIS)\n4.2.1 Physical Significance in Relation to Estimation of Blocks of Ore\n4.2.2 Estimation of Parameters of A.R Process of Order p [AR(p)]\n4.2.3 Moving Average Process [MA(q)]\n4.2.4 Auto-regressive and Moving Average Process of Order p, q [ARMA(p, q)]\n4.3 APPLICATIONS\n4.3.1 Bauxite Example (Fe203)\n4.3.2 Gold Mineralisation\n4.3.3 Copper Example\n4.4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS (FREQUENCY DOMAIN)\n4.4.1 Spectrum, Discrete Fourier Transform (OFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nA.
