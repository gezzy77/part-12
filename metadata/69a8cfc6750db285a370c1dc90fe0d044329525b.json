This book simplifies the subject and demonstrates with practical examples that risk is perfectly straightforward and not as complicated as it might seem. Unlike most books written on portfolio risk, which generally focus on ex-ante risk from an academic perspective using complicated language and no worked examples, this book focuses on ex-post risk from a buy side, asset management, risk practitioners perspective, including a number of practical worked examples for risk measures and their interpretation.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface xv\n\nAcknowledgements xvii\n\n1 Introduction 1\n\nDefinition of risk 1\n\nRisk types 1\n\nRisk management v risk control 4\n\nRisk aversion 4\n\nEx-post and ex-ante 4\n\nDispersion 5\n\n2 Descriptive Statistics 7\n\nMean (or arithmetic mean) 7\n\nAnnualised return 8\n\nContinuously compounded returns (or log returns) 8\n\nWinsorised mean 9\n\nMean absolute deviation (or mean deviation) 9\n\nVariance 10\n\nMean difference (absolute mean difference or Gini mean difference) 12\n\nRelative mean difference 14\n\nBesselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s correction (population or sample, n or nÃ¢Ë†â€™1) 14\n\nSample variance 17\n\nStandard deviation (variability or volatility) 17\n\nAnnualised risk (or time aggregation) 18\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem 19\n\nJanssen annualisation 19\n\nFrequency and number of data points 19\n\nNormal (or Gaussian) distribution 21\n\nHistograms 22\n\nSkewness (FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s or moment skewness) 22\n\nSample skewness 24\n\nKurtosis (PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kurtosis) 24\n\nExcess kurtosis (or FisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kurtosis) 25\n\nSample kurtosis 25\n\nBera-Jarque statistic (or Jarque-Bera) 27\n\nCovariance 28\n\nSample covariance 30\n\nCorrelation (Ãï¿½) 30\n\nSample correlation 32\n\nUp capture indicator 32\n\nDown capture indicator 34\n\nUp number ratio 34\n\nDown number ratio 34\n\nUp percentage ratio 35\n\nDown percentage ratio 35\n\nPercentage gain ratio 35\n\nHurst index (or Hurst exponent) 35\n\nBias ratio 37\n\n3 Simple Risk Measures 43\n\nPerformance appraisal 43\n\nSharpe ratio (reward to variability, Sharpe index) 43\n\nRoy ratio 46\n\nRisk free rate 46\n\nAlternative Sharpe ratio 47\n\nRevised Sharpe ratio 48\n\nAdjusted Sharpe ratio 48\n\nSkewness-kurtosis ratio 49\n\nMAD ratio 49\n\nGini ratio 52\n\nRelative risk 53\n\nTracking error (or tracking risk, relative risk, active risk) 53\n\nRelative skewness 54\n\nRelative kurtosis 55\n\nInformation ratio 55\n\nGeometric information ratio 56\n\nModified information ratio 57\n\nAdjusted information ratio 61\n\nRelative Hurst 61\n\n4 Regression Analysis 69\n\nRegression equation 69\n\nRegression alpha (ÃŽÂ±R) 70\n\nRegression beta (ÃŽÂ²R) 70\n\nRegression epsilon (ÃŽÂµR) 70\n\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 71\n\nBeta (ÃŽÂ²) (systematic risk or volatility) 71\n\nJensenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alpha (JensenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s measure or JensenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s differential return or ex-post alpha) 72\n\nAnnualised alpha 72\n\nBull beta (ÃŽÂ² +) 73\n\nBear beta (ÃŽÂ² Ã¢Ë†â€™) 73\n\nBeta timing ratio 73\n\nMarket timing 78\n\nSystematic risk 81\n\nR2 (or coefficient of determination) 83\n\nSpecific or residual risk 83\n\nTreynor ratio (reward to volatility) 84\n\nModified Treynor ratio 86\n\nAppraisal ratio (or Treynor-Black ratio) 86\n\nModified Jensen 87\n\nFama decomposition 88\n\nSelectivity 88\n\nDiversification 88\n\nNet selectivity 89\n\nFama-French three factor model 89\n\nThree factor alpha (or Fama-French alpha) 91\n\nCarhart four factor model 91\n\nFour factor alpha (or CarhartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alpha) 91\n\nK ratio 91\n\n5 Drawdown 97\n\nDrawdown 97\n\nAverage drawdown 97\n\nMaximum drawdown (or peak to valley drawdown) 98\n\nLargest individual drawdown 98\n\nRecovery time (or drawdown duration) 98\n\nDrawdown deviation 98\n\nUlcer index 99\n\nPain index 100\n\nCalmar ratio (or drawdown ratio) 100\n\nMAR ratio 100\n\nSterling ratio 100\n\nSterling-Calmar ratio 101\n\nBurke ratio 102\n\nModified Burke ratio 102\n\nMartin ratio (or Ulcer performance index) 102\n\nPain ratio 103\n\nLake ratio 103\n\nPeak ratio 106\n\n6 Partial Moments 107\n\nDownside risk (or semi-standard deviation) 107\n\nPure downside risk 108\n\nHalf variance (or semi-variance) 108\n\nUpside risk (or upside uncertainty) 108\n\nMean absolute moment 109\n\nOmega ratio (\u0006) 110\n\nBernardo and Ledoit (or gain-loss) ratio 110\n\nd ratio 110\n\nOmega-Sharpe ratio 111\n\nSortino ratio 112\n\nReward to half-variance 112\n\nDownside risk Sharpe ratio 113\n\nDownside information ratio 113\n\nKappa (Kl) (or Sortino-Satchell ratio) 113\n\nUpside potential ratio 114\n\nVolatility skewness 114\n\nVariability skewness 115\n\nFarinelli-Tibiletti ratio 115\n\nProspect ratio 117\n\n7 Extreme Risk 119\n\nExtreme events 119\n\nExtreme value theory 119\n\nValue at risk (VaR) 119\n\nRelative VaR 120\n\nEx-post VaR 120\n\nPotential upside (gain at risk) 121\n\nPercentile rank 121\n\nVaR calculation methodology 122\n\nParametric VaR 124\n\nModified VaR 125\n\nHistorical simulation (or non-parametric) 125\n\nMonte Carlo simulation 126\n\nWhich methodology for calculating VaR should be used?
