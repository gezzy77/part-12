His backup group from the early 1960s, The Hawks, evolved into The Band.  His two most sought after albums have never been issued on CD, until now. What makes these albums so special is the guitarist on both albums is Duane Allman.  Ronnie Hawkins was originally issued on the Cotillion label in 1970. Along with Duane Allman, it also features King Biscuit Boy and Eddie Hinton.  The Hawk was originally issued on the Cotillion label in 1971. Besides Duane Allman, it also features Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn on bass and The Memphis Horns.\n\n\n\nRonnie Hawkins - Vocals \n \nThe Dixie Flyers: \nJim Dickinson - Piano, Acoustic Guitar \nMike Utley - Organ \nCharlie Freeman - Electric &amp; Acoustic Guitars \nSammy Creason - Drums \n \nWith: \nDuane Allman - Electric Guitar, Dobro \nDonald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn - Bass \nThe Memphis Horns on tracks 2 &amp; 5\n \n  \nAccording to Jimmy Johnson, in the 1960's studio guitarist\nand sound engineer for Rick Hall's FAME Studio in Muscle Shoals, AL.\nand in 1969 co-founder of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section\nand Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, Duane Allman plays on:\n\ntrack 1: Duane plays dobro\ntrack 2: Duane plays lead guitar\ntrack 4: Duane plays lead guitar\ntrack 5: Duane plays lead guitar\ntrack 6: Duane plays lead guitar\ntrack 9: Duane plays dobro\ntrack 10: Duane plays dobro\ntrack 12: Duane plays electric guitar \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256b945ba542a95b725b19ba97f3d6d45cfa8608","amp;dn":"Ronnie+Hawkins...The+Hawk%281971%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256b945ba542a95b725b19ba97f3d6d45cfa8608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,107,148,91,165,66,169,91,114,91,25,186,151,243,214,212,92,250,134,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
