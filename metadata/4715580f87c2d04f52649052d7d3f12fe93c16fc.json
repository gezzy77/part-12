They corner him and gun him down in a sewer tunnel, where he falls into a pool of chemicals dumped by the company who created it, Dutech. The combination of feces and this chemical transforms him into a half human, half feces creature, who goes on a killing rampage. And it's up to a group of local law enforcers to stop him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4715580f87c2d04f52649052d7d3f12fe93c16fc","amp;dn":"Monsturd.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4715580f87c2d04f52649052d7d3f12fe93c16fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,21,88,15,135,194,208,79,82,100,144,82,215,211,241,47,233,60,22,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
