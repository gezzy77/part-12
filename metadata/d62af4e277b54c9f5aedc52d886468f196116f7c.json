The series lasted for 12 issues from 1999 to 2001 and led to several spin-off; see below. The story is about the day-to-day lives and work of the police officers of Neopolis, a city that is home to all the super-powered beings -- everyone has super powers and is wearing colorful costumes in Neopolis -- and that is protected by the 10th Police Precinct and the Top 10 team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62af4e277b54c9f5aedc52d886468f196116f7c","amp;dn":"Alan+Moore%3A+Top+Ten+%28America%27s+Best+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62af4e277b54c9f5aedc52d886468f196116f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,42,244,226,119,181,76,159,90,237,197,45,136,100,104,241,150,17,111,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
