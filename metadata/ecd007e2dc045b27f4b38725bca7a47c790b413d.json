These 10 patterns to knit were created by Lisa Gentry, and they use a wide variety of yarns ranging from light weight to super bulky weight. Besides being warm and attractive, cowls are a practical choice. They are seamed or knit into one continuous piece, or buttoned together for wearing. So while a scarf or muffler has loose ends that must be rewrapped or retied--once you put on a cowl, it stays put beautifully! Designs include Garter Ridge Cowl, Shoulder Fringed Cowl, Buttoned Lace Cowl, Squiggles and a Flower Cowl, Button as You Please Cowl, Tempting Texture Cowl, Rose Neck Wrap Cowl, Diamonds with a Twist Cowl, Lace with a Twist Cowl, and Sideways Made Cowl.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd007e2dc045b27f4b38725bca7a47c790b413d","amp;dn":"Knit+Cowls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd007e2dc045b27f4b38725bca7a47c790b413d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,208,7,226,220,4,91,39,244,179,135,37,188,167,164,124,121,11,65,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
