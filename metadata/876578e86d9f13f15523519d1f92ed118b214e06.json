This lineup recorded Rio's &quot;Tequila&quot; as a B-side to Burgess' &quot;Train to Nowhere.&quot; &quot;Tequila&quot; topped the charts in 1958. The Champs essentially were a one-hit wonder, though they recorded a few more singles in the same Latin dance style and kept going until the mid-'60s. The group's lineup was fluid, and later members included Glen Campbell as well as Jimmy Seals and Dash Crofts, who formed the successful '70s duo Seals and Crofts. \n\n[IMG]http://img429.imageshack.us/img429/2103/lp7ci.jpg[/IMG]\n\nThe Champs / Go, Champs, Go! - Everybody's Rockin'\nTrack Title  \n1.
