His son, Nelson, is behaving erratically; his daughter-in-law, Pru, is sending out mixed signals; and his wife, Janice, decides in mid-life to become a working girl. As, though the winter, spring, and summer of 1989, Reagan's debt-ridden, AIDS-plagued America yields to that of George Bush, Rabbit explores the bleak terrain of late middle age, looking for reasons to live.\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Audiofile:\n\nFew novels are more suited to the listening experience than those of the late John Updike, whose gifts as a storyteller were unsurpassed. Arthur Morey narrates the fourth and final volume of Updike's novels about Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom with an almost-incantatory style that perfectly suits the large canvas of its settingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½America in 1989. Morey's nuanced reading makes Rabbit realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½vulnerable yet hopeful. The story fixes a time in our history through the eyes of a flawed but memorable character whose indulgences mimic the &quot;Me Decade.&quot; His glory as a high school basketball star gone, his carnal appetite reduced by heart disease, his business brought to chaos, and his relationships diminished by time, Rabbit Angstrom comes to an end in Florida, the country's geriatric purgatory.\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nUpdike's most famous work is his Rabbit series. Both Rabbit Is Rich and Rabbit At Rest received the Pulitzer Prize. He published more than twenty novels and more than a dozen short story collections, as well as poetry, art criticism, literary criticism and children's books. Hundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in The New Yorker, starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for The New York Review of Books.\nHis novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal. He died in January 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3fbbf0380518cefc9f2807958552a6f0f263dd","amp;dn":"RABBIT+AT+REST+-+John+Updike.+Read+by+Arthur+Morey+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3fbbf0380518cefc9f2807958552a6f0f263dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,63,187,240,56,5,24,206,252,159,40,7,149,133,82,166,240,242,99,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
