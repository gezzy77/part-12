The 1932 version of Girl Crazy de-emphasized the main plot, building up the comic subplot involving a timorous temporary sheriff and a city slicker con man -- the better to accommodate that film&amp;#039;s stars, Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. The 1943 remake does without the comic relief, concentrating on Rooney, a teenaged playboy who is sent to a Western mining school by his father (Henry O&amp;#039;Neill), in the hopes that the Rooney will forsake his wastrel ways. Judy Garland is cast in the role originated on stage by Ginger Rogers: the feisty, lovelorn frontier postmistress Ginger Gray, who falls in love with the hero -- the difference being that Garland has been promoted from postmistress to the daughter of mining-school dean Phineas Armour (Guy Kibbee). The new plot involves a contest for rodeo queen, pitting Ginger against Marjorie Tait (Frances Rafferty), who is also her rival for Rooney&amp;#039;s affections. The contest serves a double purpose: Rooney is hoping that the publicity engendered by the rivalry will attract students to the failing school, proof positive that for all of his bravado, he&amp;#039;s a swell, altruistic guy underneath. These plot complications are merely prologue for a gargantuan musical finale built upon the Gershwin standard &quot;I Got Rhythm,&quot; staged by the film&amp;#039;s original director, Busby Berkeley. Other musical carryovers from the stage play include &quot;Embraceable You,&quot; &quot;Bidin&amp;#039; My Time,&quot; and &quot;But Not for Me.&quot; Featured in the cast are June Allyson, Rags Ragland, and the Tommy Dorsey Band.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035942/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035942/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirectors:\nNorman Taurog\nBusby Berkeley\n\n\n\tMickey Rooney\t... \tDanny Churchill, Jr.\n\n\tJudy Garland\t... \tGinger Gray\n\n\tGil Stratton\t... \tBud Livermore\n\tRobert E.
