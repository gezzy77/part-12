Guilherme, sheltered in a female universe, unable to deal with the uncorresponded love of his sister and her relationships with other boys, ends up running away. After the death of his grandmother Clara, Guilherme refugees himself in his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house, who is immersed in a almost autistic world, which leaves him increasingly isolated. Guilherme discovers that life can not be held in a perfect circle and returns home. When the twins finally meet, they rediscover the sexual tension that surrounded them since the beginning, and love finally takes shape. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow To Draw a Perfect CircleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is intimate and silent in style, offering the pleasure of exploring the limits, creating a closed, claustrophobic universe, innocent and contagious in the simplicity of its emotions, where everyday situations become at times brutal, cruel, yet infused with a strangely perverse beauty.\n\nFile Name .........................................: How to Draw a Perfect Circle.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,349,433,344 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:33:03\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x376 (AR: 1.872)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.262 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1138478/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1138478/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPortuguese and French audio; Portuguese and English subpack\n\nMy rip of the Portuguese DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d59509f4f15e86347a3515b3977c6875eb830a","amp;dn":"Marco+Martins+-+How+to+Draw+a+Perfect+Circle+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d59509f4f15e86347a3515b3977c6875eb830a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,213,149,9,244,241,94,134,52,122,53,21,179,151,124,104,117,235,131,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
