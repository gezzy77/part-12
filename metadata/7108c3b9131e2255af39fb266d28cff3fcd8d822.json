At the dawn of the war, the Nobel Prize winning author shocked his countrymen by publicly siding with the Nazis. His wife Marie took it a step further and went to Germany to give lectures. Following the war, both were convicted and branded as traitors. Hamsun attempts to answer the questions surrounding the author and his wife's treachery. By the time the war erupted, Hamsun was an elderly curmudgeon who could barely hear. A profoundly lonely man with hatred of British Imperialism, he was an easy target for Nazi propaganda. His wife Marie, who in Norway is still more vilified than her husband, also had her reasons to support the German party, but while though-provoking, they don't invite much sympathy. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Hamsun.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,868,521,472 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:32:36\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x376 (AR: 1.872)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1495 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.226 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116480/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116480/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Norwegian | Swedish | German | Danish | English\nSubtitles: Danish, Norwegian, Svedish, English, Frrench, Russian (VobSub format), English, Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by crock99, whom we thank\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7108c3b9131e2255af39fb266d28cff3fcd8d822","amp;dn":"Hamsun+%28Jan+Troell%2C+1996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7108c3b9131e2255af39fb266d28cff3fcd8d822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,8,195,185,19,30,34,85,175,57,251,38,109,40,207,243,252,216,216,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
