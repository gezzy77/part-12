Over  seventeen  feature  films  were\n        produced, including three films  based on the original  Dragon\n        Ball  anime, thirteen films based on the sequel series  Dragon\n        Ball  Z,   and  seventeenth   film  commemorating   the  tenth\n        anniversary  of  the  series.  The  films  were self-contained\n        stories  that  did not  follow  the same  continuity  as their\n        television counterpart.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        It  starts off with Bulma, Krillin, Oolong, and Gohan  camping\n        in the  woods.  But,  a satellite  fell to  earth and starts a\n        forest fire. Gohan and Krillin  put out the flames with  their\n        ki alone. They then wish back the forest with the dragonballs.\n\n        Gohan made a new friend the, little dragon. Then, Turles comes\n        to earth  with his  space pirates  and one  of them plants the\n        seed for the Tree. Kaiosama then warns Goku about the Tree and\n        the rest of the Z Fighters go with him to help. Chi-chi  stops\n        Gohan from going though, so he runs off later with the dragon.\n        The Z Fighters have some trouble with the space pirates except\n        for Goku and  Gohan. Turles captures  Gohan and forces  him to\n        look at an artificial moon's light. Gohan transforms and swats\n        Goku  into the  ground. Turles  is laughing  and enjoying  the\n        father and son fight. Just  when Gohan is about to  kill Goku,\n        the dragon comes and calms him down. Turles gets Gohan mad  by\n        blasting the  dragon. Gohan  lashes out  at Turles,  so Turles\n        tries to kill him with an energy ring. goku slices off Gohan's\n        tail and falls in to his father's arms.\n\n        Goku swears to Gohan that  he will make Turles pay.  The space\n        pirates return  from beating  on the  other fighters,  so Goku\n        swats them  down with  a power  shot. Turles  duels with  Goku\n        after he blasts  Piccolo. Goku is  doing extremely well  until\n        Turles eats the  fruit from the  Tree. He beats  down Goku and\n        nearly kills him. Goku then  gathers energy for a Spirit  Bomb\n        while the  half-dead Z  fighters battle  Turles. Turles  beats\n        them and blasts Goku's Spirit Bomb with one hit. While Goku is\n        unconscious,  he  gathers  energy from  the  Tree  and creates\n        another Spirit Bomb. He confronts Turles once again, this time\n        killing him. The movie ends with the Tree giving back all  its\n        energy to  the world  and all  the Z  fighters camping  in the\n        woods.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;763019041513361e03051e58171f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88db472c789e9d11a0cc37fb4c9fed155bfb0ffe","amp;dn":"Dragon.Ball.Z.Movie.03.The.Tree.Of.Might.1998.WS.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88db472c789e9d11a0cc37fb4c9fed155bfb0ffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,219,71,44,120,158,157,17,160,204,55,251,76,159,237,21,91,251,15,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
