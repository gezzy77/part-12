Tales of the unfortunate, made amusing by the obvious self-depracating quirks of the main character. These songs do include Lovefool, but also the aptly titled &quot;Step on Me&quot;, and the song &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; in which a self-proclaimed loser speaks of her willing self-debasement with random men.\nElsewhere, are clever and tounge-in-cheek descriptions of people's feelings about the nature of love, giddy preparations for a &quot;kinky&quot; meeting between new lovers, and a tale of a wary and bitter attitude of hearing a previous lover use the same words on another naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve target.\nThere isn't one song on here that I couldn't listen to again and again.\nWith all this plus an amusing yet spot-on cover of Black Sabbath's Iron Man, you can't miss this piece of 90s delight. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Your New Cuckoo\n[02] Been It\n[03] Heartbreaker\n[04] Happy Meal II\n[05] Never Recover\n[06] Step On Me\n[07] Lovefool\n[08] Losers\n[09] Iron Man\n[10] Great Divide\n[11] Choke\n \n \n \nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:39m:00s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 95.7mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes 8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\n\nRelease Date\t&gt; 12 August 1996\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; Mercury Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.cardigans.com\n\t\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2efdc34b015231d0f3a75ed22a2ec41da00b2a","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+First+Band+On+The+Moon+The+Cardigans+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2efdc34b015231d0f3a75ed22a2ec41da00b2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,46,253,195,75,1,82,49,208,243,167,94,210,42,46,196,29,160,11,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
