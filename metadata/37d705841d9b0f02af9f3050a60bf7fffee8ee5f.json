Can Raphael's La Muta compare with Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa ? How was impressionism a rejection of traditional artistic techniques? How was the Cubist movement born? These are questions that occur to us as we stand before a work of art. To understand a piece we want to know the artist, his environment, how he worked, what influenced him. In Great Painters, the masterpieces of artists from Giotto to Picasso come down from the walls of museums and galleries to be reproduced faithfully on the pages of this book. But they take on a more immediate and intelligible dimension surrounded here by the full color illustrations of Piero Ventura, depicting the dramatic events and people that were a part of each painting's creation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d705841d9b0f02af9f3050a60bf7fffee8ee5f","amp;dn":"Great+painters+by+Piero+Ventura+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d705841d9b0f02af9f3050a60bf7fffee8ee5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,215,5,132,29,155,15,2,175,159,48,80,166,11,247,255,254,232,238,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
