It was directed by Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg, and stars James Fox and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones in his film acting debut.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nChas (James Fox) is a sexual sadist, misogynist and professional &quot;performer,&quot; a violent enforcer for an East London gang led by Harry Flowers (Johnny Shannon). Chas disobeys Flowers' instructions to not involve himself in the takeover of a betting shop owned by Joey Maddocks (Anthony Valentine), a childhood enemy with whom he has a &quot;history&quot;. As retaliation, Maddocks and an associate subsequently overpower and torture Chas in his apartment but he turns the tables, killing Maddocks. Chas is forced to go on the run, from the police and from his former colleagues and dyes his hair red with house paint. Overhearing that a musician tenant is being evicted for non-payment of rent from &quot;a perfect little hidey hole&quot; in the basement apartment of a house owned by Turner (Mick Jagger), he ingratiates himself with Pherber (Anita Pallenberg), one of the female inhabitants and moves in.\n\nTurner is a reclusive, eccentric former rock star who has &quot;lost his demon&quot; and who lives there with his female friends Pherber and Lucy (Michele Breton), with whom he enjoys a non-possessive and bi-sexual mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nage ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  trois. At first, Chas is contemptuous of Turner and Turner attempts to return the rent paid in advance but they start influencing each other. Chas also enjoys intimate moments with Pherber during which he shows his homophobic tendencies. Pherber and Turner understand his conflict and want to understand what makes him function so well within his world. To speed up the process they make him take hallucinogenic drugs (Amanita muscaria). After that evening Chas opens up. He begins a caring relationship with Lucy, implying that he outgrew the psychological boundaries he was stuck in due to having to function as a male man within a gangster world.\n\nConsequently, at the end of the film Turner is shot by Chas and Pherber is last seen hiding in a cupboard. Chas seems to agree to be 'welcomed back' to his former boss Harry Flowers by Rosie (Stanley Meadows), another Flowers thug; we understand that they are going to kill him. As the car drives off, the face we see through the window is ambiguous - it could be Chas or it could be Turner: it is Mick Jagger but dressed in the clothes and wig we last saw Chas in..\n[edit] Cast\n\n    * James Fox as Chas\n    * Mick Jagger as Turner\n    * Anita Pallenberg as Pherber\n    * MichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le Breton as Lucy\n    * Ann Sidney as Dana\n    * John Bindon as Moody\n    * Stanley Meadows as Rosebloom\n    * Allan Cuthbertson as The Lawyer\n    * Anthony Morton as Dennis\n    * Johnny Shannon as Harry Flowers\n    * Anthony Valentine as Joey Maddocks\n    * Kenneth Colley as Tony Farrell\n    * John Sterland as The Chauffeur\n    * Laraine Wickens as Lorraine\n\n Production\n\nPerformance was initially conceived by Donald Cammell as &quot;The Performers&quot; and was to be a lighthearted swinging 60's romp. At one stage, Cammell's friend Marlon Brando (with whom he later collaborated on the posthumously published novel Fan Tan) was to play the gangster role which became &quot;Chas&quot;. At that stage the story involved an American gangster hiding out in London. James Fox, previously cast in rather upper crust roles, eventually took the place of Brando, and spent several months in South London among the criminal underworld researching his role.[1]\n\nAs the project evolved the story became significantly darker. Cammell was heavily influenced by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges (a portrait of Borges on a book cover can be seen at a crucial moment in the film) as he redrafted the script to create an intense, intellectual film dealing with issues of identity crisis. Artaud's theories on the links between performing and madness also influenced Cammell. Cammell and co-director Nicolas Roeg (mainly responsible for the 'look' of the film) also benefited from a lack of interference from Warner Bros. studio executives, who believed they were getting a Rolling Stones equivalent of the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night (1964). Instead, Cammell and Roeg delivered a dark, experimental film which included graphic depictions of violence, sex and drug use.\n\nIt was intended that the Rolling Stones would write the soundtrack but due to the complicated nature of the various relationships both on and off-screen, this never happened. It was widely rumoured that Anita Pallenberg, then in a relationship with Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger played out sexual scenes in the film 'for real' (out-takes of these scenes apparently won a prize at an Amsterdam adult film festival). When Keith Richards heard the rumours, he apparently took to sitting in his car outside the house where the film was being shot. Needless to say, this didn't do much for the Jagger-Richards musical chemistry and the soundtrack came together from a number of sources.\n\nThe film has gained notoriety due to the difficulties it faced in getting on screen. The film's content was a surprise to the studio. It has been reported that during a test screening, one Warner executive's wife vomited in shock.[2] The response from the studio was to deny the film a cinematic release. It has been claimed that at one stage Warner Bros. wanted the negative to be destroyed.\n\nPerformance was finally released in 1970 after several recuts, dubbing of Cockney accents and changes in Warner's administration. Different edits were shown around the world. Home video versions of the 1990s used the US edit.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nAmazon.com\n&quot;I like that. Turn it up!&quot; Performance is the Altamont of '60s cinema; psychedelic and hallucinatory, decadent and depraved, polymorphous-perverse. And you can dance to it! Melding the sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll ethos of swinging '60s London with the gangster film, Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell's genre-bending cult classic is so mind blowing that star James Fox did not act in a film again for nearly a decade. Fox stars as Chas, an &quot;out of date&quot; enforcer for crime kingpin Harry Flowers. Chas is a &quot;nutcase,&quot; who likes &quot;a little cavort,&quot; but when he kills someone he wasn't supposed to, he is forced to go on the lam. He takes refuge in a basement room belonging to Turner (Mick Jagger), a former rock star who has &quot;lost his demon&quot; and now lives as a recluse in his dilapidated house with his secretary/lover, Pherber (Anita Pallenberg, who was Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards' girlfriend at the time), and an androgynous French girl (Michele Breton). They enjoy a little cavorting themselves. In these drug-strewn surroundings, worlds collide and identities merge. &quot;I know who I am,&quot; Chas tells Harry early on. He (and viewers) will become less sure as Performance unfolds. Completed in 1968 but shelved for two years, Performance was originally rated X and has been redesignated R. But it's still strong, potent stuff. With its elliptical editing, mirror images, and echoed dialogue that bridges the two worlds, Performance may not become clearer with repeat viewings, but there are fresh discoveries to be made each time. The killer soundtrack features Randy Newman, Ry Cooder, rap revolutionaries the Last Poets, and Jagger's own astounding &quot;Memo from Turner.&quot; &quot;I know a thing of two about performing, my boy,&quot; Turner tells Chas at one point. &quot;The only performance that makes it... that makes it all the way, is the one that achieves madness.&quot; Performance makes it all the way. As Roeg is quoted in a featurette produced for this DVD, &quot;After all this time, its mystery is part of its magic and attraction.&quot; --Donald Liebenson\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6003960/The_American_Religion_Defined_In_The_Declaration_of_Independence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6003960/The_American_Religion_Defined_In_The_Declaration_of_Independence&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6000903/Sit_Down_And_Get_High_With_God_-_Cannabis_Is_Holy_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6000903/Sit_Down_And_Get_High_With_God_-_Cannabis_Is_Holy_&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b274220fd5cf23b92fb1bb699c0dd59473796d5","amp;dn":"Performance+%281970%29+Mick+Jagger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b274220fd5cf23b92fb1bb699c0dd59473796d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,39,66,32,253,92,242,59,146,251,27,182,153,192,221,89,71,55,150,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
