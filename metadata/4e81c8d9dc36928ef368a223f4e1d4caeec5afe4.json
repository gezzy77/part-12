Scattered along your path are duplicate jewel boards that may contain clues as to where to find the Oracle of Ur, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll run into more than just a bit romantic tension between our three heroes before all is said and done.\n\nLike past installments, Oracle of Ur is far more a hidden object game than a match-three one. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make your way through some fairly standard point and click gameplay, unlocking scenes or puzzles as you go along (like a tile rotation puzzle that has you opening a locked door, for instance), and only occasionally actually coming across a new jewel board to complete. These hidden object scenes simply ask you to find a selection of items on a list, but there are also jewel board fragments, gems and hint coins scattered throughout each location, making this a more lengthy experience if you wish to find each and every item available.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7906/screen_21.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7906/screen_21.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7906/jqm4-screenshots.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamezebo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/games/7906/jqm4-screenshots.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.downeu.net/uploads/posts/2011-03-30/340331-0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.downeu.net/uploads/posts/2011-03-30/340331-0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gfxtra.com/uploads/posts_images/1/6/166889/47630952105601370506762603512866.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gfxtra.com/uploads/posts_images/1/6/166889/47630952105601370506762603512866.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e81c8d9dc36928ef368a223f4e1d4caeec5afe4","amp;dn":"Jewel+Quest+Mysteries+The+Oracle+of+Ur+CE+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Fo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e81c8d9dc36928ef368a223f4e1d4caeec5afe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,129,200,217,220,54,146,142,243,104,162,35,244,225,212,202,238,197,175,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
