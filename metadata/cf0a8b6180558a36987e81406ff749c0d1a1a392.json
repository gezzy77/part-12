It is a look into the future, since many of the projects were adopted and adapted to the postwar needs of the victorious Allies. This volume covers German day fighters and interceptors plus multi-engined heavy day fighters known to the Germans as Zerstorers. This book also explores the background and conditions that facilitated the creation of so many diverse designs.\n\ntitle link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0a8b6180558a36987e81406ff749c0d1a1a392","amp;dn":"Jet+Planes+of+the+Third+Reich%3A+The+Secret+Projects%2C+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0a8b6180558a36987e81406ff749c0d1a1a392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,10,139,97,128,85,138,54,152,126,129,64,111,247,73,192,209,161,163,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
