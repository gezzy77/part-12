He was one of the most celebrated violin virtuosi of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His Caprice No. 24 in A minor, Op. 1, is among the best known of his compositions, and has served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n\nRuggiero Ricci (born July 24, 1918) is an Italian-American violin virtuoso who has become famous in particular for his performances and recordings of the works of Paganini. He was born in San Bruno, California. Ricci's brother is cellist George Ricci.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01. - Caprice for solo violin N?01 in E major (1:45)\n02. - Caprice for solo violin N?02 in B minor (2:54)\n03. - Caprice for solo violin N?03 in E minor (2:50)\n04. - Caprice for solo violin N?04 in C minor (5:29)\n05. - Caprice for solo violin N?05 in A minor (2:21)\n06. - Caprice for solo violin N?06 in G minor (5:31)\n07. - Caprice for solo violin N?07 in A minor (2:54)\n08. - Caprice for solo violin N?08 in E flat major (2:35)\n09. - Caprice for solo violin N?09 in E major (2:24)\n10. - Caprice for solo violin N?10 in G minor (1:57)\n11. - Caprice for solo violin N?11 in C major (4:05)\n12. - Caprice for solo violin N?12 in A flat major (2:38)\n13. - Caprice for solo violin N?13 in B flat major (2:21)\n14. - Caprice for solo violin N?14 in E flat major (1:33)\n15. - Caprice for solo violin N?15 in E minor (2:23)\n16. - Caprice for solo violin N?16 in G minor (1:15)\n17. - Caprice for solo violin N?17 in E flat major (2:44)\n18. - Caprice for solo violin N?18 in C major (1:53)\n19. - Caprice for solo violin N?19 in E flat major (2:37)\n20. - Caprice for solo violin N?20 in D major (3:37)\n21. - Caprice for solo violin N?21 in A major (2:59)\n22. - Caprice for solo violin N?22 in F major (2:41)\n23. - Caprice for solo violin N?23 in E flat major (3:27)\n24. - Caprice for solo violin N?24 in A minor (5:27) Download:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83806644927f1d66752ec39c87a31b00bedd47c","amp;dn":"Paganini+-+24+Caprices+For+Solo+Violin+%28Ruggiero+Ricci%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83806644927f1d66752ec39c87a31b00bedd47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,56,6,100,73,39,241,214,103,82,236,57,200,122,49,176,11,237,212,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
