It really is a work in progress that requires constant ongoing effort, as it continues to grow daily.  But I ran across a situation where I no longer had a 2014 album which I had previously shared here a couple of months ago.  And the easiest way for me to reacquire that title was to jump onto the bundle, and get it that way.\n\nAlthough the bundle was already a couple of months old, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many seeders were still sharing it.  It took mere minutes to download and complete my missing album.  But even better yet, I had three or four other people connected to me, downloading it from me just as fast as I was able to download it from others.  So it really was nice to know something we shared amongst ourselves two months ago, music many of us have perhaps moved on from, is still drawing interest by downloaders today.\n\nOn that note, 911ij has been trying to mirror all of these bundles onto usenet for those Usenet Users to enjoy.  Last I heard, he's gotten all 41 bundles from 2014, all 57 bundles from 2013, and he's currently working on the 55 bundles we shared back in 2012.  He's then got to work on 2011.  Unfortunately once I share a bundle, I no longer leave the music in bundle format.  And as time passes, I sometimes reacquire certain albums, meaning it's almost impossible for me to reseed older bundles.  But if any of you are able to help him out in his efforts, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCONTEMPORARY: Alastair Wilde, For The Fatherless, Jalisa Faye, Joe Cirafici, Kathryn Scott, Louise B Calixte, Raymond Gregory.
