Iconography in motion, as magic. She is such an intricate part of everything that moves, that it's all a part of the same vision... She's very into making sure that everything has its place. The video is really fun and exciting and she looks awesome in it. ... It's Lady Gaga! It's a Lady Gaga video! It's a good video. It's really fun.&quot;On the day of its premiere, Gaga said that her team used a lot of different looks with each being very representative of different parts of her and her obsession with transforming.\n\nMEDIA INFO\n\nVIDEO\n\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;84ccede3ecc4c8b1aab4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 6 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 3mn 34s\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 200 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 904 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 010 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.885\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.026\nWriting library                          : x264 core 120\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\nColor primaries                          : BT.709\nTransfer characteristics                 : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients                      : BT.709\n\nAUDIO\n\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 3mn 34s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nTHUMBNAILS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/JRWejyPQ/1376931817_thumbnails.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/JRWejyPQ/1376931817_thumbnails.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes:\n\n* Recommended to use latest version VLC Media Player.\n* Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).\n* Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.\n\nEncoder Notes: Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide DVDScr, R5, DVDRips, BluRay, Direct Audio, Early Music\nReleases, Seedboxes, Links, Dedicated Servers anything u can provide, Advance / Promo CDs/DVDs.
