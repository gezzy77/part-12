By 1656, he is bankrupt but consoles himself with the company of pretty maid Hendrickje, whom he's unable to marry. Their relationship brings ostracism but also some measure of happiness. The final scenes find him in his last year, 1669, physically enfeebled but his spirit undimmed. \n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : Rembrandt.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 245 Kbps\nLength            : 1.33 GiB for 1h 24mn 43s 996ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 540 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028167/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028167/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip of Eclipse (Criterion) DVD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c1d846334cf5fc28d0313ce14e73c8434e9aa7f","amp;dn":"Rembrandt+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c1d846334cf5fc28d0313ce14e73c8434e9aa7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,29,132,99,52,207,95,194,141,3,19,206,20,231,60,132,52,233,170,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
