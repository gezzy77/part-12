It's safe and delightful background music for the holiday season, and her sultry vocals make the otherwise two-dimensional backing music seem rich and full. For the most part the collection is easygoing and pleasant, with the highlight being her beautiful interpretation of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and the lowlight most definitely being an acrobatic and vocally dramatic &quot;Angel Man&quot; as the album's closer. It's a very nice record on the whole, but likely of enjoyment only to LaBelle's die-hard fans. Most casual listeners would find this CD to be nothing more than a passing holiday fancy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4172cb8853f6d28a7f4c03330788d876a5d252","amp;dn":"Patti+LaBelle+-+20th+Century+Masters%3A+The+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4172cb8853f6d28a7f4c03330788d876a5d252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,65,114,203,136,83,246,210,138,127,76,3,51,7,136,216,118,165,210,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
