EAT YOUR CREW.\n\nTake the helm of your customised steamship and set sail for the unknown! Sunless Sea is a 2D game of discovery, survival and loneliness set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London. Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot?\n\nEvents can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\n\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\nKey features\n\n    A deep, compelling world packed with secrets and stories\n    Beautiful, hand drawn 2D art\n    Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n    Real-time, pausable combat with dozens of different abilities\n    Leave a legacy! When you die (and you will) your next captain may choose to inherit a skill, a chart of discovered islands or a beloved officer.\n    Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n    Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n    Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n    Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine and hallucinogenic honey...\n    Cross the wide black sea\n    Find your way home \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d930b8c95dd3e1fba38f1647a7f37f76ffa1e76","amp;dn":"Sunless+Sea+v0.5.2.1478","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d930b8c95dd3e1fba38f1647a7f37f76ffa1e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,147,11,140,149,221,62,31,186,56,241,100,122,127,55,247,111,250,30,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
