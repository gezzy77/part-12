The film explores ideas of abundance, emptiness, human connection and abandonment while observing an interweaving web of awkward characters who maintain hope by inventing their own forms of communication and self-fulfillment. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sad valentine to the forgotten discards of a throwaway society, and a story about knowing when to hold on, and when to let go.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 4.9/10\nDirected by: Matt McCormick\nStarring: Carrie Brownstein, James Mercer and Renee Roman Nose\n\nRelease Name: Some.Days.Are.Better.Than.Others.2010.DVDRip.XviD-IGUANA\nSize: 1CD\nVideo: XviD | 624 x 352 | 900 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 93 min\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2a2e5a5a0c696b37f98f753267339be3f789ed5","amp;dn":"Some.Days.Are.Better.Than.Others.2010.DVDRip.XviD-IGUANA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2a2e5a5a0c696b37f98f753267339be3f789ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,162,229,165,160,198,150,179,127,152,247,83,38,115,57,190,63,120,158,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
