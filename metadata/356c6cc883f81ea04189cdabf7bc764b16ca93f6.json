The contributors describe different biomarker studies pertaining to brain injury and other neurological disorders and analyze the different models and technologies used to identify these biological markers. The book includes findings from &quot;Omics research&quot; that have been utilized to decipher and identify such biomarkers. It discusses protein, microRNA, and altered gene profiles and reviews neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and prion and AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356c6cc883f81ea04189cdabf7bc764b16ca93f6","amp;dn":"+%09Biomarkers+of+Brain+Injury+and+Neurological+Disorders+%5BMyeBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356c6cc883f81ea04189cdabf7bc764b16ca93f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,108,108,200,131,248,30,160,65,137,205,171,247,188,118,75,22,202,147,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
