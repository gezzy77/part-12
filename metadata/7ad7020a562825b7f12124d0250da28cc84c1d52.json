Some reviewers call Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia the best reference work on animals ever published. Others call it the legacy left to us by famed zoologist and animal lover, Bernhard Grzimek. The accolades and praise go on for the newest addition to Gale's line of reference titles. The original 13-vol. set, published in Germany in the late 1960s, is internationally renowned for its scientific reporting, coverage and illustrations, and serves as a major point of reference for researchers and students studying the animal kingdom. Thorough articles familiarize readers with animals found everywhere on the globe, detailing their life cycles, predators, food systems, overall ecology and much more. Staying true to the original scientific pedigree, Gale enlisted prominent advisors and contributors from the international scientific community to incorporate recent developments in the animal world. Our new editions of Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia are sure to serve the needs of students at every academic level.\n\n.......................\n\nBrowse my other torrents :)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed after you finish, and share with others anywhere not just through the net only (flash disks, burn to disks, send via emails...etc) to friends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors....\nI hope that you will benefit from the books and stuff :)\nSHARING IS CARING :p\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to write to me:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;325057464657405f535c5c0a00724b535a5d5d1c5153&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad7020a562825b7f12124d0250da28cc84c1d52","amp;dn":"Animal+Life+Encyclopedia+vol+1-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad7020a562825b7f12124d0250da28cc84c1d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,215,2,10,86,40,37,183,241,33,36,208,37,13,162,140,200,76,29,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
