Rapid Modeling is generally based on queuing theory, but other mathematical modeling techniques are of interest, as are simulation models to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from theory to application, providing the theoretical foundations for successful lead time reduction.\n\nThe interested reader (researcher as well as practitioner) should have a good overview of current activity in this field. Rapid Modeling for Increasing Competitiveness suggests that companies which are equipped for speed, with innovative processes, will outperform their slower competitors in many industries. Furthermore, this work also contributes to the scientific fields of operations management, production management, supply chain management, industrial engineering and operations research. The research papers presented in this book can be used to support the exchange of knowledge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ between researchers, as well as practitioners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ on the subject of increasing competitiveness through speed. Rapid Modeling for Increasing Competitiveness is supported by the EU Seventh Framework Programme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The People Programme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways Project (No. 217891) &quot;How revolutionary queuing based modeling software helps keeping jobs in Europe. The creation of a lead time reduction software that increases industry competitiveness and supports academic research.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4dc60636c688d1e1ba2a31994c9fb43dee019d","amp;dn":"Rapid+Modelling+for+Increasing+Competitiveness%3A+Tools+and+Mindse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4dc60636c688d1e1ba2a31994c9fb43dee019d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,77,198,6,54,198,136,209,225,186,42,49,153,76,159,180,61,238,1,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
