I am in the process of obtaining and sharing them all. I will also continue to collect as more soundtracks are released.\nI previously listed there being twelve, but I recently discovered they are German releases of radio plays. I don't think I'll be obtaining those in the near future...my German is nonexistent.\n\nThis album covers the first four films released: Nutcracker, Rapunzel, Swan Lake and The Princess and the Pauper. There is a promo CD for The Princess and the Pauper, but this collection contains each track plus more, so I will not be uploading that album.\n\nBarbie Sings!
