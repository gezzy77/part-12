It features performances by a number of rock bands that emerged from the San Francisco music scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Santana, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The film also contains extensive footage of concert promoter Bill Graham, who organized the concerts and ran the Fillmore West. Additionally, the film includes documentary footage shot several years earlier in and around San Francisco, showing the emergence of the music scene there amid the counterculture of the 1960s and the hippie movement.[5]\n\nFillmore was shot on 16 mm film and was released in a widescreen format with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It makes frequent use of split screen images.\n\nEnjoy, share &amp; please seed :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db7ca67b8d169132b9c63024fa27d5038ecbf57d","amp;dn":"FILLMORE+The+Last+Days+Concert+Film+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db7ca67b8d169132b9c63024fa27d5038ecbf57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,124,166,123,141,22,145,50,185,198,48,36,250,39,213,3,142,203,245,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
