Yet more than merely the story of &quot;The Man Who Made The Beatles,&quot; The Fifth Beatle is an uplifting, tragic, and ultimately inspirational human story about the struggle to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Brian Epstein was homosexual when it was a felony to be so in the United Kingdom, Jewish at a time of anti-Semitism, and from Liverpool when it was considered just a dingy port town. He helped spread the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ message of love to the entire world, yet died painfully lonely at the young age of thirty-two, consumed by staggering ambition and the endless struggles that came with it.\n\nBoth heartbreaking and uplifting, The Fifth Beatle not only reveals an important, unsung chapter in the history of the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â€but it will inspire anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever dared to believe in a dream.\n\nNote: This comic has already been uploaded on here, but this version is in HD, which is why I decided to upload it.\n\nFor anyone who cares, here's my release thread, I'll be posting all of my torrents there: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd384d431e0e22e1445e9912f99ba3aae5fc44ee","amp;dn":"The+Fifth+Beatle+-+The+Brian+Epstein+Story+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28Son","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd384d431e0e22e1445e9912f99ba3aae5fc44ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,56,77,67,30,14,34,225,68,94,153,18,249,155,163,170,229,252,68,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
