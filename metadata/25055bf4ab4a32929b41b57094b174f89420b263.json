Experts Alex Langlands and Annie Gray join them to tell the incredible story of our daily bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  1830s \r\nThe journey begins in 1837, when bread was the mainstay of most diets and bakers were at the heart of every community. A rural bake house has been kitted out exactly as it would have been in the 1830s. The bakers must get to grips with centuries-old methods of breadmaking and that means doing absolutely everything by hand. The first loaves are made with heritage wheat flour and brewers' yeast in a tiny wood-fired oven. It is bog standard bread that fed Victorian rural workers but to modern palettes it is an absolute revelation. Fifth-generation baker John Swift gets a taste of the bread his ancestors once made and artisan baker Duncan is in his element in this unhurried, organic world. There is no shop, so the bakers deliver door-to-door. For industrial baker John Foster, who deals with customers as far afield as China, the fixed demand and lack of competition enjoyed by Victorian bakers, is an utter joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2989 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06vn7sj\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=What%20the%20Victorians%20did%20for%20Us \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Victorians \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Victorian%20Pharmacy \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Victorian%20Farm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25055bf4ab4a32929b41b57094b174f89420b263","amp;dn":"BBC+Victorian+Bakers+Series+1+1of3+1830s+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25055bf4ab4a32929b41b57094b174f89420b263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,5,91,244,171,74,50,146,155,65,181,112,148,177,116,248,148,32,178,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
