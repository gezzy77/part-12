Now, in this landmark series; First Life, he completes his journey by going back in time to the very roots of the tree of life, in search of the very first animals.\n\nFrom the fog bound coastline of Newfoundland to the deserts of North Africa and the rainforests of Queensland, Attenborough finds evidence in fossils and living animals of an extraordinary period in Earth's history, half a billion years ago, when animals first appeared in the oceans. From the first eyes that saw, to the first predators that killed and the first legs that walked on land, these were creatures that evolved the traits and tools that allow all animals, including us, to survive to this day.\n\nStunning photography and state of the art visual effects combine with the captivating charm of the world's favourite naturalist. Bringing together fossil finds from the last few years that have transformed our understanding of early life forms with photorealistic CGI technology, First Life brings these animals and their environments back to life in brilliant detail.\n\n\n1) Arrival\nAttenborough's journey begins in a forest near his childhood home in Leicester, where a fossil discovery transformed our understanding of the evolution of complex life. Travelling to the fog bound coastline of Newfoundland and the Australian outback, Attenborough unearths the earliest forms of animal life to exist on Earth. These bizarre and wonderful creatures are brought to life with the help of cutting edge scientific technology and photorealistic visual effects. From the first animal forms that moved to the first mouths that ate, these were creatures that evolved the traits and tools that allow all animals, including ourselves, to survive to this day.\n\n2) Conquest\nAttenborough's journey continues in Canada's Rocky Mountains, where fossils document an explosion in animal diversity never seen before or since. Travelling from there to North Africa, the rainforests of Australia and the east coast of Scotland, Attenborough discovers how animals evolved to conquer not only the oceans but also the land and air. These remote and fascinating creatures are brought to life as never before with the help of cutting-edge scientific technology and photorealistic visual effects. From the first large predators to the first legs on land, these were creatures that evolved the traits and tools that allow all animals, including ourselves, to survive to this day.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:623e93ece38ff6093361dca26cfa5e7689d7ce34","amp;dn":"David+Attenborough%5C%27s+First+Life+-+Part+1++%28BBC+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"623e93ece38ff6093361dca26cfa5e7689d7ce34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,62,147,236,227,143,246,9,51,97,220,162,108,250,94,118,137,215,206,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
