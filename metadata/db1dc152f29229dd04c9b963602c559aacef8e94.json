You may need to change something.\n\n----------------------\nAdditional Information\n----------------------\n\nThis game is an old classic that most hardcore Trek fans will know well.\nThe problem is that it was written in the 90&amp;#039;s to be played in DOS.\nGetting this game to work in Windows XP is a pain in the arse.\nHowever, I managed to get it working great on my Windows XP machine.\nMainly thanks to discovering a little gem of software called &quot;DOSBox&quot;\n\nMore information on DOSBox and the latest version can be found at...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dosbox.sourceforge.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dosbox.sourceforge.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriginally, I set out to get Final Unity working just for myself.\n\nOnce I played it again, I really wanted to share it with anyone else\nout there who enjoyed this game or missed it in the 90&amp;#039;s.\n\nYes it&amp;#039;s dated, but it&amp;#039;s really well done, particularly all the\ndialogue from the original Star Trek TNG cast :)\n\nAs an added bonus, I&amp;#039;ve captured some of Final Unity cutscenes to a folder.\nThese are in NTSC VCD format as the cutscenes are low res to begin with ;)\n\nI have also downloaded some walkthroughs and cheats too.\n\nThere are a couple of saved games that take you right to the end of the\ngame. Feel free to overwrite them :)\n\nHope you enjoy this game as much as I have.\n\nPlease leave a comment wherever you downloaded this from if you enjoy it :)\n\ndjarmani - March 2007\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1dc152f29229dd04c9b963602c559aacef8e94","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+TNG+-+A+Final+Unity+-+PC+-+Updated+to+run+on+modern+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1dc152f29229dd04c9b963602c559aacef8e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,29,193,82,242,146,41,221,4,201,185,99,96,44,85,154,172,239,142,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
