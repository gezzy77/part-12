It was a way of life for the fans and the bands that subscribed to the cult during the early Seventies. It was about music and fashion and above all - about having fun and lots of hit records. A surprising range of artist came under the Glam Rock Banner, many of them featured on this indispensable collection. There's drummer Cozy Powell, who scored a great hit with 'Dance With The Devil' and Cockney Rebel whose singer Steve Harley came up with the classic 'Make Me Smile.' Barefoot Sue created a stomping, percussive hit with 'I'm Standing In The Road' and Wizard created a party mood with 'See My Baby Jive.'\n\nTracklist:\nCD 1\n01.
