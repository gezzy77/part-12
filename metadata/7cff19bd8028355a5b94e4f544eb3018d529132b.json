ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a rival to the best work of Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe, Eggs Over Easy, et al. (and no surprise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Brinsleys played on this album).\nOpening with the gorgeous, Dylanesque Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sebastian,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ built on a lyrical acoustic guitar part, Graham reveals himself a songwriter and player of extraordinary sensitivity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he might easily have been another Alan Hull, or even bigger than that, had he been able to join a band with legs or hold his own career together. As it is, from that Dylan-like start, he and the BrinsleysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\ndeliver a brace of full electric numbers that rival the classic sound of the Band, starting with Ã¢â‚¬Å“So LonelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the roots rock sound here is so authentically American that it will fool lots of listeners about its origins and source. For this album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Girl That Turned the LeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“For a Little WhileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are two of the finest working-class/folk-style compositions this side of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues to SnowyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes Graham into Lynyrd Skynyrd territory. Ã¢â‚¬Å“BelfastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finally takes listeners to GrahamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real roots, in a bracing, fiddle-driven folk-based piece from that side of the Atlantic.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cff19bd8028355a5b94e4f544eb3018d529132b","amp;dn":"Ernie+Graham+-+Ernie+Graham+%5BRemastered%5D+%281971+2014%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cff19bd8028355a5b94e4f544eb3018d529132b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,255,25,189,128,40,53,90,91,148,228,245,68,235,48,24,213,41,19,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
