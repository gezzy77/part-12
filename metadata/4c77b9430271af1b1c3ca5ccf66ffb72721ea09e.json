This geographical area is the same as the 'Gen-X' VFR photographic ground scenery released by Horizon simulation software. Although designed to fit in to 'Gen-X', users do NOT need this to use this product, how ever I would recommend it for the ultimate visual experience.\n\nEach airfields is made to a high standard with photo real textures in many places. A lot of the airfields are totally new, but some parts are imported from previous work but updated in many ways. Designed specially for FSX, the scenery uses a lot of the FSX objects and effects, like moving road traffic, flying birds and conventional 'AFD' taxiways and runways. The scenery is compatible with FSX RTM, SP1, Acceleration and SP2 variants. As the designer I would say SP1 is best platform for optimal display, but the other versions are fine.\n \n\nOther smaller farm and glider strips will be added in the future as this project grows in to a comprehensive collection all UK airfields.\n\n\n\nAirports/Airfields Included\n\n\nBadmington \nBembridge \nBenson (RAF) \nBiggin Hill \nBlackbushe \nBodmin \nBoscombe Down (MOD) \nBournemouth \nBristol \nBrize Norton \nCanterbury \nCardiff \nChalgrove \nChivernor (MOD) \nClacton \nColerne \nCompton Abbas \nCuldrose (RNAS) \nDavidstow Moor \nDenham,EGLD \nDunkeswell \nEaglescott \nElstree \nExeter \nFairford (RAF) \nFairoaks \nFarnborough \nFilton (Bae) \nChichester/Goodwood\nHalton \nHaverfordwest \nHenstridge \nIsle of wight(Sandown) \nKemble,EGBP \nKent Int (RAF Manston) \nKidlington (Oxford) \nLands End \nLasham \nLashenden/Headcorn \nLee on solent \nLondon City \nLondon Gatwick \nLondon Heathrow \nLydd,EGMD \nLyneham (RAF) \nMiddle Wallop \nNeatheravon \nNorth Weald \nNortholt (RAF) \nOaksey Park \nOdiham \nOld Sarum \nPanshanger \nPembrey \nPerrenporth \nPlymouth \nPopham \nPortland\nRedhill \nRendcombe \nRochester \nShoreham \nSouthampton \nSouthend \nSt Marys \nNewquay-St Mawgen \nSt. Athan (DERA) \nStapleford \nSwansea \nThame (Aylesbury) \nThruxton \nTruro \nUpavon \nWhite Waltham \nWroughton \nWycombe Air Park \nYeovil (Westlands) \nYeovilton (RNAS)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c77b9430271af1b1c3ca5ccf66ffb72721ea09e","amp;dn":"FSX+-+UK2000+VFR+AIRFIELDS+VOLUME1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c77b9430271af1b1c3ca5ccf66ffb72721ea09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,119,185,67,2,113,175,27,28,60,165,204,246,111,251,114,114,30,160,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
