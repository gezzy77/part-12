Produced in 2011, this heartfelt and funny feature film includes a well-known ensemble cast in both Secular and Christian markets. Jeff Fahey (Lost, Machete, Wyatt Earp), David A.R. White (In The Blink of an Eye, The Visitation), Reginald Vel Johnson (Die Hard 1 &amp; 2, Family Matters), Victoria Jackson (Soccer Mom, Saturday Night Live), Anna Zielinski (Coach Carter) and Tommy Blaze (Run On, Rumpelstiltskin) star in this funny, heartfelt story about the difficulties many marriages face and the simple solution. A trio of unhappily married couples head to a mountain retreat where they are subjected to unorthodox and seemingly comical methods by the Dr. Sullivan (FAHEY) and his wife Katrina (JACKSON). As the couples struggle through the program for marital bliss, they soon discover it s not Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ they are missing from their lives but Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Jesus. Marriage Retreat is a comical and at times serious look at others as they display the problems of each marriage.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 8.6/10 from 23 users\nDirected by: David Christiaan\nStarring: Jeff Fahey, David A.R.
