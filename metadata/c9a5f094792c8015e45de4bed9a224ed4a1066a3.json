The plane carrying them \n\ncrashes into the Himalayas, apparently leaving them as the only two survivors. After taking shelter in the ruins of an ancient \ntemple, Lara discovers an ornate stone dais holding a sword whilst searching for firewood. She unwittingly activates the ancient \n\nartefact and watches in horror as her mother vanishes in front of her eyes into a portal.\nYears after the plane crash, Lara, now an adult, travels to Bolivia after one of her friends, Anaya Imanu, mentions a stone dais \n\nlocated in the ruins of Tiwanaku, a pre-Incan civilisation. After following a twisting rocky path, she runs into a group of \nmercenaries who are under orders to attack her on sight. After disposing of them, she proceeds to a temple encountering more \n\nmercenaries and dangerous native wildlife along the way. On the other side of the temple, she sees the dais and finds James \nRutland, an American socialite and self-proclaimed adventurer. Rutland mentions Amanda Evert, a friend of Lara's who supposedly \n\ndied years before, and then orders his mercenaries to kill Lara. She overcomes them and reaches the dais, confirming that it was \nthe same as the Himalayan one.\nLara meets Anaya at a village in Peru, and after another battle with Rutland's mercenaries, they reach the tomb in ParaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­so, where \n\na tragedy befell them years ago. A flashback sequence shows Lara on an archaeological excavation with her university \n\ncolleagues,where she and Amanda witness an unknown entity kill the rest of the team. The entity vanishes when Amanda removes a \n\nmysterious glowing stone from a wall, but this also causes a cave-in that floods the cavern. Amanda becomes trapped under a pile \n\nof rubble, \nleaving Lara with no choice but to escape or drown: she flees the cavern, seemingly leaving Amanda to her death.\n\n\n\nMinimum system requirements are:\n================================\n\nMicrosoft Windows 2000, XP, Pentium 3 1.0Ghz or Athlon XP Equivalent, 256MB RAM, 100% DirectX 9.0c -compatible 64MB 3D \nAccelerated Card with TnL (GeForce 3Ti / Radeon 9 series). \nMicrosoft Windows 2000/XP compatible sound card (100% DirectX 9.0c -compatible), Quad-speed (4x) DVD-ROM drive, 9.9GB free disk\nspace, 100% Windows 2000/XP compatible mouse and keyboard.\n\n\n\n\n                      ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a5f094792c8015e45de4bed9a224ed4a1066a3","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+TOMB+RAIDER+LEGEND+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a5f094792c8015e45de4bed9a224ed4a1066a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,165,240,148,121,44,128,21,228,93,228,190,217,162,36,237,74,16,102,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
