It's a typical mid 70s program for the virbraphonist featuring such staples as &quot; I Showed Them, &quot; Milt ackson's &quot; Bluesology &quot; ( with &quot; Bag's Groove &quot; quotes ), a Black Orpheus medley dedicated to former Tjader pianist Vince Guaraldi, the standard &quot; Body and Soul &quot; and Tjader's &quot; Theme &quot; ( based on &quot; Freddie Freeloader &quot; ). The quintet works well together. Hewitt's subtle use of the electric piano is a nice foil to Tjader's vibes and doesn't sound nearly as dated as one might expect. Tjader puts his heart and swing into the performance, sustaining tones almost on que. Each member of the quintet is also recorded much more effectively here in the large Cathedral setting ( which, unfortunately, wasn't the case for Guaraldi's bassist and drummer ). That's due to the engineering finesse of Phil Edwards, who went on to record for Concord Records. ~ AllAboutJazz\n\nSimply a great, great album! The Black Orpheus Medley won't allow you to do anything else for 20 minutes! If you weren't a fan of Braziliian music and Cal Tjader before, you will be! ~ Sean Dineen\n\nPersonnel:\nVibraphone, Timbales - Cal Tjader\nBass - Rob Fisher\nCongas - Poncho Sanchez\nDrums - Pete Riso\nElectric Piano - Lonnie Hewitt\n\nCal Tjader - Grace Cathedral Concert Tracks:\n01  I Showed Them \n02  Bluesology \n03  Black Orpheus Medley: Manha De Carnaval / Samba De Orfeu \n04  Body and Soul \n05  Theme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb505847bd94b8cac16fc76e01c6ce07fe5ff765","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Grace+Cathedral+Concert+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb505847bd94b8cac16fc76e01c6ce07fe5ff765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,80,88,71,189,148,184,202,193,111,199,110,1,198,206,7,254,95,247,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
