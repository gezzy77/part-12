The album features members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band as the backing band. It is considered by many to be Hunter's best recording.[2]  The title was dreamed up by co-producer Mick Ronson which he had planned for one of his solo albums. Hunter loved the title so much that he offered Ronson co-writing credit on the first single &quot;Just Another Night&quot; in exchange for the use of the title for the album. &quot;Just Another Night&quot; reached the Billboard Hot 100 No. 68. The album became one of Hunter's biggest sellers at the time. Later, singer Barry Manilow covered the song &quot;Ships&quot; which became a top ten hit.  In 2009 EMI released a 30th anniversary reissue of the album remastered with 5 bonus tracks on the first disc of outtakes and a second disc of live tracks recorded on the tour to support the album but previously unreleased. The reissue also came with a deluxe booklet discussing the making the album along with vintage and new interviews with Hunter.  The song &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot; (originally recorded as a single for Columbia Records and entitled &quot;England Rocks&quot; around the time of &quot;Overnight Angels&quot;) later became a hit when The Presidents of the United States re-recorded the song as the theme song to The Drew Carey Show, raising Hunter's profile and prompting the release of the album on CD.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Just Another Night\n[02] Wild East\n[03] Cleveland Rocks\n[04] Ships\n[05] When The Daylaight Comes\n[06] Life After Death\n[07] Standin' In My Light\n[08] Bastard\n[09] The Outsider\n[10] Don't Let Go (Demo)\n[11] Ships (Take 1)\n[12] When The Daylight Comes (Early Version)\n[13] Just Another Night (Early Version) (aka The Other Side Of Life)\n[14] Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:03m:24s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] F.B.I.
