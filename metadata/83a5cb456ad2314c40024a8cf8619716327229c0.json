He is best known for his work on mental causation and the mind-body problem. Key themes in his work include: a rejection of Cartesian metaphysics, the limitations of strict psychophysical identity, supervenience, and the individuation of events. Kim's work on these and other contemporary metaphysical and epistemological issues is well represented by the papers collected in Supervenience and Mind: Selected Philosophical Essays (1993).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a5cb456ad2314c40024a8cf8619716327229c0","amp;dn":"Jaegwon+Kim%27s+Philosophical+Writings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a5cb456ad2314c40024a8cf8619716327229c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,165,203,69,106,210,49,76,64,2,74,140,248,97,151,22,50,114,41,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
