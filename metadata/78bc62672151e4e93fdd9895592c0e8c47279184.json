Changes to the language and the library that accompanies it have changed that. Beginners can now learn C++ and write real applications. In this course you'll learn the important parts of C++ 11 syntax, get an introduction to the most useful parts of the Standard Library, and be challenged to write applications yourself in addition to watching someone else write and explain code.
