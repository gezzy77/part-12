I think this popularity has more to do with the flashy title than with the quality of the contents. Nevertheless, here it is so you can judge for yourself.\n\nI converted the scans to black and white and increased their contrast so they would look their best on the Sony Reader. Since the reader is unable to magnify scanned PDF files, some type of magnifying device is certainly recommended. It should be &quot;good enough&quot; for reading on a computer screen though.\n\nAny suggestions, comments, please don&amp;#039;t hesitate. This is my first try.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c56fdaba3cfcde7e23e0aee3a5b1527110d72df","amp;dn":"Japanese+for+Busy+People+I+-+Revised+3rd+Edition+-+Romanized+Ver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c56fdaba3cfcde7e23e0aee3a5b1527110d72df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,86,253,171,163,207,205,231,226,62,10,238,58,91,21,39,17,13,114,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
