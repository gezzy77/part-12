On the title track of his album Dennehy, Serengeti assumes the role of &quot;Kenny,&quot; a married man who loves Chicago Bears and Chicago White Sox with a thick Chicago accent reminiscent of Bill Swerski's Superfans. The track makes numerous references that would be well known to a Chicagoan, including the radio station WCKG, polish and Italian sausage, Tom Skilling, Mike Ditka, Dave Corzine, Portillo's Restaurants and &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle.&quot;\n\nIn an interview, Serengeti said he created Dennehy as an &quot;answer to common complaints about hip-hop&quot; and &quot;to put the fun back in hip-hop.&quot; Although the album helped him garner a large fanbase, Serengeti's other albums explore different genres of music from garage rock, electronic music, underground hip hop and experimental hip hop.\n\n\nAlbums: \n\nNoticeably Negro (2006)\nDon't Give Up (2007) (With Polyphonic)\nDennehy (Lights, Camera, Action!)\nConversations with Kenny / Legacy of Lee (2009)\nFamily and Friends (2011)\nKenny Dennis EP (2012)\n\n\nALL MP3! \n\n\nIf you like the artist, please support him. \n\n\n\n\nOther music just request.\n\n\n\n\nENJOY!
