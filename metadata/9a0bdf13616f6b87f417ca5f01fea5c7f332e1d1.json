Nanodiamonds are indispensable for polishing industrial materials (e.g. computer hard drives and read heads) and advanced ceramics (e.g. silicon carbide and gem diamond). This book is valuable for those dealing with nanodiamonds, as well as those interested in a general education of nano-sized materials.\n\n    * Diamond in the Sky\n    * The Nanodiamond Connection of Life and Consciousness\n    * Dawn of the Diamond Age\n    * Diamond Synthesis in Perspective\n    * Micron Fines and Nanodiamonds\n    * Dynamite Diamond\n    * Nanodiamond Applications\n    * Biological Applications of Diamond\n    * Amorphous Diamond as Thermionic Energy Converters\n    * Fluorinated DLC for Tribological Applications\n    * Gem Diamond Growth \n\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 260 pages\n    * Publisher: Pan Stanford Publishing (July 31, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9814241415\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9814241410","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0bdf13616f6b87f417ca5f01fea5c7f332e1d1","amp;dn":"Diamond+Nanotechnology+-+Syntheses+and+Applications%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0bdf13616f6b87f417ca5f01fea5c7f332e1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,11,223,19,97,111,107,135,244,23,202,95,1,254,165,199,243,50,225,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
