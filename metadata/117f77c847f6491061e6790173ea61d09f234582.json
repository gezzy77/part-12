MacDonald, an evolutionary psychologist, is the world's leading expert in the field of Jewish group-evolutionary strategy. The book considers all major intellectual and political movements which during the 20th century worked to undermine traditional Western culture. MacDonald argues persuasively that these movements, which were all lead by ethnically conscious Jews, are to be seen as an attempt to change Western culture in a way conducive to Jews.\n\n\nIn the final chapter of the book Professor MacDonald considers how a European ethnic activism can create a defense against this Jewish offensive. In this way the book becomes a kind of handbook on ethnic activism based on a solid foundation, an intellectual basis for a Western group-evolutionary strategy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117f77c847f6491061e6790173ea61d09f234582","amp;dn":"%5BKevin+MacDonald%5D+The+Culture+Of+Critique.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117f77c847f6491061e6790173ea61d09f234582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,127,119,200,71,246,73,16,97,230,121,1,115,234,97,208,159,35,69,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
