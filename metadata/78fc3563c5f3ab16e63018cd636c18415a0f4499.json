It's basically a zombie-movie, but surely NOT the type that George A. Romero popularized half a decade earlier with his milestone &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. The undead souls in this film are merely background characters whilst the main storyline revolves on a young woman searching for her father since he went missing in a little seaside town called Point Dune.\n\nMPEG-2\n4:3\n720x480\nNTSC\nDVD Ready\nRunning time: 1:29:34\n\nFor more public domain classics visit: iMovies.blogspot.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fc3563c5f3ab16e63018cd636c18415a0f4499","amp;dn":"Dead+People+aka+Messiah+of+Evil+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fc3563c5f3ab16e63018cd636c18415a0f4499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,252,53,99,197,243,171,22,230,48,24,205,99,108,24,65,90,15,68,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
