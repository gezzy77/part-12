Playing guitar on this album is Firewind  guitarist Gus G., and playing drums is former Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper drummer Tommy Clufetos. Scream was originally titled Soul Sucka  but Osbourne decided against it after negative feedback from fans. Ozzy has stated that this album reminds him of an &quot;Ozzy/Black Sabbath&quot; album. The first single from the album, titled &quot;Let Me Hear You Scream&quot; debuted on CSI: New York on 14 April. and has since spent 8 weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs, peaking at 7.\n\nCD: Ozzy Osbourne - Scream\n\n01.
