The series departs slightly from other police dramas in that the protagonist, Henry Crabbe, while still being an on-duty policeman (much against his will), is also the head chef of the title restaurant set in the fictional town of Middleton and county of Westershire.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61f1947e6dcc1a0381fccf0af7bedafc0b19e13","amp;dn":"Pie+In+The+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61f1947e6dcc1a0381fccf0af7bedafc0b19e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,31,25,71,230,220,193,160,56,31,204,240,175,123,237,175,192,177,158,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
