For four years, she has secretly watched her dream man from afar. Handsome police detective Mitch Lawson is way out of her league. She's a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, and there's no way a guy like Mitch would want anything to do with her. But when Mara has a leaky faucet that she can't fix, it's Mitch who comes to her rescue.\n\nMitch has been eyeing his beautiful neighbor for a long time. He jumps at the chance to help her, and soon their formerly platonic relationship gets very hot and heavy. But when Mara gets a disturbing phone call from her cousin's kids, she gets pulled back into the life she's tried so hard to leave behind. Can the hot law man convince Mara to let go of her past-and build a future with him?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad3031d7f4f6868585866e0369391f4e79ff4f51","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-+Law+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad3031d7f4f6868585866e0369391f4e79ff4f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,48,49,215,244,246,134,133,133,134,110,3,105,57,31,78,121,255,79,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
