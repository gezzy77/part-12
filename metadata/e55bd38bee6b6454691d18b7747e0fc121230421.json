But can she?\nReclusive novelist Aaron Westhaven, a man she's admired--and more--for years, has accepted Olivia Dupree's invitation to speak at a local fundraiser. But the day he's due to arrive, she gets a call summoning her to the bedside of a John Doe whose sole possession is her business card.\nCan this undeniably compelling man--survivor of an execution-style gunshot wound--really be the novelist the lonely Olivia has grown to think of as a near soul mate? If not, he can be in Shadow Falls for only one reason: to kill her.\nOlivia, too, has secrets. And discovering the truth about the man in the hospital bed means dredging up her own past--a past she's been hiding from for sixteen years.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55bd38bee6b6454691d18b7747e0fc121230421","amp;dn":"Kill+Me+Again+by+Maggie+Shayne+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55bd38bee6b6454691d18b7747e0fc121230421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,91,211,139,238,107,100,84,105,29,24,183,116,126,15,193,33,35,4,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
