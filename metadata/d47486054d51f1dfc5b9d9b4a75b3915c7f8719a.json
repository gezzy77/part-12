Each SRT file is associated with \n\na particular movie. I have 2 or more copies of some movies uploaded in different \n\nfile sizes and at different frame rates, so be careful if you decide to do any \n\ndeleting.\n\n\nMost of the SRT files in this folder are in English, but there are a few, not many, \n\nin other languages.\n\n\nThere will NOT be another folder such as this one in the future, because I now \n\ninclude SRT files in all my torrents that contain subtitles.\n\n\nIf you find any errors in spelling, etc. fix it yourself or learn to live with it, \n\nbecause I don't have time to correct hundreds of thousands of lines of text.\n\n\n\nBurtonW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47486054d51f1dfc5b9d9b4a75b3915c7f8719a","amp;dn":"SRT+files+for+my+torrents+that+have+subtitles+in+them","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47486054d51f1dfc5b9d9b4a75b3915c7f8719a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,116,134,5,77,81,241,223,197,185,217,180,167,91,57,21,199,248,113,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
