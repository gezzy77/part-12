Based on raw, pulsing, high-energy rhythm, most of John Lee HookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tunes are reminiscent of early country blues tunes, but with a modern and original twist. Hooker would spin tales and stories about being down, broke, and worn-out over tastefully polyrhythmic guitar riffs that would ebb and flow with intensity along with his stories. \nJohn Lee Hooker is perhaps one of the most recorded blues artists with sessions over the course of 5 decades. He was still active as a performer at the age of 83 until he died in 2001.\n\nTracks 1-11 Wise Fools Pub, Chicago, IL, USA , November 9, 1976 , Broadcast Date unknown\nRadio broadcast on WXRT\nRecorded by Ken Rasek for WXRT at Wise Fools Pub November 9, 1976.\nBonus tracks:\nTrack 12: Jul 15, 1983, Montreux Jazz Festival, Montreux, Switzerland\nTracks 13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 14: 1962, Basel, Switzerland, Swiss Radio Broadcast\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
