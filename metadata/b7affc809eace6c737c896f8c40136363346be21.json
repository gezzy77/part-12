This is because Johnny Depp barred it from release in North America (thus explaining the PAL source) after poor reviews at Cannes. Well, here it is. It isn't his best work (it's adapted from a novel by the way) but it isn't that bad, other than the somewhat implausible story. Hope you enjoy it.\n\nNotes:\n\n - Has been posted here before, but the only active torrent has Spanish audio, and the other (dead) torrent is an uncompressed 4GB DVD image\n\n - PAL source, but of course plays like any other MP4 file. Behold the power of tech!\n \n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7affc809eace6c737c896f8c40136363346be21","amp;dn":"The+Brave+%281997%29+PAL+DVD+706x546+H.264+AC3+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7affc809eace6c737c896f8c40136363346be21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,175,252,128,158,172,230,199,55,200,150,248,196,1,54,54,51,70,190,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
