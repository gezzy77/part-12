Step by step, we'll construct a control rig that is robust and animator-friendly. We'll learn everything from proper joint placement and techniques for correcting a joint's orientation to learning fun ways we can preserve volume as our mesh deforms and how to make our controls efficient and easy to comprehend. We'll also learn how to build some fun MEL tools that will help speed up our workflow, bringing that time back into constructing our control rigs with the best methods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e24384efd922bc0706f86938231dc123ac7d512","amp;dn":"Digital.Tutors.Character.Rigging.for.Production.in.Maya.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e24384efd922bc0706f86938231dc123ac7d512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,36,56,78,253,146,43,192,112,111,134,147,130,49,220,18,58,199,213,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
