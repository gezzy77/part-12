Emerging from Dayton, Ohio in 1959, the group was originally dubbed the Ohio Untouchables, and initially comprised singer/guitarist Robert Ward, bassist Marshall &quot;Rock&quot; Jones, saxophonist/guitarist Clarence &quot;Satch&quot; Satchell, drummer Cornelius Johnson, and trumpeter/trombonist Ralph &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Middlebrooks. In late 1961, a relative of Ward&amp;#039;s founded the Detroit, Michigan-based Lupine Records, and the group traveled north to the Motor City to back the Falcons on their hit &quot;I Found a Love&quot;; the Ohio Untouchables soon made their headlining debut with &quot;Love Is Amazing,&quot; but when Ward subsequently exited for a solo career, the group essentially disbanded.\n\nInfluenced by the funk of Sly &amp; the Family Stone, the new Ohio Players lineup made their debut with the single &quot;Pain,&quot; issued on the small local label Rubber Town Sounds; it was soon picked up for distribution by the Detroit-based Westbound label, reaching the R&amp;B Top 40 in late 1971. An LP, also titled Pain, appeared that same year, and was followed in 1972 by Pleasure, which launched the hit &quot;Funky Worm&quot;, their first number-one on the R&amp;B chart. Ecstacy appeared in 1973, and after 1974&amp;#039;s Climax, the Players signed to Mercury; the label change also heralded yet more lineup changes, with keyboardist Billy Beck replacing Morrison (who left to go solo and would later be the lead voice on the Funkadelic hit One Nation Under A Groove) and drummer Jimmy &quot;Diamond&quot; Williams taking over for Webster.\n\nAll tracks ripped Insane CBR~320\n\n01 Ohio Players - Skin Tight.mp3\n02 Ohio Players - Streakin&amp;#039; Cheek To Cheek.mp3\n03 Ohio Players - Words Of Love.mp3\n04 Ohio Players - Jive Turkey.mp3\n05 Ohio Players - Heaven Must Be Like This.mp3\n06 Ohio Players - Is Anybody Gonna Be Saved.mp3\ntracklist.nfo\n\n               7 File(s)     98,650,880 bytes\n\n\nThis is old school R&amp;B from the class of 1974.
