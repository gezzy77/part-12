Mc DÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \nThe former Mr. McDaniels was a clean-cut soul singer in the mold of Jackie Wilson that enjoyed minor commercial success in the early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s; the reinvented Reverend posited himself as a fervent voice of protest, recording a pair of now-classic records for Atlantic in 1970 and 1971, Ã¢â‚¬Å“OutlawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Headless Heroes of the ApocalypseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \nBut where many other artists dabbled in the counterculture to explore different ways of presenting their image or to take advantage of looser codes of moral conduct, McDaniels fully embraced the movementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radical politics - so much so that then-Vice President Spiro Agnew allegedly called Atlantic to issue a verbal cease-and-desist order upon the release of his second record (Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse) for the label.\n Headless Heroes was quite revelatory, for its jazzy soul vibes had been a source of significant hip-hop samples (Pete Rock, A Tribe Called Quest, Organized Konfusion) whose original sources were only heard by a fortunate few cratediggers. Outlaw, on the other hand, is an entirely different breed of soul: more rock-influenced, more overtly political, and truly beyond comparison with any of its contemporaries.\n As on Headless Heroes, McDaniels recorded Outlaw with a rock- (and jazz-) solid band that featured legendary jazz bassists Ron Carter and Miroslav Vitous, ubiquitous Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s session guitarist Hugh McCracken and Alphonse Mouzon on drums - a group that fleshed out the RevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hippie-folk-funky dreams with undaunted restraint. The band is largely responsible for the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pure cohesiveness, as they bring McDanielsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disparate styles together into one of the most powerfully lasting statements of post-Aquarian Age culture.\n This is soul. Not Al Green soul. Not Isaac Hayes soul (but perhaps a bit closer to that). This is the soul of the black man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d46479b5595b695fae4c0eb9ac382ce89c8d5185","amp;dn":"Eugene+McDaniels+-+Outlaw+1970+%26amp%3B+Headless+Heroes+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d46479b5595b695fae4c0eb9ac382ce89c8d5185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,100,121,181,89,91,105,95,174,76,14,185,172,56,44,232,156,141,81,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
