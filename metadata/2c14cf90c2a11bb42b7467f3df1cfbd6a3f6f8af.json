All work done by VIruz.\n\n----\n\nSummary:\nCamera block has been added - now you can see what is happening on different locations. Camera rotation and controlling ships through cameras will be added in the coming weeks. Additional workshop tags for mods have been introduced to make the orientation on workshop easier. It is also possible to make better production building mods. Now you can specify what blueprints are available to production building. It's possible to make production chains and production building tiers. As an example there's a new block 'Arc FurnaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, it is specialized building for iron ore refinement. It refines faster than refinery, it's more efficient and cheaper, but cannot refine anything other than iron ore. In addition to these new changes, we have redesigned the easy start 2 map, and rebalanced the cargo ships, adding new space engineers tech to them both. We have also made it possible to create a hostile identity in your world whilst in creative, this will allow people to make maps for others to play through, with the challenge of hostile ships and stations. Finally, render interpolation has been added as well that will make the game experience smoother. It is currently disabled by default since it is not completed 100%, but it can be turned on in video options.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Camera block\n- Workshop tags for mods\n- better production building Modding\n- Ã¢â‚¬ËœArc FurnaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (refinery)\n- Easy start 2 redesign\n- Cargo ship redesigns\n- Add enemy identity\n\nFixes:\n- improved rendering performance of solar panels\n- improved rendering performance of refinery and assembler\n- fixed hacked block getting shot by own turrets\n- fixed connectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s issue not being able to collect all items\n- fixed ship info screen labels\n- fixed issue that player cannot remove blocks from cockpit hot-bars 2, 3 and 4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c14cf90c2a11bb42b7467f3df1cfbd6a3f6f8af","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.045.011+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c14cf90c2a11bb42b7467f3df1cfbd6a3f6f8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,20,207,144,194,161,27,180,43,116,103,243,223,28,251,214,163,246,248,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
