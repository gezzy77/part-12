They don't sugar coat it by stranding them on an island, or making them pretend they want to love somebody. They're there for the cash and the women look GREAT!!!  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/shows/i_love_money/season_1/series.jhtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vh1.com/shows/i_love_money/season_1/series.jhtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOver the past two years 100 young men and women competed on five record-breaking VH1 shows (&quot;Flavor of Love: Seasons 1 &amp; 2&quot;, &quot;I Love New York: Seasons 1 &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Rock of Love&quot;) in a quest to find true love. But were they really looking for love? \n\nVH1 and 51 Minds Entertainment present the new television series &quot;I Love Money&quot;. It's a show that gives 15 wildly popular All-Star cast members from the &quot;of Love&quot; series, the chance to battle it out for what they really wanted all along -- fame -- and even more importantly -- money. Last time these cast members competed it was for the heart of Bret Michaels or Flavor Flav, but on &quot;I Love Money&quot; the stakes are arguably higher - and definitely &quot;greener&quot; -- the winner is walking away with $250,000! \n\nThe cast (made up of favorites like Hottie, Mr. Boston, Pumkin, 12 Pack, Smiley) will pack their bags and head to an exotic, tropical location in Mexico where they will live during the ten episode series. Once moved in, the cast will meet their host Craig Jackson (X-show, 30 Seconds to Fame) and start the competition! Each hour-long episode will include an outrageous challenge (inspired by the most famous and iconic moments from the &quot;of Love&quot; shows), exciting rewards and suspense-filled eliminations. A Survivor-esque spin on the &quot;of Love&quot; format gives a single cast member each week the power of deciding who goes home. It will be a cutthroat competition as cast members sharpen their backstabbing skills in the fight for their fortune. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kansasmetalscene.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kansasmetalscene.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf4a5ea91581a504edbdccab56906a4eb590c2f","amp;dn":"I+Love+Money+Season+1+www.kansasmetalscene.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf4a5ea91581a504edbdccab56906a4eb590c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,244,165,234,145,88,26,80,78,219,220,202,181,105,6,164,235,89,12,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
