It's an enjoyable little film involving many people saying funny things on their cell phones in New York. Not only is it funny, but it's Woody's first good film since &quot;Everyone Says I Love You.&quot; Look fast for Tony Roberts.\n\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 2mn 56s\nBit rate                                 : 2 344 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\n\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\n\nLanguage: english\nSubtitles: spanish and portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e37069e3de74e2704112d53bfaf4f0221483260","amp;dn":"Sounds+from+a+Town+I+Love+%282001%2C+Woody+Allen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e37069e3de74e2704112d53bfaf4f0221483260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,55,6,158,61,231,78,39,4,17,45,83,191,175,79,2,33,72,50,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
