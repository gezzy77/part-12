Set against the backdrop of a sultry countryside near the French Alps, three motherless brothers collectively face the challenges of adulthood. There is Marc (Nicolas Cazale), a burgeoning criminal; Christophe (Stephane Rideau, Come Undone), who is trying to re-start his life after prison; and Olivier (Thomas Dumarchez), a capoeira fighter in love. As the young brothers wrestle with their transitions into manhood, they must each escape the tyrannical rule of their father to carve out their own places in life. Stunning cinematography and powerful performances help make Three Dancing Slaves an erotic, breathtaking film about family and the struggle of making your mark on the world around you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4198e46c48596fb93c97e04691004d2b04f8ae1c","amp;dn":"Le+Clan+%28Three+dancing+slaves%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4198e46c48596fb93c97e04691004d2b04f8ae1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,152,228,108,72,89,111,185,60,151,224,70,145,0,77,43,4,248,174,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
