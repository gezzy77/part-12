Daniel, Paul Pope, Walter Simonson, Art Baltazar and others - but will any of them measure up to the exacting standards of the Clown Princess of Crime? Don't miss the thrilling return of Harley Quinn in her own monthly series!\n\nWritten by: Amanda Conner, Jimmy Palmiotti\nArt by: Darwyn Cooke, Sam Kieth, Tony S. Daniel, Paul Pope, Walter Simonson, Art Baltazar\nCover by: Amanda Conner\nVariant Cover by: Stephane Roux\n\nColor, 32 Pages\nU.S. Price: 2.99\nOn Sale: November 20, 2013\n\n------\n\nSOME SPOILERS BELOW!!!\n\nFrom Inside Pulse:\n\nDC Comics had initiated a tryout art contest for page #15 of Harley Quinn #0.\n\nDue to the page's fourth / last panel on the script Ã¢â‚¬â€œ featuring a nude bathtub bound Harley Quinn appearing to commit suicide Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a controversy erupted which had Suicide Prevention groups up in arms. Comic book creators also chimed in on whether such a panel would have been created for a male character.\n\nThis brouhaha, as reported in USA Today, caused DC Comics to distance itself from the suicide (mis)interpretation as the book's co-writer Jimmy Palmiotti clarified that the panel in question was intended to be slapstick in a MAD magazine style.\n\nHarley Quinn #0 came out today and the fourth panel to the page 15 art tryout page has been changed. More on that in a moment.\n\nDC Comics' online tryout art contest information is no longer available on their website.\n\nSpoilers for Harley Quinn #0 follows.\n\nJeremy Roberts won the art panel contest and the fourth panel was replaced with Harley Quinn, um, riding a rocket; a very phallic rocket. I get that the panel is intended to be whimsical, but I imagine some readers will see a sexist suicide panel replaced with a simply a sexist panel. Jimmy Palmiotti is one my favorite writers in comics and I think we should move on from this tryout page controversy. And, I have to say, I'd love to see more art from Jeremy Roberts.\n\nMoving past the tryout page / panel controversy, the book seemingly ends with new Harley Quinn series artist Chad Hardin on two pages that set up Harley Quinn #1. They are art imitating art pages and set up a potentially interesting new status quo for Harley.\n\nHarley reads the comic book before her cliffhanger panel happens. Plus Harley Quinn, landlord? A sitcom-like premise next month? We'll see. Who is Harley's mysterious benefactor?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a51530763d247a7efe5c9ee7ad490bf2baccd8d","amp;dn":"HARLEY+QUINN+000+%282014%29+%28DC+The+New+52%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a51530763d247a7efe5c9ee7ad490bf2baccd8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,81,83,7,99,210,71,167,239,229,201,238,122,212,144,191,43,172,205,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
