This file will provide you with the &quot;Mac way' - easy plug and play.\n\nPixologic has achieved new breakthroughs with the release of ZBrush 4. Through the introduction of completely new tools and the extension or expansion of existing ZBrush utilities.\n \nZBrush 4 sets a new standard for digital art software. ZBrush 4 offers the freedom to explore and create; take your art from concept to final production asset without the need to leave the ZBrush environment.\n \nYou can also use GoZ to seamlessly transition between ZBrush and other applications.\n\nWith this release, ZBrush continues to evolve in the directions established by the innovations of ZBrush 3.5.\n \nBuilding on the desire to add more intuitive modeling tools such as ZBrush 3.5's QuickSketch, ZSketch and Remesh, version 4 adds ShadowBox, Clip Brushes, and improved SubTools.\n \nHard surface sculpting is now just as easy and powerful as organic modeling. \nWith ZBrush 4 you can create vehicles just as fluidly as creatures, environments or characters.\n \nSculpt anything you can imagine and then paint your work with the SpotLight PolyPainting projection system. Export your work for 3D printing so that you can hold your creation in your hand!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Your 3D creations are only as good as their presentation. Now ZBrush 4 includes an animation timeline allowing you to create moving turntables for your demo reel.\n \nAnimate poses, store camera positions, sync your animation to music, import audio to test blend shapes and lip sync -- all within ZBrush. \n\nMore than simply an animation tool, the timeline can also be used to store and switch between your model's states for fast, easy control while working. \nShow your model off in the best light by using the new Best Preview render options to add amazing realism: Render subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, fibers, advanced shadows and more in no time!\n\nNew Features:\n\n* Posable Symmetry\n\n* TransPose with topology masking\n\n* HD Geometry\n\n* SubTools with Project All, GroupSplit and Extract\n\n* 3D Layers\n\n* MatCap\n\n* Brush Palette with Many new brushes, Mesh Insert, Alpha Tiling and\n  Wrap Mode, Gravity, Cavity Masking, Backface Masking and Color\n  Masking\n\n* PolyPaint with or without UV's: Real-time painting on the model\n\n* Perspective while editing models\n\n* Real-time Preview Shadows\n\n* New Masking Options:Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Blur and Sharpen\n\n* Most stroke types can be used with any sculpting brush, Lazy Mouse\n  and Roll Mode\n\n* Make 3D\n\n* Disable/Enable UV's, Switch U&lt;&gt;V, Cycle UV\n\n* Movie creator with turntable capability and Quicktime export\n\n* Tool Palette with a new organization of the pop-up window, new icons\n  for the non-3D brushes\n\n* Interface Customization with Custom Palettes and Menus, Wide or\n  Narrow Buttons, Scalable Buttons, Gradient Canvas Background, \n  Custom Hotkeys, Macros, Alpha, Material and Texture pre-loads, \n  Color presets with easy selection buttons in the title bar and Title bar buttons for rotating between interface layouts\n\n* Preferences Palette with Import material zones as polygroups, Group\n  NSided Polygons and Support for over 100 processors/cores\n\nGo to : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.pixologic.com/zclassroom/homeroom/tutorial.php?lesson=beginner&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.pixologic.com/zclassroom/homeroom/tutorial.php?lesson=beginner&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfor help and tutorials\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac X.5.8 or higher\n2GB RAM (min)\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ddef75c400779a32042efaa3487b4b43aad9f3d","amp;dn":"ZBrush+4.0+pre%5BK%5Dracked++%2B+ref+manuals+for+version+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ddef75c400779a32042efaa3487b4b43aad9f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,222,247,92,64,7,121,163,32,66,239,170,52,135,180,180,58,173,159,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
