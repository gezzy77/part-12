He holds forth in his typical blunt, anti-intellectual style on a range of topics including the Rolling Stones, Fidel Castro and 9/11 conspiracy theories. His diatribes are loosely linked to a travelogue as Ventura and his wife drive to Baja California in their truck-camper. Excerpts from interviews and his wife's diaries provide a welcome break from Ventura's boorish tone (although his anecdotesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½particularly one involving the Dalai Lama and the film CaddyshackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are occasionally amusing). The book concludes with Ventura combining his three passions: wrestling, politics and self-adulation when he imagines running for President on a WWE ticket. Whether the reader will find that a horrifying fantasy or a hilarious one will largely determine how they feel about this book.\n\nAbout the Author\nJesse Ventura is the former governor of Minnesota and author of several bestselling books, including DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Start the Revolution Without Me! and American Conspiracies.
