Seeders are needed for this one, it's a big 'un!\n\nMake sure to watch the video link, because it details how to configure for your preferences (i.e. some stuff won't work unless you configure)\n\nOkay, so instead of all those people out there trying to get Mac OS X Lion running under Windows properly, I've prebuilt an image (which works like 100%) for you all to use instead :) Just run the .exe and it'll self extract and open the VM in VMware (or whatever you use). \n\nOh yeah, and this is Mac OS X Lion 10.7. When every new build of Mac comes out I think I'm gonna upload a new image. But you guys have nothing to worry about with Apple Software Updates, go right ahead and do it! I SHOULD have got it sorted enough, but comment any bugs you run into on the torrent :)\n\nOh, and one last thing. There isn't a default password set, but you can add one by going to Preferences&gt;Accounts.\n\nSubscribe on Youtube? Maybe click a few adds to grab me some cash? :P\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f0dfc7ca7223a78c5c7ee755f08bcedeb42053","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Lion+VMware+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f0dfc7ca7223a78c5c7ee755f08bcedeb42053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,240,223,199,202,114,35,167,140,92,126,231,85,240,139,206,222,180,32,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
