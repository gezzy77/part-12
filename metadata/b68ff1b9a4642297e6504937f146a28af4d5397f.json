Many versed in European history may only have a vague understanding of the Byzantines and their Christian empire. They were the inheritors of the knowledge and literature of ancient world and passed it on to the Arab, Slav, and Turkish peoples. They carried the spark from the ancient Greeks and Romans back to Europe helping to start the Rennaissance. Their influence on the development of national Orthodox Christain churches in Russia and the Balkans is also highlighted. This is a book full of wonderful photos and illustrations that show why the Byzantines set the standard for civilization and culture across Europe and the Middle East for a millenium. It serves as a great jumping off place for learning about the Byzantines.\n\n G.
