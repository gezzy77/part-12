Wagner gives each character a great inner monologue that explores just who they are and how they fit in the world - and, indeed, what they think of each other. A critical and commercial success, Trinity paved the way for an lengthy follow-up series in 2008. These are digital copies of the three issues thanks to Minutemen-PhD; there are copies by Zone-Empire as well but I thought these were pretty great as it is. Thanks to the scanners, and please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9868d1dbc39313bab8a6759f41a0669810f1dba9","amp;dn":"Batman%7CSuperman%7CWonder+Woman%3A+Trinity+01-03+%282003%7CDgtl%7CMM-PhD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9868d1dbc39313bab8a6759f41a0669810f1dba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,104,209,219,195,147,19,186,184,166,117,159,65,160,102,152,16,241,219,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
