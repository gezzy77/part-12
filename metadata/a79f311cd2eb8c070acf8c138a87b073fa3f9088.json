This sleek, highly refined pocket computer comes with everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€cellphone, iPod, Internet, camcorderÃ¢â‚¬â€except a printed manual. Fortunately, David Pogue is back with this expanded edition of his witty, full-color guide: the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular iPhone book.\n\nThe important stuff you need to know:\n\n- The iPhone 5. This book unearths all the secrets of the newest iPhone. Taller screen, faster chip, 4G LTE Internet, thinner than ever.\n- The iOS 6 software. Older iPhones gain Do Not Disturb, the new Maps app, shared Photo Streams, camera panoramas, smarter Siri, and about 197 more new features. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here.\n- The apps. That catalog of 750,000 add-on programs makes the iPhoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phone features almost secondary. Now youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know how to find, manage, and exploit those apps.\n\nThe iPhone may be the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coolest computer, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a computer, with all of a computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complexities. iPhone: The Missing Manual is a funny, gorgeously illustrated guide to the tips, shortcuts, and workarounds that will turn you, too, into an iPhone addict.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: The iPhone as Phone\nChapter 1.
