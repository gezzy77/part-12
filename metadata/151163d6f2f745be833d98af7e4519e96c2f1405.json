We then mixed it once with Glyn Johns whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d done a very straightforward mix, very plain, but I loved it. Alan Klein was around by this time and he sort of said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think it's good enoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He pulled in Phil Spector to try and sort of help Ã¢â‚¬Å“reproduceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ it as it said on the record.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Paul McCartney- Let It Be Album Mini Documentary, 2009 Beatle Remasters DVD\n\n  I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be the first person to have done an assembly like this. I just havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet come across any other examples.\n\n  Despite having been a Beatle fan since the age of 11, and having heard my share of alternate Beatle recordings over the years, including some Let It Be material, it was a memory that resurfaced of a friend getting a vinyl copy of the Glyn Johns Ã¢â‚¬Å“Get Back AlbumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ years before that finally led me to seek out the recordings in March of 2011. My early and continuing dissatisfaction with the Let It Be album obviously meant that I was primed for these tracks; when I finally heard them I was quite honestly blown away. Wonderful mixes of performances that were intimate, bluesy and fun; to me most of them (12 to be exact) were nothing less than the components of a long lost and desperately needed alternate to the oh so Ã¢â‚¬Å“reproducedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Let It Be album.\n  \n  Of course they were badly in need of sequencing (the source obviously being a collection of mixes for review, not an assembled, completed album), and some editing (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hope we passed the auditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ following One After 909? Sorry Glyn, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think so). A little sequencing, a little editing, that was the original idea. So here we are a year later and despite what some of my friends may think, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m finally ready to stop fiddling with my little assembled-from-spare-parts FrankensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monster.*\n\n The release of the bootleg Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kum BackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1969 means that many fans may have been familiar with these tracks for decades. Perhaps in this new running order and the digital sharpness in which these tracks are now available the longtime fan might still find something new to enjoy.\n\n  *Addendum: After posting this on March 23rd (2012), I gradually became aware of several rough bits (mostly segues) that still needed some smoothing. The only obvious changes (at least to those not using headphones) are the 5 March, 1963 studio chatter added to the start of Revolution 909, extended chatter following Get Back (track 4), and the addition of the new track 28, The Third Man Theme, bringing the total to 31 tracks . I have also taken the opportunity to continue to refine these liner notes. 7/13/12\n\n The only rule I followed was to use any tracks in any way that I felt served the album. And as I found more tracks to add, a structure seemed to reveal itself, not just of the album that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released but also the movie that Michael Lindsay-Hogg didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make. The one featuring the world weary pop superstars whose very popularity had denied them the joy of live performance. Who having become song writers, recording artists and studio musicians of great\nsuccess realized just how much they missed the joy of just playing together as a band. So for their next project they resolved to do just that, and while playing together hour after hour working out their new songs they naturally revisit the tunes of their younger days. The days of gigs and early recording dates and always playing as a band. The days of Hamburg, Liverpool and all the dancehalls, and a young band working their way up and having so much fun doing it. Get Back indeed.\n\n1. Revolution 909 1:48\n2. One After 909 3.18\n3. Dig A Pony 4:04\n4. Get Back 4:06\n5. The Long And Winding Road 3:36\n6. Rocker :44\n7. Maggie Mae :56\n8.
