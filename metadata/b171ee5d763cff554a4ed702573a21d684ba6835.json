Series one\n\nIn early 1998, Lee &amp; Herring made a surprise return to BBC2 screens in &quot;This Morning With Richard Not Judy&quot;, a live 45 minute show that would air on Sunday lunchtimes. It was based loosely on a show of the same name that the pair had performed at the Edinburgh Festival in previous years, the origins of which actually go as far back as a Richard Herring solo show from the Festival in 1994.\nThe show introduced new characters to the Lee &amp; Herring universe, (such as &quot;The Curious Orange&quot; &amp; &quot;The Organ Gang&quot;), visualized old radio sketches (&quot;Histor&amp;#039;s Eye&quot;), and extended work from previous shows (&quot;The Two Very Different Teachers&quot; sketch from Fist Of Fun returned in a regular slot over the latter half of the series). \n\nThis Morning With Richard Not Judy (TMWRNJ) managed to successfully combine the wonderful live atmosphere that Lee &amp; Herring had managed to capture so well in their radio shows with the tightly scripted sketches from Fist Of Fun. However, it wasn&amp;#039;t the runaway success it could (should?) have been.\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 1.wmv\nFile Size: 79.9 MB (83,882,138 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 miins 33 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 15/02/1998\t\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 2.wmv\nFile Size: 78.8 MB (82,720,964 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 00 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 22/02/1998\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 3.wmv\nFile Size: 78.7 MB (82,628,542 bytes)\nRuntime: 43 mins 59 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 01/03/1998\t\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 4.wmv\nFile Size: 78.8 MB (82,732,528 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 02 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 08/03/1998\n\t\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 5.wmv\nFile Size: 78.9 MB (82,823,500 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 02 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 15/03/1998\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 6.wmv\nFile Size: 79.0 MB (82,891,380 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 04 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 22/03/1998\t\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 7.wmv\nFile Size: 79.0 MB (82,897,156 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 04 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 29/03/1998\n\nFile Name: TMWRNJ Series 1 Episode 8.wmv\nFile Size: 78.9 MB (82,751,306 bytes)\nRuntime: 44 mins 03 seconds\nVideo Codec Name: WMV\nVideo Bitrate:  256kbps\nResolution: 320 x 240 pixels\nBROADCAST 05/04/1998\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b171ee5d763cff554a4ed702573a21d684ba6835","amp;dn":"THIS+MORNING+WITH+RICHARD+NOT+JUDY+-+SERIES+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b171ee5d763cff554a4ed702573a21d684ba6835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,113,238,93,118,60,255,85,74,78,215,2,87,58,33,214,132,186,104,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
