It\\&amp;#039;s the incredible true store of one of the world\\&amp;#039;s most fascinating leaders - Tibet\\&amp;#039;s Dalai Lama - and his daring struggle to rule a nation at one o fthe most challenging times in its history.  Powerfully told and set against a backdrop of world politics - the film\\&amp;#039;s release created an international uproar!  Featuring a striking, Oscar - nominated score by renowned composer Philip Glass, this extraordinary motion picture has been greeted with both controversy and worldwide acclaim - experience it for yourself.\n\n------\n7 years in Tibet is somewhat of an Americanized version of this production, both with their basis in a book of the Dalai Lama\\&amp;#039;s earlier years.  Watch this for a more accurate telling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3de04064515365ab6cadf436974229237976ef8","amp;dn":"Kundun+%281997%29+-+a+Martin+Scorsese+Picture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3de04064515365ab6cadf436974229237976ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,222,4,6,69,21,54,90,182,202,223,67,105,116,34,146,55,151,110,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
