The integration enables developers to quickly set up a complete PHP environment and speed up root cause analysis[1] of problems detected in testing or in the production environment.\nZend Studio is also integrated with Zend Framework. For example, it provides an MVC view for easy code navigation and integration with Zend_Tool for automated code generation.[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a711779121ccdcd7eb745618d776d0c5ab7d85","amp;dn":"Zend.Studio.v10.0.20130211.Incl.KeyMaker.and.Patch-DVT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a711779121ccdcd7eb745618d776d0c5ab7d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,167,17,119,145,33,204,220,215,235,116,86,24,215,118,208,197,171,125,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
