Gunderson,\nFBI Senior Special Agent In Charge (Ret) \n\nHonorable Lawmakers, Guardians of the United States Constitution and the Federal Treasury,\n\nI am a licensed private investigator with more than 54 years experience. This includes more than 27 years as a special agent with the FBI. At the time of my retirement on March 30, 1979, I was in charge of the FBI LOS ANGELES Division, which included most of Southern California. I had more than 700 personnel under my command, with a budget of 22.5 Million Dollars. \n\nAs a licensed private investigator I have specialized in exposing graft, corruption, and illegal, criminal activity involving public officials. The tentacles of these investigations have involved public officials at all levels of government: city, county, state and federal, and have reached as high as the White House. Most disturbing of all I have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchiseled in stoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ documentation of an international criminal enterprise involving kidnapping, murders, including human sacrifices by Satanic Cults, and other nefarious criminal activity on the part of public officials and leading citizens in various communities. Specifically, in regards to Child Protective Services in some areas and some states, I have been told by a reliable source, that a planeload of 210 children from CPS was flown out of Denver, Colorado on November 6, 1997 to Paris, France. Later a second plane of children also under the care of CPS was flown from Los Angeles to Europe. I have also developed information through credible and reliable sources that in the past, children have been taken from Foster Homes, orphanages, and Boys Town Nebraska, and flown by private jets from Sioux City Iowa to Washington D.C. for sex orgies with politicians. \n\nI have interviewed witnesses who were active in an international child-kidnapping ring, who advised me that, of the thousands of children who disappear every year, many are auctioned off, at various locations throughout the country. This kidnapping ring involves a case under investigation known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Franklin Cover Up.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nOne of my sources advised that he has attended six such auctions, with six to thirty six children being auctioned off. These locations are identified as fifty miles outside Las Vegas, Nevada, Toronto Canada, Houston Texas, an unidentified location in Michigan and a barn outside Lincoln Nebraska. \n\nThis source informed me that the children range in age from 2-21, both boys and girls. They are usually placed on a stage or platform, in their underwear with a number attached to a string around their necks. The perpetrators bid on the children by number. The location outside Las Vegas was at a small airport. Some of the children were auctioned off to foreigners wearing turbans on their heads. The children were placed in private planes from which they took off. Other children were placed in campers. They were drugged so that if police stopped them the kidnappers could claim their child was sleeping. This same source advised me that when he was ten years old he was used as decoy in public places to attract other children his age to that area, where the adults would grab the kids and flee. This source also informed me that in his early teens he made more than 100 trips around the world transporting drugs. Often he would be given instructions to fly to a city where he would be met by a strange couple, who would have 5-6 different passports from different countries with different names for three of them, for the purpose of making drug drops. \n\nIn the early 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, following the circulation of &quot;The Franklin Cover-up&quot; for almost a year, the Yorkshire Television of England sent a topnotch investigatory team to produce a documentary on the Franklin Cover Up. They conducted a national investigation for 10 months, interviewing, filming, and documenting the Franklin story, finding new witnesses, and uncovering new evidence. Their documentary, &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; was scheduled to be aired nationwide on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994 at 10 PM. It was listed in the national publication, &quot;TV Guide&quot;. When certain members of congress learned that Conspiracy of Silence was to be aired on national TV, the cable industry was threatened with restrictive legislation, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown parties and all copies were ordered destroyed. It never aired. \n\nApproximately six months ago I ordered a copy of the TV Guide for May 3, 1994. Even though Conspiracy of Silence had been listed for this date in a previous issue, the most recent issue of TV GUIDE, listed a documentary on Nature in itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ place. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apparent the TV GUIDE for this date was reprinted. I then visited the LA TIMES LIBRARY, reviewed the TV log for May 3, 1994 noted that Conspiracy of Silence was listed to be aired on that date at 10 PM. I had a contact on the East Coast review the TV log for the PHILADELPHIA ENQUIRER and noted Conspiracy of Silence was also listed in their TV log section at 10 PM, May 3, 1994. I have a bootleg copy of this documentary, which is available: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=866739408240639313#\n\nI developed information from a credible source in a major city in Southwest U.S. that there is collusion between judges, attorneys and underworld criminals. Children in the system, are adopted, four thousand dollars is given to the people who adopt, and the childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s names are changed and each child is re-adopted up to 75 times, with four thousand dollars going to each adoption every time. The Federal Government Adoption Bonus is given to these judges, attorneys and underworld criminals it is split among the three groups of child traffickers. \n\nAs an outgrowth of my involvement in the Franklin Cover Up Case from Omaha, I learned that a covert CIA operation known as the Finders based in Washington D.C. which was actively involved in kidnapping and international trafficking of children since the early 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. This matter was brought to the attention of the FBI and State Department in February 1997. A report by the Metropolitan Police Department was classified ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSecretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the interest of National Security. The investigation by the FBI was closed down, however according to a US CUSTOMS investigative report, portions of which I will now read, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Finders became a CIA internal matter.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ I have given this information to the FBI on seven occasions, and have demanded an investigation for the international kidnapping and trafficking of children. \n\nLet me read directly from the US CUSTOMS REPORT ABOUT THE FINDERSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nI have been involved for several years with a case involving what appears to be corruption by Child Protective Services in the State of Colorado. Furthermore there has been a total lack of consideration or follow up to investigate these matters in both states of Colorado or California. It is alarming that there is a similarity between the CPS Colorado Case and the Finders of Washington D.C. with the specific reference to a nanny placed in the home. \n\nI have personally written to the authorities in Colorado regarding this case and have had no response. The case involves an adoptive womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s children being given to her nanny, and you will hear this case from her next. \n\nI appreciate the opportunity for being able to bring this to your attention. There is nothing more important than protecting our children. Thank you, very much. \n\nRespectfully Presented By\n\nTHEODORE L. GUNDERSON\n\n\n\n[img=http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae194/geogaddi00/John-de-Camp-Letter-WEB.jpg]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44506bad1275d2c7f589eeeb71555106ccb4a15","amp;dn":"Ted+Gunderson+-+CIA-Sponsored+Child+Prostitution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44506bad1275d2c7f589eeeb71555106ccb4a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,69,6,186,209,39,93,44,127,88,158,238,183,21,85,16,108,203,74,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
