Inspired by classic 1950s B-monster movies and directed by Sean S. Cunningham (director of the original FRIDAY THE 13TH), DEEPSTAR SIX is a watery nod to the man versus monster genre.\n\nCredits \nCast: Taurean Blacque \nDirector: Sean Cunningham \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6b824a4fb872def27889291b56f4fa9ab04160","amp;dn":"Deep+Star+Six","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6b824a4fb872def27889291b56f4fa9ab04160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,107,130,74,79,184,114,222,242,120,137,41,27,86,244,250,154,176,65,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
