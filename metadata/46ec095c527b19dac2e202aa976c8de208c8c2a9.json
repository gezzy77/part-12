Based on freely written material probably composed by Ockeghem himself, and consisting entirely of mensuration canons[1], it has been called &quot;perhaps the most extraordinary contrapuntal achievement of the fifteenth century&quot;, and was possibly the first multi-part work to be written which used a unifying canonic principle all its movements\n\nThe mass is for four voices, and is in the usual parts:\n\n   1.
