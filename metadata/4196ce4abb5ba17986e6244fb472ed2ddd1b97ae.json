Numerous revisions were needed, highlighting the dramatic\ncontinuing progress in the drug sciences. In particular, it appeared necessary to include\nnovel therapeutic principles, such as the inhibitors of platelet aggregation\nfrom the group of integrin GPIIB/IIIA antagonists, the inhibitors of viral protease, or\nthe non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. Moreover, the re-evaluation\nand expanded use of conventional drugs, e.g., in congestive heart failure, bronchial\nasthma, or rheumatoid arthritis, had to be addressed. In each instance, the primary\nemphasis was placed on essential sites of action and basic pharmacological principles.\nDetails and individual drug properties were deliberately omitted in the interest\nof making drug action more transparent and affording an overview of the pharmacological\nbasis of drug therapy.\nThe authors wish to reiterate that the Color Atlas of Pharmacology cannot replace a\ntextbook of pharmacology, nor does it aim to do so. Rather, this little book is designed\nto arouse the curiosity of the pharmacological novice; to help students of medicine\nand pharmacy gain an overview of the discipline and to review certain bits of\ninformation in a concise format; and, finally, to enable the experienced therapist to\nrecall certain factual data, with perhaps some occasional amusement.\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a3ced6cbc2cecec2c78dd4c2d2c2d18dc2c1c1c2d0e3cfcad5c68dc0ccce&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4196ce4abb5ba17986e6244fb472ed2ddd1b97ae","amp;dn":"Colour+Atlas+Of+Pharmacology+2nd+Ed.+%28thieme+2000%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4196ce4abb5ba17986e6244fb472ed2ddd1b97ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,150,206,74,187,91,161,121,134,230,36,79,180,114,237,45,221,27,151,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
