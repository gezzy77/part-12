The capabilities of each technology in making sub-100nm structures are described. The limits of preventing a technology from further going down the dimensional scale are analyzed.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples, Zheng Cui covers state-of-the art technologies in nanofabrication including:\r\n\r\nPhoton-based lithography\r\nCharged particle beams lithography\r\nNanofabrication using scanning probes\r\nNanoscale replication\r\nNanoscale pattern transfer\r\nIndirect nanofabrication\r\nNanofabrication by self-assembly\r\nNanofabrication: Principles, Capabilities and Limits will serve as a practical guide and first-hand reference for researchers and practitioners working in nanostructure fabrication and also provides a &quot;tool box&quot; of various techniques that can be easily adapted in different fields of applications.\r\n\r\nWritten for: Nanoscience and nanotechnology researchers and engineers, technical professionals and academic researchers in the fields of electrtonics, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce544a1da72c24a812135099d777b2408520e5d","amp;dn":"Nanofabrication+Principles%2C+Capabilities+and+Limits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce544a1da72c24a812135099d777b2408520e5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,229,68,161,218,114,194,74,129,33,53,9,157,119,123,36,8,82,14,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
