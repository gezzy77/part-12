Used in Vietnam for troop transport with the attachable palletised container and downed-aircraft retrieval with the sling-load system, it was highly successful.\n \nThe Skycrane can not only hold its cargo up and tight against its center spine to lessen drag and eliminate the pendulum effect when flying forward, it can winch vehicles up and down from a hovering position. After the Heavy Lift Helicopter program was cancelled the Skycranes remained in U.S. National Guard service until the early 1990s.\n\n \nToday Erickson Air-Crane operates the largest fleet of this helicopter in the world under the name Erickson S-64E Aircrane which can be equipped with water-dropping equipment for firefighting duties. After obtaining the type certificate and manufacturing rights in 1992 Erickson Air-Crane remains the manufacturer and worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest operator of S-64s.\n \n \n \nThis addon represents both the CH-54A Tarhe and the Erickson S-64E Aircrane variants.\n \nThis addon requires Acceleration Expansion Pack for FSX preinstalled.\n \n \n \nFeatures:\n --Accurate and detailed interior and exterior visual models\n --Custom exterior and interior animations\n --HD textures\n --Fully clickable dynamic virtual cockpit with 3D instruments\n --Perfectly flyable from the VC\n --Realistic flight dynamics\n --Two different versions for both variants\n --Working water-dropping system\n --Working sling-load system\n --PDF manual\n\nLesson of the Day: This is your ass (_._) This is your ass in prison (_O_) .
