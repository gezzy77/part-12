Bringing to light the harmful effects of evolutionary thought on the Church, and society in general, this team of veteran creationists shows readers in shocking detail how Darwin started us down the slippery slope.\nThe book was put together by six popular Biblical creationist authors and lecturers. Each author has written one chapter in this book that deals with the rapid decline of Christianity, morals, ethics, and values in our world and American society.\n\nAbout the authors:\nKen Ham is the president/CEO and founder of Answers in Genesis - U.S. and the highly acclaimed Creation Museum. Ken Ham is one of the most in-demand Christian speakers in North America. Ken's emphasis is on the relevance and authority of the book of Genesis and how compromise on Genesis has opened a dangerous door regarding how the culture and church view biblical authority. His Australian accent, keen sense of humor, captivating stories, and exceptional PowerPoint illustrations have made him one of North America's most effective Christian communicators.\n\nJohn Morris, Ph.D. , is president of the Institute for Creation Research in El Cajon, California and has a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Oklahoma. He is a popular speaker and author and in addition to his writing and research, has searched Turkey's Mt. Ararat several times for Noah's ark.\n\nHenry Morris, Ph.D., (deceased) earned the title, &quot;The Father of Modern Creationism,&quot; through with his numerous writings about the creation/evolution debate. Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled The Genesis Flood in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.He was the founder of the Institute for Creation Research in California.\n\nDr. Carl Wieland is Managing Director of Creation Ministries International in Brisbane, Australia. This ministry organization (which started as Creation Science Foundation, then Answers in Genesis) produces the family magazine Creation (now going to subscribers in over 100 countries), which he founded in 1978. Although Dr. Wieland's formal qualifications are in medicine and surgery (from Adelaide University in South Australia), he has not practised in the medical profession since 1986. He is a past president of the Christian Medical Fellowship of South Australia.\n\nJonathan Henry, Ph.D., became an active creationist after reading Dr. Henry Morris' book, Many Infallible Proofs. In 1974, he received his B.S. and became a lab instructor at the University of Alabama. From 1976-1978 he was a process engineer for Conoco Chemicals. From 1980-81 he worked in the chemical engineering department at the University of Kentucky.

At the same time, from 1984-1995 he worked at the University of Tennessee Chatanooga. From 1995-the present he worked and is working at Clearwater Christian College in Florida. He went to the University of Alabama and received his Bachelor of Sciences degree in Chemistry, went back to get his Master of Sciences and Ch.E, then got his Ph.D. from the University of Kentucky. In 1987 he began speaking and writing in defense of biblical creation, and authored The Astronomy Book for Master Books. Today he is chairman of the science division and Professor of Natural Science at Clearwater Christian College in Florida. Dr. Henry and his wife, Sharon, homeschool their four children.\n\nDr. Jack Cuozzo has been an orthodontist in New Jersey for 33 years.
