However, one or two of them have been a bit... uneven. &quot;Binaural&quot; (2000) and &quot;Riot Act&quot; (2002) come to mind.\n\nBut it's not a question of the band hitting a creative slump every now and then. No no. Looking into the studio outtakes it seems as though the band simply picked the wrong tracks for these albums, leaving some of the best songs off.\n\nSo I removed the less-than-great songs on &quot;Binaural&quot; (the three forgettable punky opening tracks for example... What the fuck was that about?) and replaced them with the &quot;Binaural&quot; sessions outtakes from the rarities compilation &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; (2003) and made my own version of &quot;Binaural&quot;. Very simple. I also moved the last couple of tracks around to make the huge epic, anthemic &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; the final track.\n\nSo instead of a so-so album with potential, you get an album that's just as good as anything they've ever released. \n\nI don't think I've listened to the real &quot;Binaural&quot; album once since I made this &quot;Trinaural&quot; version. No reason. It's just that good.\n\nFucking hell, I'm a genius. I should get an award.\n\n1. Sad\n2. Hitchhiker\n3. Light years\n4. Nothing as it seems\n5. Thin air\n6. In the moonlight\n7. Insignificance\n8. Of the girl\n9. Education\n10. Fatal\n11. Sweet lew\n12. Soon forget\n13.
