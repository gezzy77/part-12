Newly widowed, Rose holds herself responsible for the death of her husband, a well-known gangster. Anthony Quinn plays a widower who falls in love with Rose, much to the dismay of his daughter (Ina Balin), who fears that Quinn will be destroyed as thoroughly as Rose's first husband. All ends happily after Rose and her new beau align to find her unhappy runaway son (Jimmy Baird). Black Orchid tries too hard to be a &quot;slice of life;&quot; perhaps it might have fared better with a cast of unknowns, but then who'd go to see it?\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052631/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052631/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nMartin Ritt\n\n\n\n\n\tSophia Loren\t... \tRose Bianco\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tFrank Valente\n\n\tPeter Mark Richman... \tNoble\n\tVirginia Vincent... \tAlma Gallo\n\tFrank Puglia\t... \tHenry Gallo\n\n\nVideo #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Standard : NTSC\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.097\n      Stream size : 673 MiB (83%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 - 192 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 184 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 124 MiB (15%)\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec0e754baae5c195e467daacec6a14034b5e3df","amp;dn":"The+Black+Orchid+%281958%29+S.Loren%2CA.Quinn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec0e754baae5c195e467daacec6a14034b5e3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,192,231,84,186,174,92,25,94,70,125,170,206,198,161,64,52,181,227,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
