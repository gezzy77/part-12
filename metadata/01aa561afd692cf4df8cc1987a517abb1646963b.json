Possibly as a result of Simon's experience of orchestration with 'Still Life' At the Penguin CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (volume 6) he felt confident enough to write new pieces for large sections. \n\nNevertheless, this record retains the intimacy and charm of all previous works, featuring a recording of the electric Aeolian harp on Cadbury Hill, Somerset, and a piece dedicated to the memory of John Cage recorded at the Real World recording week in 1992. \n\nA very diverse record, an image painted on a broader canvas. \n\nCatalogue no: ZOPFD001 / 7 31451 84102 6 \n\nFrom Glasgow Herald \n&quot;Penguin CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Orchestra are a logically illogical blend of learning and instinct; technique and natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot; \n\nFrom Johnny Black \n&quot;Penguin CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© music combines orchestral instruments with folk instruments, classical ideas with electronic rhythms, stately melodies with a nice sense of swing.
