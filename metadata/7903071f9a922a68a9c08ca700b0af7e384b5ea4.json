From Above the Law to his Mountain Dew commercials, his entire career is covered in Vern's inimitable style.\n\nAs Vern himself puts it, Seagalogy is &quot;a book that will shake the very foundations of film criticism, break their wrists and then throw them through a window.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\n================\n\nAs a frequent writer for Ain't It Cool News, Vern has gained notoriety for his unorthodox reviewing style and his expertise in &quot;the films of Badass Cinema.&quot; His review of the slasher movie CHAOS earned him a wrestling challenge from its director; his explosive essay on the PG-13 rating of LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD prompted Bruce Willis himself to walk barefoot across the broken glass of movie nerd message boards to respond. Guillermo Del Toro, the director of PAN'S LABYRINTH, called Vern &quot;a national treasure.&quot; \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2341304.Seagalogy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2341304.Seagalogy&lt;/a&gt; - 4.33/5.0\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7903071f9a922a68a9c08ca700b0af7e384b5ea4","amp;dn":"Seagalogy%3A+A+Study+of+the+Ass-Kicking+Films+of+Steven+Seagal.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7903071f9a922a68a9c08ca700b0af7e384b5ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,3,7,31,154,146,42,104,169,192,140,167,0,176,175,126,56,75,94,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
