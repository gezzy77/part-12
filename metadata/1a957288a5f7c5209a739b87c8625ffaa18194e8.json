While the Fania Records label was no longer the most important or most influential Salsa label it was still releasing new music regularly and this Fania All Stars album was a very good album that proved that both the label and its legendary house band still had plenty to offer. \nThe album kicks off with the stunning &quot;Por Eso Yo Canto Salsa&quot;--a showcase for singers like Celia Cruz, Ismael Quintana, Pete &quot;Conde&quot; Rodriguez, Ismael Miranda and Adalberto Santiago (among others) to showcase their venerable improvisational skills as Salsa singers-- and it is clearly one of the album's key cuts. The Hector Lavoe-sung &quot;El Rey De La Puntualidad&quot; was the album's big hit while &quot;Usando El Coco&quot; is a showcase tune for Celia Cruz. \n'Lo Que Pida La Gente' is not an all-time classic album but it was one of 1984's most popular and most well-received Salsa albums.
