Exhaustively documented by intensive search of dozens of archives and months of interviews with government insiders, this biography digs up all the dirt - frightening, gory, hilarious - on the Bush dynasty: how the Bushes made their fortune building up Hitler and the Nazi war machine; Iran-Contra; Zapata's Watergate burglars; the Reagan shooting; the 'war hero' story; the secret government; 'Eugenic' population reduction plans; Kissinger, China, and genocide in the Third World; Luring Iraq to attack Kuwait; The Bush Leveraged Buyout Mob, theft of a nation; Jupiter Island, Skull and Bones, and other power bases. Essential reading as long as this Anglo-American oligarchy directs American politics, the &quot;Unauthorised Biography&quot; is a vivid X-ray of the presidential dynasty, and the private forces dominating both major political parties","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42f4e5ff194fb61da3009155556206a44f959bd","amp;dn":"Webster+Griffin+Tarpley+-+George+Bush+-+The+Unauthorized+Biograp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42f4e5ff194fb61da3009155556206a44f959bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,47,78,95,241,148,251,97,218,48,9,21,85,86,32,106,68,249,89,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
