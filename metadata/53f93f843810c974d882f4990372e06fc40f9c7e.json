The film is based on Ray Nelson's 1963 short story &quot;Eight O'Clock in the Morning&quot;.\n\n\nPart science fiction horror and part dark comedy, the film echoed contemporary fears of a declining economy, within a culture of greed and conspicuous consumption common among Americans in the 1980s. In They Live, the ruling class within the moneyed elite are in fact aliens managing human social affairs through the use of a signal on top of the TV broadcast that is concealing their appearance and subliminal messages in mass media.\n\n\nDATE&gt;\n\nDisc Title:     They.Live.1988.1080p.Blu-ray.ITA.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.2.0-EbP\nDisc Size:      22 090 993 712 bytes\nProtection:     AACS\nBD-Java:        No\nBDInfo:         0.5.6\n\nPLAYLIST REPORT:\n\nName:                   00002.MPLS\nLength:                 1:34:20 (h:m:s)\nSize:                   21 819 623 424 bytes\nTotal Bitrate:          30,84 Mbps\n\nVIDEO:\n\nCodec                   Bitrate             Description    \n-----                   -------             -----------    \nMPEG-4 AVC Video        25295 kbps          1080p / 24 fps / 16:9 / High Profile 4.1\n\nAUDIO:\n\nCodec                           Language        Bitrate         Description    \n-----                           --------        -------         -----------    \nDTS-HD Master Audio             Italian         3558 kbps       5.1 / 48 kHz / 3558 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit)\nDolby Digital Audio             English         224 kbps        2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / DN -4dB\nDolby Digital Audio             Italian         224 kbps        2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / DN -4dB\n\nSUBTITLES:\n\nCodec                           Language        Bitrate         Description    \n-----                           --------        -------         -----------    \nPresentation Graphics           Italian         28,753 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f93f843810c974d882f4990372e06fc40f9c7e","amp;dn":"They+Live+%281988%29+%5BBluRay+1080p-Ita+Eng-Sub+Ita%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f93f843810c974d882f4990372e06fc40f9c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,249,63,132,56,16,201,116,216,130,244,153,3,114,224,111,196,15,156,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
