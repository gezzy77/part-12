The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cook watches over her distractedly, for his thoughts are often on his son, Biju, who is hopscotching from one gritty New York restaurant to another. Kiran DesaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant novel, published to huge acclaim, is a story of joy and despair. Her characters face numerous choices that majestically illuminate the consequences of colonialism as it collides with the modern world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0dbd940e4282d53909e5a69241c30f0e2a3acd","amp;dn":"The+Inheritance+of+Loss+-+Kiran+Desai.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0dbd940e4282d53909e5a69241c30f0e2a3acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,13,189,148,14,66,130,213,57,9,229,166,146,65,195,15,14,42,58,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
