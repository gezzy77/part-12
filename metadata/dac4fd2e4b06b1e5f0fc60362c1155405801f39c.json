The 80.000 attendants were absolutely crazy, and played a major role in making this concert one of the greatest moments in their 2007 Turn It On Again Tour.\n\n-Simply a MUST for all Genesis-fans...\n\nBand-members:\n\nPhil Collins: Song, Drums\nMike Rutherford: Guitar\nTony Banks: Keyboard\nDaryl Stuermer: Guitar and bass guitar\nChester Thompson: Drums\n\n\n(This CD will not become avaliable in stores, since it is only avaliable via Themusic.com. Every Genesis show was recorded using the newest technology and put to sale on the aforementioned website)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac4fd2e4b06b1e5f0fc60362c1155405801f39c","amp;dn":"Genesis+live+at+Olympiastadium%2C+Berlin+03.07.07+-+Entire+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dac4fd2e4b06b1e5f0fc60362c1155405801f39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,196,253,46,75,6,177,229,240,252,96,54,44,17,85,64,88,1,243,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
