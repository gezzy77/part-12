It must embrace everything.'' Over the course of its nearly 300-year life, the symphony has indeed embraced almost every trend to be found in Western concert music.\n\nHumble Beginnings, Unmatched Achievement\n\nThe symphony evolved from the 17th-century Italian opera overture and the Baroque ripieno concerto.\n\nBy the mid to late 18th century, the symphony became the single most important genre of orchestral music.\n\nIn 300 yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with backdrops ranging from the French Revolution to the Soviet Empire, the Enlightenment to the Roaring TwentiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the symphony would arrive at where it stands today: one of the longest lived, and perhaps the most expressively inclusive, genres of instrumental music.\n\nIn this series of 24 45-minute lectures, Professor Robert Greenberg guides the listener on a survey of the symphony. You'll listen to selections from the greatest symphonies by many of the greatest composers of the past 300 years. You'll also hear selections from some overlooked works that, undeservedly, have been forgotten by contemporary audiences. \n\n\n24 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070889aa8e06f321fd1c26d586da682349a901bc","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Symphony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070889aa8e06f321fd1c26d586da682349a901bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,8,137,170,142,6,243,33,253,28,38,213,134,218,104,35,73,169,1,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
