But, at the same time, a growing number of companies and other collectives are flying under the radar, concealing their identities and activities. \n\nThis book offers a framework for thinking about how organizations and their members communicate identity to relevant audiences. Considering the degree to which organizations reveal themselves, the extent to which members express their identification with the organization, and whether the audience is public or local, author Craig R. Scott describes collectives as residing in &quot;regions&quot; that range from transparent to shaded, from shadowed to dark. Taking a closer look at groups like EarthFirst!, the Church of Scientology, Alcoholics Anonymous, the KKK, Skull and Bones, U.S. special mission units, men's bathhouses, and various terrorist organizations, this book draws attention to shaded, shadowed, and dark collectives as important organizations in the contemporary landscape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af77d32fc530291fac5a9bb22e32a5106f0da45b","amp;dn":"Anonymous+Agencies%2C+Backstreet+Businesses-+Scott+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af77d32fc530291fac5a9bb22e32a5106f0da45b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,119,211,47,197,48,41,31,172,90,155,178,46,50,165,16,111,13,164,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
