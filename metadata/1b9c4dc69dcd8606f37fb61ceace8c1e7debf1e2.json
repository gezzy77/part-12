Both Arcana and Sharona had explored scores of universes, each a duplicate of its own, without ever encountering another human civilization. Then that changed. Two survey expeditions met in the cool shadows of an autumn forest. \n\nNo one knows who shot first, but both sides have suffered heavy casualties, and each blames the other. Now both sides want possession of Hell's Gate, the cluster of inter-universal portals and their survey forces met in blood . . . and neither is prepared to let the other have it.\n\nArcana's wizards, dragons, and gryphons are about to meet Sharona's bolt-action rifles, machine guns, and mortars. Transport dragons are about to meet steam locomotives. And all that either side really knows is that neither of them has ever seen a war like the one about to begin.\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9c4dc69dcd8606f37fb61ceace8c1e7debf1e2","amp;dn":"Hell+Hath+No+Fury+by+David+Weber+and+Linda+Evans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9c4dc69dcd8606f37fb61ceace8c1e7debf1e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,156,77,198,157,205,134,6,243,127,182,28,234,206,140,30,125,235,241,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
