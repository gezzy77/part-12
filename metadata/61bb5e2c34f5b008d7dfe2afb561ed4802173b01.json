In the mid-1970s, while publisher Leonard Mogel was in Paris to jump-start the French edition of National Lampoon, he discovered the French science-fantasy magazine MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tal Hurlant which had debuted December 1974. The French title translates literally as &quot;Howling Metal.&quot;\n\nWhen Mogel licensed the American version, he chose to rename it, and Heavy Metal began in the U.S. on April, 1977 as a glossy, full-color monthly. Initially, it displayed translations of graphic stories originally published in MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tal Hurlant, including work by Enki Bilal, Jean Giraud (also known as Moebius), Philippe Druillet, Milo Manara and Philippe Caza. The magazine later ran Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore's ultra-violent RanXerox. Since the color pages had already been shot in France, the budget to reproduce them in the U.S. version was greatly reduced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bb5e2c34f5b008d7dfe2afb561ed4802173b01","amp;dn":"Heavy+Metal+Magazine+1977-20011+%2B+Specials+%28541+issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bb5e2c34f5b008d7dfe2afb561ed4802173b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,187,94,44,52,245,176,8,215,223,226,175,181,97,237,72,2,23,59,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
