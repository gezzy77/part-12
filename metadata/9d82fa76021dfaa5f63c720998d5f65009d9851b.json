The band&amp;#039;s first eight albums were released by Epic Records (controlled by Sony BMG) between 1969 and 1974; another seven LPs were issued by ABC and MCA (both controlled by Universal) between 1975 and 1982; Atlantic (controlled by Warner) released two Poco albums in 1982 and 1984; and Legacy, the gold-selling Poco reunion album, was released by RCA (controlled by Sony BMG) in 1989. Since then, the group has recorded for independent labels. This complicated history of affiliations has tended to mean that Poco collections consist of the Epic or ABC/MCA material, but not both. Now, Hip-O Records, Universal&amp;#039;s reissue imprint, has partially solved the problem by licensing material from Sony BMG, Warner, and Poco&amp;#039;s own Drifter&amp;#039;s Church label for this two-disc, two-hour-and-20-minute, 34-track compilation, including material spanning the years 1969 to 2005. It is, unquestionably, the most extensive Poco compilation ever released. It is good enough, in fact, to make a Poco fan wish it were perfect, which it is not. The trouble is, simply, that not enough tracks were licensed from the Epic years. Perhaps that&amp;#039;s an unfair criticism, since so many Poco best-ofs contain either all Epic tracks or all ABC/MCA ones. But representing the Epic albums with only five tracks, when the ABC/MCA years provide 21, is simply disproportionate. Poco scored some of its biggest hits on ABC, but it also made some negligible albums for MCA, while its Epic albums were consistent modest sellers. A Poco compilation missing, for example, &quot;C&amp;#039;mon&quot; and &quot;Just for Me and You&quot; seems incomplete. That said, this compilation does make good choices among the handful of Epic tracks included, and that judicious selection continues through the ABC, MCA, Atlantic, RCA, and Drifter&amp;#039;s Church tracks. Maybe the perfect Poco collection will have to wait for another super merger among the major labels; until then, this is the next best thing. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPoco - Gold\n\n\nRip Info\n--------\n\nArtist: Poco\nAlbum Title: Gold\nRecord Label: Hip-O\nRip Date: 2007-08-19\nStore date : 2006-09-19\nCatalog Number:\nURL :\nGenre: Pop\nYear: 2006\nSource: CD\nEncoder: LAME 3.97 -V2 --vbr-new\nQuality: 198 kbps avg / 44.1KHz / Joint Stereo\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n\nDisc 1/2\n--------\n01 Pickin&amp;#039; Up The Pieces                          3:20\n02 You Better Think Twice                         3:22\n03 Bad Weather                                    5:04\n04 A Good Feelin&amp;#039; To Know                         3:33\n05 I Can See Everything                           3:33\n06 Keep On Tryin&amp;#039;                                 2:54\n07 Makin&amp;#039; Love                                    2:56\n08 Dallas                                         3:29\n09 Starin&amp;#039; At The Sky                             3:00\n10 Too Many Nights Too Long                       6:02\n11 Rose Of Cimarron                               6:44\n12 Indian Summer                                  4:42\n13 Me And You                                     2:47\n14 Find Out In Time                               3:56\n15 Legend                                         4:14\n16 Spellbound                                     5:16\n17 Magnolia (Live)                                6:49\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  71:41\nDisc 2/2\n--------\n01 Heart Of The Night                             4:52\n02 Crazy Love                                     2:57\n03 Barbados                                       3:31\n04 Little Darlin&amp;#039;                                 3:44\n05 Under The Gun                                  3:13\n06 Midnight Rain                                  4:26\n07 Streets Of Paradise                            3:46\n08 Widowmaker                                     3:39\n09 Cajun Moon                                     3:59\n10 Shoot For The Moon                             2:45\n11 Ghost Town                                     5:39\n12 Days Gone By                                   3:49\n13 Call It Love                                   4:16\n14 Nothin&amp;#039; To Hide                                4:25\n15 If Your Heart Needs A Hand                     5:00\n16 Shake It                                       4:54\n17 Save A Corner Of Your Heart For Me (Live)      3:52\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  68:47\n                                                --------\n                                                02:20:28\n                                                210.35 megs\n\nRip Notes\n---------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d82fa76021dfaa5f63c720998d5f65009d9851b","amp;dn":"POCO+-+Gold+%282006-Remastered-2CD-VBR198kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d82fa76021dfaa5f63c720998d5f65009d9851b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,130,250,118,2,29,250,165,246,60,114,9,152,213,246,80,9,217,133,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
