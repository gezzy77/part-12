The band's line-up comprises vocalist Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk. Critics have noted Rage Against the Machine for its &quot;fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of punk, hip-hop, and thrash.&quot; Rage Against the Machine drew inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy and Urban Dance Squad. As of 2009, they have sold over 14 million records worldwide.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/e91e679af937ebc7dcad94010f5abe27/857611.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/e91e679af937ebc7dcad94010f5abe27/857611.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1 Guerrilla Radio 3:26\n2 Killing In The Name 5:13\n3 People Of The Sun 2:30\n4 Calm Like A Bomb 4:58\n5 Bullet In The Head 5:07\n6 The Ghost Of Tom Joad 5:41\n7 Sleep Now In The Fire 3:25\n8 Bombtrack 4:04\n9 Bulls On Parade 3:51\n10 Born Of A Broken Man 4:41\n11 Freedom 6:06\n12 Vietnow 4:39\n13 Maria 3:48\n14 Know Your Enemy 4:54\n15 Down Rodeo 5:20\n16 Take The Power Back 5:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff650d868690be89724812ddcf0a886622a80ab","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+The+Machine+-+Platinum+Collection+2000+%5BMp3+192+kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff650d868690be89724812ddcf0a886622a80ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,246,80,216,104,105,11,232,151,36,129,45,220,240,168,134,98,42,128,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
