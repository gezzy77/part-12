Since then the base has gained worldwide notoriety. Satellite images of the area show seven runways and over 25 hangars, and many claim it is here that the US government carries out experiments on everything from UFOs to aliens themselves.\n\nIndeed, many insist that the true purpose of the site is to reverse-engineer alien spacecraft recovered from the infamous Roswell crash site. Yet, officially, Area 51 doesn't even exist...\n\nSo what really goes on in this remote part of the Nevada desert? Find out from the people who worked there who freely share their stories on camera for the first time. Hear how military workers deceived even their closest family members to work on incredible projects, and how Cold War paranoia fuelled unparalleled levels of secrecy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Christopher Kent\n=============================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Written by: Peter Yost\n=================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Area 51 I Was There\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:59\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1973 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    635 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5069b6aa0506e52ba2fc940be145ec51101e5995","amp;dn":"Area+51+I+Was+There-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5069b6aa0506e52ba2fc940be145ec51101e5995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,105,182,170,5,6,229,43,162,252,148,11,225,69,236,81,16,30,89,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
