It's also not a surprise that he's a (self-professed) &quot;nympho&quot; either, but he sheds more light on that throughout Mature Themes, which is both his most accomplished album and some of his most twistedly immature music. As on Before Today, the album's sound is just a shade clearer than what came before it, and his backing band Haunted Graffiti's tight musicianship provides the perfect foil for Pink's stream-of-consciousness sprawl. But while Mature Themes' conceptual glue makes it more cohesive than all of his previous work put together, glorious randomness abounds: not many artists would interrupt a song to order food at a drive-thru, as Pink does on the rhapsodic &quot;Schnitzel Boogie,&quot; or write a song about being bros with a legendary seer, as he does on &quot;Nostradamus and Me,&quot; one of his more ecstatically drifting pieces of chillwave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962bc2ae27f3629609b1c36dfeeee66714dd0ece","amp;dn":"Ariel+Pink%27s+Haunted+Graffiti+-+Mature+Themes+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962bc2ae27f3629609b1c36dfeeee66714dd0ece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,43,194,174,39,243,98,150,9,177,195,109,254,238,230,103,20,221,14,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
