Originating as a leftfield dubstep outlet under the direction of DJ/producer Kode9 10 years ago, the influential label has since diffused across a wide spectrum of styles and genres, and, while often associated with &quot;dark and brooding instrumental music,&quot; the forthcoming release reportedly aims to cast some sunlight over this &quot;dread-filled reputation.&quot; Hyperdub 10.2 follows last month's inaugural, dancefloor-oriented issue of the series and will feature materialÃ¢â‚¬â€some of which has been previously unreleasedÃ¢â‚¬â€from a formidable roster of contributors including Burial, Cooly G, and the late DJ Rashad to Dean Blunt &amp; Inga Copeland, Ikonika, and Kode9 himself.\n\nThe forthcoming compilation (with tracklist posted below) officially lands on July 22, and Hyperdub is also slated to stage a spate of international showcases throughout the year and a US tour in early fall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43960cda14d4b69c9dc6860eeab9e33461aa2ef0","amp;dn":"VA+-+Hyperdub+10.2+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43960cda14d4b69c9dc6860eeab9e33461aa2ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,150,12,218,20,212,182,156,157,198,134,14,234,185,227,52,97,170,46,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
