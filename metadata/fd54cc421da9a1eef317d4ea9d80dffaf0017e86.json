Reports werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t 100-percent certain, but sadly, the Young family has officially confirmed the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition.\n\nReports from the Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian suggested that Malcolm YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysterious health issue was dementia brought on by a stroke. Up to that point, the Young family chose not to specify what caused Malcolm to step away from AC/DC while conflicting reports pointed towards a stroke, dementia, AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and even cancer.\n\nIt turns out that Malcolm, 61, has been stricken with at least one of the aforementioned conditions. Though the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dementia is widely thought to have been caused by a stroke, the Young family has not revealed what prefaced MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current condition.\n\nIn a statement issued to People, the YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offered a short piece of insight:\n\n    Malcolm is suffering from dementia and the family thanks you for respecting their privacy.\n\nLast week, AC/DC announced that their new album will be called Ã¢â‚¬ËœRock or BustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and will see a Dec. 2 release. The iconic act also confirmed that Malcolm Young would not be returning to the band in any capacity. A new AC/DC song, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlay Ball,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ was also featured in a new MLB Postseason trailer.\n\nOnce again, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to wish Malcolm Young and his loved ones the very best.\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd54cc421da9a1eef317d4ea9d80dffaf0017e86","amp;dn":"AC-DC+Play+Ball+and+Rock+or+Bust+%28Singles%29mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd54cc421da9a1eef317d4ea9d80dffaf0017e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,84,204,66,29,169,161,238,243,23,212,234,157,128,223,250,240,1,126,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
