Meaning, for each movie I used, besides my personal taste, multiple reviews, and only those AT LEAST above average could make it to the cut. Not only that, most are at least &quot;good&quot;. A lot are also reviewed as &quot;very good&quot;. In MULTIPLE reviews, so taste differs true, but you won't find a weak movie in this selection. I also had to let one go that wasn't a favorite of me, but I found it to be decent. It ALMOST made it, and it JUST didn't, by a whisker (Dreamcatcher).\n\nMost are .avi files, xvid or divx encoded. Download an (Google:) &quot;all-in-one codec pack&quot; if you have any trouble playing one of these files. Most of you should be able to play it perfectly though.\n\nHere is the list of the movies (and mini series) that are a crowning of his works:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1408\nCarrie\nChildren Of The Corn\nChristine\nCujo\nIT\nMisery\nPet Cemetery\nSecret Window\nStorm Of The Century\nThe Dead Zone\nThe Mist\nThe Shining\nThe Stand\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe King: (source = Wikipedia)\n\nStephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American writer of contemporary horror fiction, science fiction, fantasy literature, and screenplays.
