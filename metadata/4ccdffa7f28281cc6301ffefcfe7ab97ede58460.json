He's already the focus\nof the first single, &quot;Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father),&quot; in\nwhich she questions if he ever loved her, but she also berates him in &quot;My\nInnocence&quot; for allegedly stealing her childhood away. &quot;You broke me in with\nyour mistakes,&quot; she sings. &quot;Thanks for the breakthrough.&quot; Still, she vows to be\nresilient and says she's more independent because he wasn't there to look after\nher.\n\nNext on Lindsay's list are lost loves - those who sent her mixed messages (&quot;A\nLittle More Personal&quot;) or cast her aside for another woman too carelessly (&quot;If\nYou Were Me&quot;). She mourns one in &quot;Black Hole,&quot; getting paper cuts re-reading\nold love letters, realizes another was a bad fit two years too late in &quot;If\nIt's Alright,&quot; but saves her venom for the one she wishes were as &quot;desperate\nand dying inside&quot; as the way he made her feel in &quot;I Live for the Day&quot;: &quot;I live\nfor the tears to fall down your face.&quot;\n\nLindsay is more dimensional than just a woman scorned, though - she's also\nquestioning her life as a star, which might be &quot;A Beautiful Life&quot; but that\ndoesn't stop her from feeling worn out. She prays to God because sometimes she\njust doesn't know who else would listen, or if she dares let them: &quot;I talk in\nmy sleep/ That's the one place I know no one can hear me.&quot; And she realizes\nthe incongruity of wishing people would care when she doesn't let them in the\nfirst place. On &quot;Fast Lane&quot; she sings, &quot;So I drive around this superficial\ntown/ With a smile on my face/ No one really knows how I feel inside/ And I'm\nkeeping it that way.&quot;\n\nLindsay's sound also gets more Raw - she's teamed up with former Evanescence\nguitarist Ben Moody and Marvelous 3's Butch Walker as her producers to bring\nout her inner rock chick. Moody helps her cover Stevie Nicks' &quot;Edge of\nSeventeen&quot; while Walker assists on her take on Cheap Trick's &quot;I Want You to\nWant Me.&quot;\n\nA Little More Personal (Raw) is due December 6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ccdffa7f28281cc6301ffefcfe7ab97ede58460","amp;dn":"Lindsay+Lohan-A+Little+More+Personal+%28Raw%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ccdffa7f28281cc6301ffefcfe7ab97ede58460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,205,255,167,242,130,129,204,99,1,255,239,207,231,171,151,237,229,132,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
