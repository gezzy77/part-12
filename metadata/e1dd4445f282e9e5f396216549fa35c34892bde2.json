Slade gained his longevity and increased physical prowess through army experiments.  He has often clashed with the Titans, but has also worked alongside them on occasion.  Recently, Slade has returned to his violent ways.\n\nSlade first appeared in New Teen Titans #2 (1980) and made regular guest appearances throughout the numerous Titan titles in the 80s and 90s.  Based on the popularity of Marvel's Punisher, DC Comics decided to launch the Titans' tough mercenary into his own title.  The Deathstroke series ran for 60 issues from 1991 to 1996.  Marv Wolfman wrote the title throughout the entire run, with art by Steve Erwin.  During the course of this high-octane action series, Deathstroke traveled around the world taking on a variety of contracts.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1dd4445f282e9e5f396216549fa35c34892bde2","amp;dn":"Deathstroke+The+Terminator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1dd4445f282e9e5f396216549fa35c34892bde2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,221,68,69,242,130,233,229,243,150,33,101,73,250,53,195,72,146,189,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
