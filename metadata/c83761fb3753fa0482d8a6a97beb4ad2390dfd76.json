Tyrants, perverts, tragic crushes, gossip, cruel jokes, and the hallucinatory effects of absinthe -- Flannery and the seven other friends in the Basic Eight have suffered through it all. But now, on tabloid television, they're calling Flannery a murderer, which is a total lie. It's true that high school can be so stressful sometimes. And it's true that sometimes a girl just has to kill someone. But Flannery wants you to know that she's not a murderer at all -- she's a murderess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83761fb3753fa0482d8a6a97beb4ad2390dfd76","amp;dn":"The+Basic+Eight+%28387%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83761fb3753fa0482d8a6a97beb4ad2390dfd76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,55,97,251,55,83,250,4,130,216,166,169,123,235,74,210,57,13,253,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
