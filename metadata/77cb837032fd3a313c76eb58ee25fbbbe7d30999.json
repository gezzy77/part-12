The African artist revisited his signature tune on 1994's Wakafrika, which boasts an all-star cast that includes Peter Gabriel as well as Haiti's Papa Wemba and African heroes Ladysmith Black Mambazo, King Sunny Ade, and Youssou N'Dour. With such a stellar bunch of guests, Wakafrika should have been outstanding instead of simply decent. But while it isn't the all-out masterpiece it should have been, there's a lot that's enjoyable on this CD, including the reggae-influenced &quot;Em'ma,&quot; a remake of Gabriel's &quot;Biko,&quot; and the &quot;Makossa&quot;-ish jams &quot;Wakafrika&quot; and &quot;Jingo.&quot; Though likable enough, Dibango's new version of &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; falls short of the excellence of the original -- but then, one couldn't realistically expect him to improve on perfection.
