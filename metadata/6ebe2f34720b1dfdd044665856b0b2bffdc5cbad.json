This is a serious film that deals with a married couple's difficulty surviving in an uncaring society experiencing economic collapse.\n\nAlthough other viewers think the movie is set in the Nazi era, a closer view makes clear that it is set immediately after WWI, probably about 1919. It is interesting to watch this back-to-back with Modern Times (1936), which was probably inspired by it. \n\nThere was a 1933 German version, which I have been unable to find.\n\nPlease seed this, I want to upload other stuff in future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebe2f34720b1dfdd044665856b0b2bffdc5cbad","amp;dn":"Little+Man%2C+What+Now%3F+%281934%29+Frank+Borzage+Hans+Fallada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebe2f34720b1dfdd044665856b0b2bffdc5cbad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,190,47,52,114,11,29,253,208,68,102,88,86,176,178,191,253,197,203,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
