This complicated process was supervised by producer Carl Macek, a pioneer of the anime industry in United States.\n\nThis combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called &quot;Protoculture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nThe seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ three chapters included The Macross Saga, The Robotech Masters, and The New Generation. Released in 1985, Robotech was the first anime (Japanese animation) series that many fans had seen, and is often accredited as the cause of the anime fandom that continues to grow today in the United States.\n\n----------------------\n\nThe Masters (the second Robotech war) focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture. Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of LifeÃ¢â‚¬â€the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.\n\n----------------------\n\nThis is from the original DVD, put out by ADV films in 2001.  These are the un-remasted, first time on DVD sets.\nThese episodes are saved as Season 02.
