If you like it, buy it. (I suggest the hard copy, since APress will either give you the PDF or charge you something like $10 for it, which you'd already have! :)\n\nNew version of this should be out soon. I don't use the CSLA (or whatever it's called) framework, but it's a good learning tool. You can get the updated code from the author's website.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ac448b7ccf27ceb999c3217d3e832e26303dbd","amp;dn":"Expert+C%23+2008+Business+Objects+%28Apress%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ac448b7ccf27ceb999c3217d3e832e26303dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,172,68,139,124,207,39,206,185,153,195,33,125,62,131,46,38,48,61,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
