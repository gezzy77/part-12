Cloud computing is a dramatic shift in how applications are developed and used---and even in what applications are. \nWith cloud computing, developers are no longer building applications that run on a user's desktop computer. Instead, they're building services on the network that can be used by thousands of users at the same time. \n\n Cloud services are an exciting opportunity for developers: the cloud is a platform for creating services, a new kind of application that can reach more users, and provide those users with more capabilities than a desktop application ever could. \nBuilding applications as cloud services also makes them scalable: cloud applications can easily and smoothly adapt from running on a single computer for a single user to running on thousands of computers for millions of users. \n\nCode in the Cloud will teach you what a cloud service is, and how it differs from traditional applications. It will show you how to build a cloud service, taking advantage of the services that AppEngine makes available to you, \nusing iterative development of a simple application to guide you through the different aspects of AppEngine development, using either Python or Java.\n\n Through the process of working on a simple application, you'll learn about how to build an application as a service; how to manage persistent data using AppEngine; how to build dynamic, \ninteractive user interfaces that run in a user's web-browser; how to manage security in a web application; and how to interact with other services running in the AppEngine cloud\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  just Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d858a5cacf434f650f2112e0f9207fe9fdcec705","amp;dn":"Code+in+the+Cloud-+Programming+Google+AppEngine%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d858a5cacf434f650f2112e0f9207fe9fdcec705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,88,165,202,207,67,79,101,15,33,18,224,249,32,127,233,253,206,199,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
