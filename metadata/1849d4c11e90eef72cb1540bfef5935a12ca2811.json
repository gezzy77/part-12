True? Here are quips, quotes, and questions from a distinguished assortment of geniuses and jokers, giving readers a chance to decide for themselves....\n\nWhen I think of all the harm [the bible] has done, I despair of ever writing anything to equal it. - Oscar Wilde\n\nSAINT, n. A dead sinner revised and edited. - Ambrose Bierce\n\nThere ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer. There never has been an answer. That's the answer. - Gertrude Stein\n\nDo not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are skeptical. - Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nMillions long for immortality who don't know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon. - Susan Ertz\n\nGod is love, but get it in writing. - Gypsy Rose Lee\n\nNothing is at last sacred but the integrity of our own mind. - Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nThe fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. - George Bernard Shaw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1849d4c11e90eef72cb1540bfef5935a12ca2811","amp;dn":"The+Atheist%5C%27s+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1849d4c11e90eef72cb1540bfef5935a12ca2811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,73,212,193,30,144,238,247,44,177,84,11,254,245,147,90,18,202,40,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
