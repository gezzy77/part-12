The file extension is *.ape . Once i had the decoder for &quot;Monkey&amp;#039;s&quot; installed Winamp played it great, i suggest using the same. For burning i would use Poikosoft&amp;#039;s Easy CD-DA Extractor, the reason for this is for one it is what i used to rip it with and for reason 2 is it also can burn it to cd for you. I tried using nero with the &quot;Monkey&amp;#039;s audio decoder nero plugin&quot;,  but it made nero unstable so i would not suggest this. Please i love to hear comments and i welcome them good or bad. Plus i will also warn you there is no album art sorry but there is a m3u file. Well last but not least please seed for at least a week as it hard to find good 80&amp;#039;s music in Lossless format which was not re-recorded from previous downloaded files, this copy came from a pristine unscratched original cd. I liked all but 2 songs but even they didn&amp;#039;t warrant skipping over!!
