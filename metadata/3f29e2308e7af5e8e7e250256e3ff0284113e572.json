Unlike his bands from the 1970s, this particular unit leaves plenty of space and plays much more melodically. Guitarist Mike Stern lets loose some fury, but electric bassist Marcus Miller is not reluctant to walk now and then in a straight-ahead fashion, drummer Al Foster and percussionist Mino Cinelu are tasteful, and Bill Evans gets in a few good spots on soprano. \nAs for Miles, he was gradually regaining his earlier form.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nWe Want Miles\n\n1982\n\nExtended Edition / Bonus Tracks\n\n2009\n\n\n  2CDs / 2009 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n  NÃ‚Âº65 &amp; 66: Complete Columbia Album Collection\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\n1.
