In his haste to enjoy everything, he ends up getting\naway from Arielle\n\nHe hears her calling for him, but the forest is such an\ninteresting place. There are so many things, so much space\nSome little creatures challenge him. Bast pursues them. It\nfeels great to run in the forest\nHe is about to catch one of them. He jumps to grab it but\nmisses. He falls on top of some old stones\nSomething breaks under him. A cold breeze ruffles the trees\nchilling him to the bones. A smoke rises forming a shadow\nSomeone, something, hovers above him. Some ancient\nfoul-smelling thing that nails him to the ground. Bast is\nunable to move\n\nNearby, Arielle calls for him. The thing, the Spirit, turns\naround. As Arielle comes closer, the Spirit flies in her\ndirection and envelops her. Bast hears the muffled screams of\nArielle. They grow fainter as the spirit disappears in the\nforest\n\nBast is alone. The sounds of the night emphasize that feeling\nArielle is gone and its his own fault. He realizes that the\nonce pleasant forest has become a strange and dark place.
