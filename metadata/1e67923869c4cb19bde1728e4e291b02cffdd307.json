This is the second box set of Webern's works conducted by Boulez. 6 CD's, released by DG.\n\nContains individual tracks, sorted by the title of the work, as opposed to CD images.\n\n\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e67923869c4cb19bde1728e4e291b02cffdd307","amp;dn":"Webern+-+Complete+Works+%28Boulez%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e67923869c4cb19bde1728e4e291b02cffdd307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,103,146,56,105,196,203,25,189,225,114,142,78,41,27,2,207,253,211,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
