From the British new romantic movement to hip-hop to techno, the group's self-described &quot;robot pop&quot; -- hypnotically minimal, obliquely rhythmic music performed solely via electronic means -- resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late- 20th century, and as pioneers of the electronic music form, their enduring influence cannot be overstated. Kraftwerk emerged from the same German experimental music community of the late '60s which also spawned Can and Tangerine Dream; primary members Florian Schneider and Ralf HÃƒÂ¼tter first met as classical music students at the Dusseldorf Conservatory, originally teaming in the group Organisation and issuing a 1970 album, Tone Float, in the U.K. Schneider and HÃƒÂ¼tter soon disbanded Organisation, re-christening themselves Kraftwerk (German for &quot;power station&quot;), beginning work on their own studio (later dubbed Kling Klang), and immersing their music in the fledgling world of minimalist electronics; their 1971 debut, titled simply Kraftwerk 1, offered a hint of their unique aesthetic in its earliest form, already implementing innovations including Schneider's attempts at designing homemade rhythm machines. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tK &amp; L\nCatalog:\t\tUnknown\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Die Roboter\n02.Komputerwelt\n03.Taschenrechner\n04.Dentaku\n05.Radioaktivitat\n06.Heimcomputer\n07.It's More Fun to Compute\n08.Trans Europa Express\n09.Autobahn\n10.Numern\n11.Spacelab\n12.Music Non Stop\n13.Computerliebe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d64adf550ffbfa9bb9522dc17c64a962210565","amp;dn":"Kraftwerk+-+The+Very+Best+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d64adf550ffbfa9bb9522dc17c64a962210565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,214,74,223,85,15,251,250,155,185,82,45,193,124,100,169,98,33,5,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
