In Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1981, twenty-seven-year-old Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands went on a hunger  strike to protest the British government's refusal to recognize him and his fellow IRA inmates as political prisoners. McQueen dramatizes prison existence and Sands' final days in a way that is purely experiential, even abstract, a succession of images full of both beauty and horror. Featuring an intense performance by Michael Fassbender, Hunger is an unflinching, transcendent depiction of what a human being is willing to endure to be heard.\n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986233/ | Rating: 7.6 / 10 (6,425 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Hunger.2008.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.76 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 36mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 615 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                            \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nBit rate                         : 2 114 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 166 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.340\nStream size                      : 1.42 GiB (81%)\n\nAudio.                       \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 308 MiB (17%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nSubtitles.\n\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID/Info                    : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:02:10.363                     : :Chapter 2\n00:09:18.624                     : :Chapter 3\n00:16:22.014                     : :Chapter 4\n00:25:31.930                     : :Chapter 5\n00:31:11.436                     : :Chapter 6\n00:35:09.474                     : :Chapter 7\n00:38:03.180                     : :Chapter 8\n00:43:43.654                     : :Chapter 9\n00:45:34.798                     : :Chapter 10\n00:54:42.345                     : :Chapter 11\n01:03:08.684                     : :Chapter 12\n01:09:57.426                     : :Chapter 13\n01:13:38.113                     : :Chapter 14\n01:19:38.840                     : :Chapter 15\n01:27:12.794                     : :Chapter 16\n01:31:33.054                     : :Chapter 17\n01:36:15.319                     : :Chapter 18\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e447ae9cd7657f2e2cd9d56ec0278d8ddc43e2f","amp;dn":"Hunger.2008.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e447ae9cd7657f2e2cd9d56ec0278d8ddc43e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,68,122,233,205,118,87,242,226,205,157,86,236,2,120,216,221,196,62,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
