Again \n\nThanks to the newfound success of &quot;real&quot; country singers like Gretchen Wilson and Toby Keith, not to mention the neo-outlaw duo Big &amp; Rich, Brooks &amp; Dunn return to their Nashville roots on HILLBILLY DELUXE. After a string of increasingly pop-oriented ... Full Descriptionalbums, the change does them good. The first single, &quot;Play Something Country,&quot; could be the best jukebox song since Alan Jackson's early-1990s hit &quot;Don't Rock the Jukebox.&quot; From that opening track onwards, Ronnie Dunn and Kix Brooks stick to the basics: broken hearts (&quot;Her West Was Wilder&quot; and &quot;I May Never Get Over You&quot; and broken bottles (on the tough-guy &quot;Whiskey Do My Talkin'&quot; and the celebratory &quot;Just Another Neon Night&quot;. They don't abandon their rock flirtations entirely--Sheryl Crow drops by on &quot;Building Bridges,&quot; and the stomping title track edges towards Big &amp; Rich territory --but HILLBILLY DELUXE is the most purely country album Brooks &amp; Dunn have released since 1993's HARD WORKIN' MAN, and it's one of their most entertaining ever. \n\nAudio Mixers: Ronnie Dunn; Jason Gantt; Jeff Kersey; Steve Marcantonio. \n\nRecording information: Cyber Ranch; Emerald Entertainment's Tracking Room; Lobstar Studio; Ocean Way Nashville Recording Studios; Sound Emporium, Nashville, TN; Starstruck Studios; Talent Shop Studios; The Rukkus Room; The Sound Kitchen, Nashville, TN; Tin Ear. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc4821a30e6680f5a465489973de8ab3636accd","amp;dn":"Brooks+%26+Dunn+-+Hillbilly+Deluxe+%28EAC+FLAC%29+ResourceRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc4821a30e6680f5a465489973de8ab3636accd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,196,130,26,48,230,104,15,90,70,84,137,151,61,232,171,54,54,172,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
