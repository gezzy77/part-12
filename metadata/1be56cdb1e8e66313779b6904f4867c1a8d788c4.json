Bodycall\nALBUM TITLE....... Mechanically Recovered Meat (2009)\nGENRE............. Electronic\nSTYLE............. (in order of relevance) Dark-Electro, Aggrotech/Hellectro, EBM,\n                   Synthpop, Darkwave, Industrial, Gothic\nCOVER ART......... Included\nMORE INFO......... www.last.fm/music/Bodycall\n                   www.bodycall.net\nALBUM RELEASED:... 2009\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBodycall was formed in 2002 in Wroclaw, Poland. At the very begining Bodycall was a hybrid of many dark electronic underground genres, like dark electro, ebm, darkwave, synthpop, even with some vague gothic flavour. Bodycall's musicians were, at various stages involved in numerous death metal/grindcore bands, several hardcore techno, trance or, more recently, dark electronic projects. \n\n&quot;Mechanically Recovered Meat&quot; contains remixes of bands' previously released songs. As usually in this musical genre, a remix means that the songs were completely re-written and have musically little in common with the original ones. The style ranges from Dark Electro and Aggrotech to a harder variety of Synthpop.\n\nThis release certainly is a must-have add to the music collection of every dark independent scene's follower. Those favouring aggresive but melodic and danceable tunes will be more than pleased.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Beyond Control (2009 Comatose Mix)\n02. Disciples of Hedone (Club Mix)\n03. You and Me (Recovery Mix)\n04. Fools' Paradise (Too Disco Mix)\n05. Fools' Paradise (Harsh Mix)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBodycall is similiar (often very remotely) to, or inspired by: \nAmduscia, Apoptygma Berzerk, Assemblage 23, Blutengel, Combichrist, Covenant, Das Ich, Deine Lakaien, Diary of Dreams, Feindflug, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Funker Vogt, God Module, Grendel, GGFH, Hocico, Icon of Coil, In Strict Confidence, Project Pitchfork, Psyclon Nine, Spetsnaz, Suicide Commando, Tactical Sekt, VNV Nation, Wolfsheim, Wumpscut.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be56cdb1e8e66313779b6904f4867c1a8d788c4","amp;dn":"Bodycall-Mechanically_Recovered_Meat_EP-Dark_Electro_EBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be56cdb1e8e66313779b6904f4867c1a8d788c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,229,108,219,30,142,102,49,55,121,182,144,79,72,103,193,168,215,136,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
