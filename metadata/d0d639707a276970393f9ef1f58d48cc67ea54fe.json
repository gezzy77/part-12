The multi-platinum success of Chapman's eponymous 1988 debut was unexpected, and it had lasting impact. Although Chapman was working from the same confessional singer/songwriter foundation that had been popularized in the '70s, her songs were fresh and powerful, driven by simple melodies and affecting lyrics. At the time of her first album, there were only a handful of artists performing such a style successfully, and her success ushered in a new era of singer/songwriters that lasted well into the '90s. Furthermore, her album helped usher in the era of political correctness -- along with 10,000 Maniacs and R.E.M., Chapman's liberal politics proved enormously influential on American college campuses in the late '80s. Of course, such implications meant that Chapman's subsequent recordings were greeted with mixed reactions, but after several years out of the spotlight, she managed to make a very successful comeback in 1996 with her fourth album, New Beginning, thanks to the Top Ten single &quot;Give Me One Reason.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac Perfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner Bros.\nCatalog#:\t\t9627002\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2001 import Collection is the first compilation to round up Tracy Chapman's key tracks, and it succeeds on every level. All the hits (and almost-hits) are here, beginning with her two U.S. Top Tens -- the legendary &quot;Fast Car&quot; and the bluesy comeback hit &quot;Give Me One Reason.&quot; Other charted singles on this album include the fiery, politically charged &quot;Talkin' Bout a Revolution,&quot; the ghostly, self-determined &quot;Crossroads,&quot; the 2000 single &quot;Telling Stories,&quot; and &quot;Baby Can I Hold You,&quot; arguably one of the most stirring and beautiful songs ever recorded. In fact, this set features tracks from all five of Chapman's albums, but, since her musical output has been so consistent, several favorites, such as &quot;Freedom Now&quot; from Crossroads, were left off, and Matters of the Heart is represented only by two tracks. Regardless, every song on this collection is a gem, but, in reality, nothing compares to the modern masterpieces she created with the emotional car wreck that is &quot;Fast Car&quot; and the touching, desperate love plea that is &quot;Baby Can I Hold You.&quot; A wonderful collection, representing some of the finest work from one of the latter 20th century's most celebrated American artists. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Fast Car\n02.Subcity\n03.Baby Can I Hold You\n04.The Promise\n05.I'm Ready\n06.Crossroads\n07.Bang Bang Bang\n08.Telling Stories\n09.Smoke And Ashes\n10.Speak The Word\n11.Wedding Song\n12.Open Arms\n13.Give Me One Reason\n14.Talkin' Bout A Revolution\n15.She's Got Her Ticket\n16.All That You Have Is Your Soul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0d639707a276970393f9ef1f58d48cc67ea54fe","amp;dn":"Tracy+Chapman+-+Collection+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0d639707a276970393f9ef1f58d48cc67ea54fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,214,57,112,122,39,105,112,57,63,158,241,245,141,72,204,103,234,84,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
