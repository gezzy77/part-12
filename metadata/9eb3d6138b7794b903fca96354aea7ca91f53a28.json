It all started in 2007 when Corey Lowery (Stuck\nMojo/Stereomud/Dark New Day) and B.C. Kochmit (Switched) started to construct\nwhat would eventually become the foundation of this Empire. Along with the help\nof Morgan Rose (Sevendust) on drums, they started to write and experiment with\ntheir sound.\n\nAfter 2 years of writing and searching for the right voice of their Empire, they\nfound Donald Carpenter (Submersed) in October of 2009. Recently, acclaimed\ndrummer Will Hunt (Evanescence/Dark New Day) has entered the fold on the eve of\nintroducing their debut album Moment Of Impact.
