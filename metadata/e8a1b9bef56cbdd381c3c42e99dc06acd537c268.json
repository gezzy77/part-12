Allow me to clarify for you:\nThere are 3 Out Of Our Heads Releases (all were released with lower case titles):\nJuly 30, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl out of our heads\n(the heads cover with Keith at center)\nSeptember 24, 1965 - U.K. Decca Records vinyl out of our heads\n(the hallway cover with Brain at front)\nDecember 3, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl december's children (and everybody's)\n(the hallway cover with Brain at front)\n\nThis new remastered SACD is the July 30, 1965 - U.S. London Records vinyl out of our heads release. This version of included include the following tracks that were not to be on the U.K. release: The Last Time, I'm All Right, Satisfaction, Play With Fire, Spider And The Fly, and One More Try. The U.K. version added She Said Yeah, Talkin' Bout You, Oh Baby, Heart Of Stone, and I'm Free.\n\nNote: ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein became their manager in the 70s. The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever). But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material. With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio. I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.\n\nYou must buy all 3 releases to get all the tracks, although if you bought the 2 U.S. releases + the earlier U.S. release The Rolling Stones, Now! you would get everything on this U.K. Out Of Our Heads release.\n\nHere is a listing of which tracks are on which release:\nU.S. Out Of Our Heads tracks\n.....The Last Time\n.....I'm All Right\n.....Satisfaction\n.....Play With Fire\n.....The Spider And The Fly\n.....One More Try\nU.S. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks\n.....Mercy Mercy\n.....Hitch Hike\n.....That's How Strong My Love Is\n.....Good Times\n.....Cry To Me\n.....The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\nU.K. Out Of Our Heads tracks\n.....Oh, Baby (we got a good thing going)\n.....Heart Of Stone\nU.K. Out Of Our Heads &amp; U.S. December's Children tracks\n.....She Said Yeah\n.....Gotta Get Away\n.....Talkin' `Bout You\nU.S. December's Children tracks\n.....I'm Free\n.....You Better Move On\n.....Look What You've Done\n.....The Singer Not The Song\n.....Route 66\n.....Get Off Of My Cloud\n.....As Tears Go By\n.....Blue Turns To Grey\n.....I'm Moving On\n\nThe album includes the most famous of all Stones tracks (Satisfaction) as well as The Last Time (one of their most enduring compositions).
