But the Old Hunger is the most powerful entity in the Galaxy, and it's not a good idea to wake him up... or to by-pass his invincible herald, Stormfront! Meanwhile, Vance Astro has encountered a Guardian that he forgot ever existed, and she's none too happy about his memory blank. Time to make friends again fast... before the A-Sentience gestalt of The Stark destroys them all! Cosmic action and mind-blowing SF adventure!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b1eaaf5f526a456e81d76d1526c97f29d41fa9","amp;dn":"Guardians+3000+005+%282015%29+%28Digital%29+%28Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b1eaaf5f526a456e81d76d1526c97f29d41fa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,177,234,175,95,82,106,69,110,129,215,109,21,38,201,127,41,212,31,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
