The recipe for happily-ever-after? Start with one middle-class white girl in 1976. Add in her longing for love and acceptance, another middle-class white girl, a huge dollop of gossip, and excruciating peer and family pressure. Stir in youthful travel abroad, a Berkeley education, and a foray into paganism, drugs, marriage, and divorce. Whip until frothy with interracial and bisexual affairs, relationship violence, and exploration of multicultural mores. Season with salsa dancing. Temper with a segue into Mormonism. Decorate with a Temple wedding and garnish with motherhood to three adopted siblings. And what you have is a memoir capable of sating anyone's need for a great read. From shame to self-acceptance, from sexual ambiguity to definitive choice, from skepticism to belief, Donna Carol Voss's journey from childhood through marriage and motherhood is both unique and universal, a story that will resonate long after the last page is read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ef7b905505962f8adef7564939fe6e1ef2f03c","amp;dn":"One+of+Everything+-+Voss%2C+Donna+Carol+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ef7b905505962f8adef7564939fe6e1ef2f03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,239,123,144,85,5,150,47,138,222,247,86,73,57,254,110,30,242,240,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
