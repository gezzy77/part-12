There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and everything Mother Nature can throw at you.\r\nThere is no hand holding! The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive.\r\nThe first part of Story Modeâ€™s Season One launches in Spring 2016, with the entirety of Season One being released episodically over the remainder of 2016. Players will take on the dual roles of bush pilot Will Mackenzie, and doctor Astrid Greenwood, as they both struggle to survive the aftermath of the â€œFirst Flareâ€ event, which has brought modern civilization to its knees.\r\nRead More: http://hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark-story-mode-teaser/\r\nMonitor your Calorie count, Hunger and Thirst, Fatigue, and Body Temperature.\r\nOver 30 square kms of wilderness to explore with dynamic weather, wildlife and time-of-day.\r\nCollect over 100 gear items and learn how to hunt, harvest, craft, build fires and live off of the land on a quest for survival.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista/ 7 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: Dual-Core Inte i5 CPU @ 2GHz+ \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Intel 4xxx Series w/ 512MB VRAM or better \r\nStorage: 1 GB available space \r\nSound Card: Any on-board chip will work. \r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista/ 7 / 8 / 10 \r\nProcessor: Intel i7 CPU @ 2.6GHz or higher \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: nVidia GTX 555 w/ 1GB VRAM or better \r\nStorage: 1 GB available space \r\nSound Card: Ideally, something with Surround capabilities. \r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90abffc1007e1d16bce1c00300fea7534831c2f9","amp;dn":"The+Long+Dark+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90abffc1007e1d16bce1c00300fea7534831c2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,171,255,193,0,126,29,22,188,225,192,3,0,254,167,83,72,49,194,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
