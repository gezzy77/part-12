Scene of \naction is the Soviet Union. Leading Soviet scientists start a big experiment\nthat alter human physiology and mentality in order to create super humans\ncapable of building bright future and communism all over the world. But \nsomething goes wrong. As a result the whole city, where that experiment took\nplace, goes on a rampage. The majority of citizens died, and those who \nsurvived turned into hideous mutants - the only inhabitants of deserted \nstreets. You Are Empty immerses you in an exaggerated dark and obscure \natmosphere of Soviet totalitarianism. Fighting against mutants, that \nobtained super power after the experiment was carried out, the main hero \ntries to gain an understanding of what's happening around and save the day.\n\n1.
