Thought Problems in Mathematics and Physics \n\nby Keith Kendig \n\n  \n# ISBN-13: 9780883853399 \n# Publisher: Mathematical Association of America\n# Publication date: 2/29/2008\n# Pages: 390\n\n\nThis collection of problems drawn from mathematics and the real world reveals just how much can be learned by using everyday common sense. Its easily understandable style will hook school students and professional mathematicians alike.\n\nThe more than 250 questions cover a wide range of classical mathematics and physics, with a solution and explanation provided for each one. A generous sprinkling of boxes appear throughout the text containing historical asides or little-known facts, which help make the book a starting point for some interesting discussions.\n\nThe problems themselves can easily turn into serious debate-starters, and the book will find a natural home in the classroom. Often a single concrete problem represents an introduction to a more general concept or method of solution that the student will encounter later on. Conversely, a quick, common-sense solution to a problem can represent a surprising alternative to applying the standard but more lengthy technique\n\n\nContents:\n========\n\n1.  What do you think?
