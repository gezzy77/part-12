But the chances of saving this dealÃ¢â‚¬â€and her careerÃ¢â‚¬â€look pretty slim when she finds the sexy party boy Ã¢â‚¬Å“shooting the curlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with two beach bunnies.\nDylan is finally getting back on track, and the next big event would put him over the topÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being held in San Amaro, where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be forced to watch his best friends Matt and Corey tie the knot and move on without him.\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to keep that from happening, including taking shameless advantage of a tropical cycloneÃ¢â‚¬â€three days cut off from civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â€to distract the lovely Brooke into his bed.\nDespite her moment or three of weakness, Brooke wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be deterred. And suddenly Dylan finds himself facing a lot of thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€his hometown, his past, and something he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see coming.
