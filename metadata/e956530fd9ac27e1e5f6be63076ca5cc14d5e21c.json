That song, a cover of Robbie Robertson's &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&quot; is just one of the many surprises on Blessed Are... Once again using some of Nashville's finest pickers and songwriters, Baez runs the gamut of such influences as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Mickey Newberry, Jesse Winchester, Stevie Wonder and, of course, herself, while sounding nothing more than like Joan Baez always has. Great music, and a lot of it, too, for when it was released on vinyl, it was a double album with a special 7&quot; single included. Altogether, 22 tracks of some of Joan's finest. \n\nJoan Baez - Blessed Are...\nRelease:\t1971-08\nCountry:\tUS\nType:\tAlbum\nLength:\t76:54\n\nTracklist:\n1.\tBlessed Are...
