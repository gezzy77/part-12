Now a little older and wiser, she's ready to return to the Blue Heron Winery, her family's vineyard, to confront the ghosts of her past, and maybe enjoy a glass of red. After all, there's some great scenery thereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nLike Levi Cooper, the local police chiefÃ¢â‚¬â€and best friend of her former fiancÃƒÂ©. There's a lot about Levi that Faith never noticed, and it's not just those deep green eyes. The only catch is she's having a hard time forgetting that he helped ruin her wedding all those years ago. If she can find a minute amidst all her family drama to stop and smell the rosÃƒÂ©, she just might find a reason to stay at Blue Heron, and finish that walk down the aisle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d24918e1824d8a1a03a394abd6e6dc9cf420207","amp;dn":"Kristan+Higgins+-+The+Best+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d24918e1824d8a1a03a394abd6e6dc9cf420207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,36,145,142,24,36,216,161,160,58,57,74,189,110,109,201,207,66,2,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
