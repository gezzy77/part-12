Two years ago Cuba announced the most sweeping and radical economic reforms the country has seen in decades. From ending state rationing to cutting one million public-sector jobs, one of the last communist bastions in the world has begun rolling back the state on an unprecedented scale. Simon Reeve meets ordinary Cubans whose lives are being transformed, from the owners of fledgling businesses to the newly rich estate agents selling properties worth up to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£750,000.\n\nSimon gets under the skin of a colourful and vibrant country famous for its hospitality and humour and asks if this new economic openness could lead to political liberalisation in a totalitarian country with a poor human rights record. Will Cuba be able to maintain the positive aspects of its long isolation under socialism - low crime, top-notch education and one of the best health systems in the world - while embracing what certainly looks like capitalism? Is this the last chance to see Cuba before it becomes just like any other country?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/7899/cubabbcscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/7899/cubabbcscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/8389/cubabbcscreen1.jpg http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3623/cubabbcscreen2.jpg http://img803.imageshack.us/img803/1333/cubabbcscreen3.jpg http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7210/cubabbcscreen4.jpg http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/930/cubabbcscreen5.jpg http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/3256/cubabbcscreen6.jpg http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4410/cubabbcscreen7.jpg http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/9450/cubabbcscreen8.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1530 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pfvns\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c4f5f043b5fbd3215654434f89c8cae7968d81","amp;dn":"BBC.This.World.2012.Cuba.with.Simon.Reeve.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c4f5f043b5fbd3215654434f89c8cae7968d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,196,245,240,67,181,251,211,33,86,84,67,79,137,200,202,231,150,141,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
