Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features.\n\nThis yearÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s version allows you to take control of any club in more than 50 nations across the world and includes all of EuropeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s biggest leagues as well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and staff.\n\nAs well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are now new ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience.\nKey Features:\n\nNEW TO CAREER MODEÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª\n\nMatch Engine\nThe 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the playersÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.\n\nWeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more realistic and weÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve made the whole experience more televisual by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle.\n\nManager Roles\nAnother notable difference is the significant restructure of the managerÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that weÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.\n\nIn addition to this, weÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve also increased the number of specialist coaching roles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to complain about boardroom interference ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ although that particular option should probably be used sparingly.\n\nAnd much moreÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª\nA brand new training system, improved international management, tones in press conferences &amp; a new user interface.\n\nPlus over 900 other new features!\n\nPC System Requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/W7/W8\nProcessor: XP: 1.6GHz or Faster.
