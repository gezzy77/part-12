The recommended version of Java is 1.6.0_25+. Windows. Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 &amp; 8, 32/64 are supported.\n\nMac OS X. Due to certain restrictions with the Apple MIDI loopback driver, IAC bus use is recommended only from Java 1.6.0_25. Liquid Notes works with Mac OS X 10.5 or higher.\n\nNote: Since Liquid Notes works on operating system level and is listed to the outside as a MIDI device via virtual busses, it should operate flawlessly with any commercially available sequencers. This compatibility was so far tested with Cubase (Windows versions 5, 6, and 7) and Logic (versions 8 and 9), Live, Sonar X1, and Pro Tools (from version 8 ). Further tests are planned with more sequencers.\nSee special instructions for MIDI export from Live on page 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  You need WinRar or other extractor of your\n   choice to extract the rar file\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Install\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  copy the crack from crack folder and apply into\n    installation dir.\n\n     Note: Welcome GUI may be blank.
