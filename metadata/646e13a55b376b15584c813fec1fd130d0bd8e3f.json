Release: 1995.\n\n\nThe single-disc, 29-track compilation Puzzles collects all of Ed Bruce's RCA recordings from the late '60s, including &quot;Blue Denim Eyes,&quot; &quot;By Route of New Orleans,&quot; &quot;Walker's Woods,&quot; &quot;Last Train to Clarksville,&quot; &quot;Painted Girls and Wine,&quot; &quot;Memphis Morning,&quot; &quot;Why Can't I Come Home,&quot; &quot;Ninety Seven More to Go,&quot; &quot;Give Me More Than You Can Take,&quot; &quot;Something Else to Mess Your Mind&quot; and no less than three versions of the title track. While this material is not among Bruce's best-known, it is among his best. Though the duplicate versions of some tracks can be tedious -- &quot;Puzzles&quot; is presented in three versions, there are two takes of &quot;I'd Be Best Leaving You,&quot; there are both dubbed and undubbed versions of &quot;Painted Girls and Wine&quot; and &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; -- Puzzles nevertheless is an excellent way to become acquainted with a fine, underappreciated talent. ~ Thom Owens\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646e13a55b376b15584c813fec1fd130d0bd8e3f","amp;dn":"Ed+Bruce+-+Puzzles+%5B1966-1968%5D+Bear+Family+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646e13a55b376b15584c813fec1fd130d0bd8e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,110,19,165,91,55,107,21,88,76,129,63,236,31,209,48,208,189,142,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
