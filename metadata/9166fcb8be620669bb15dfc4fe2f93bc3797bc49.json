It ran for four series from 1984 to 1987, each series being four episodes long. It was written by Tony Sarchet and produced by Paul Mayhew-Archer.\n\nDavid Lander's investigative technique was usually somewhere between the questionable and the illegal - during each episode he also displayed some degree of ineptitude or lack of understanding in the subject matter he was reporting on. As a result, he usually found himself being set upon physically by those concerned. The programme heavily spoofed the style of topical radio reporters such as John Waite of Face the Facts and Roger Cook, a Radio 4 presenter who went on to television work such as The Cook Report.\n\n\nCast:\nStephen Fry\nTony Robinson \nFelicity Montagu \nStephen Frost\nMark Arden, \nHarry Enfield\nDawn French\nBrenda Blethyn\n\n\nDelve Special - S01 - E01 - The Shifton Scandal\nDelve Special - S01 - E02 - The Shifton Scandal\nDelve Special - S01 - E03 - The Shifton Scandal\nDelve Special - S01 - E04 - The Shifton Scandal\n\nDelve Special - S02 - E01 - The Archibold Cox Gallery Robbery\nDelve Special - S02 - E02 - Whose Baby\nDelve Special - S02 - E03 - The Secret Dis-Service\nDelve Special - S02 - E04 - The Nicholson Story\n\nDelve Special - S03 - E01 - A Rocket For Defence\nDelve Special - S03 - E02 - Cowboys\nDelve Special - S03 - E03 - Food For Thought\nDelve Special - S03 - E04 - City Limits\n\nDelve Special - S04 - E01 - There's One Born Every Minute\nDelve Special - S04 - E02 - Bitter Harvest\nDelve Special - S04 - E03 - The Not-So-Supergrasses\nDelve Special - S04 - E04 - Resurrection Of St Jerome\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9166fcb8be620669bb15dfc4fe2f93bc3797bc49","amp;dn":"Delve+Special+-+S01+to+04+-+%5B+Stephen+Fry+%5D+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9166fcb8be620669bb15dfc4fe2f93bc3797bc49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,102,252,184,190,98,6,105,187,21,223,196,254,47,147,188,55,151,188,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
