It built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, \nbut lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure \nin 1968 of founding member, principal composer and lyricist, Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moons \nthemes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by \nBarrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\nThe suite was developed during live performances and was premiered several months before studio \nrecording began. The new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios \nin London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack \nrecording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of \nrecorded interviews with the band's road crew and others provided the philosophical quotations used throughout \nEngineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, and \nthe recruitment of non-lexical performer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve features a prism that \nrepresents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist Richard Wright's request \nfor a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart for one week. \nIt subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, longer than any other album in history\nWith an estimated 50 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the \nbest-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its \nentirety by several other acts. It spawned two singles, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. In addition to its commercial success\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently \nranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.\n\n\n   1.
