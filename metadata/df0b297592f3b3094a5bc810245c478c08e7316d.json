PDF files preserve documents formats independent of software, hardware, or operating system used to generate the original file. They can be opened, read and printed by many free PDF readers available on the web, and viewed on operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Unix variants.\n\nTechnology:\nPDF format is the best document format for long-term digital archival. Often software becomes obsolete, rendering some documents unreadable by current technology. Widely published formats, such as PDF, are more future proof that proprietary formats such as MS Word. In 50 years time, even if PDF's are not used anymore, all you need is the PDF specification and you can have a viewer developed to read your documents.\n\nSearchable:\nPDF has the ability to store text in a searchable form.\n\nBrowsers:\nPDF files can be viewed within Netscape and Internet Explorer. These files can then be saved for off-line use or printed. This makes for easy use within an intranet or website.\n\nColour and Size:\nPDF files enable sharp, colour-precise printing on most printers with precise onscreen colour match regardless of monitor brand. Users can magnify documents up to 800% without the loss of clarity in text or graphics. PDF files can be optimized and are often smaller than conventional document formats.\n\npdfMachine features:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Print to create PDF\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PDF Editing and mark-up\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Open any PDF\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Comment PDF\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multilingual font support\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mail Integration\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Small File Sizes\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Voice annotations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Text annotations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PDF Stationery\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Text and image watermarks\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Security Encryption\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Active URLs\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hyperlinks\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ N-Up Printing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ MS Office Integration\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ MS IE Integration\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Network Installations\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bookmark Editing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Word Mail Merge\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Digital Signatures\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Parameter parsing\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Scanning Support\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Custom toolbar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Terminal Server\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Set Next Action\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Set Document properties\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiple Print Profiles / Multiple Printers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP/Vista x64 drivers\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ File embedding/attaching\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ PDF/A\n\nSupported Platforms:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows 2000 / 2003 / 2008 / XP / Vista / 7 (all x64 platforms are supported)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Microsoft Word 2000 / 2002 (XP) / 2003 / 2007 / 2010\n\nChanges in version 14.24, 20-May-2011:\nFeatures:\n* support for SSL / TLS / SMTP mail, eg gmail\nFixes:\n* Digital Signatures for last page\n* No longer crashes in Vista when swapping page orientation for a stamp\n* Digital Signature preview changes orientation with change in page orientation\n* No longer crashes when a stamp is inserted for all pages on a single page PDF (Win 2008 x64 only)\n* No longer crashes when saving a sticky note.
