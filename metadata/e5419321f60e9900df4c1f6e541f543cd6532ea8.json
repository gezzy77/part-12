The Who were at a career crossraods, they were known mainly as a singles band but this project launched them as a serious 'albums band' and has now sold over 20 million copies as well as regularly turning up in lists of the most influential albums of all time. Tommy is now available as a new Super Deluxe Edition.\n\n\n Tommy Super Deluxe Edition features the orignial album re-mastered along with a wealth of previously unheard material including 20 demos from Pete Townshend's archive and also a full live performance of Tommy from 1969 taken from tapes that infamously Townshend asked the band's sound engineer to burn. 18 of the previously unheard and thought to be lost live tracks were taken from a live show at the Capital Theatre, Ottowa, Canada on October the 15th, 1969. Three others, &quot;I'm Free&quot;, &quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot; and &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; were lost due to tape reels being changed during the show so are taken from later shows of the same era. As discussed at length in Pete Townshend's autobiography the tapes were all supposed to be destroyed but were kept by long time Who sound man Bob Pridden despite Pete's instructions.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\nPart I - Original Album Version\n 01.
