Ellisson is the USA Today Bestselling author of the NYT Bestselling book, Vanilla on Top, the bestselling V V Inn series, and several erotica shorts. She lives in northern Virginia with her husband, two children, two dogs, and a fluffy black cat who makes her sneeze. Unlike most full-time authors, she's also battling severe chronic illness. \n\nC.J. works daily to put her Lupus into remission and continues to fight numerous bacterial infections while her immune system slowly attacks her body. She turned to writing when she could no longer work outside the home and claims the escape of penning contemporary fantasy, erotica, and erotic romance has helped save her sanity.\n\nGenre: Paranormal / Romance / Fantasy\n\nDeath's Servant #0.1\nJonathan Winchester has clashed with his alpha one too many times. After another argument he leaves the Manitoba pack, his only home since the werewolf attack that changed his life. He returns to his home state of Virginia to start a new life free of pack politics. Jon finds work and meets a young waitress, Raine, who appears to be a lone werewolf, too.\nAs their relationship progresses, JonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embroiled in more intrigue than he bargained for and a danger bigger than he can handle. He's running scared until his own alpha tendencies surface, making him unable to leave the pretty werewolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems behind. The young man is desperate to save RaineÃ¢â‚¬â€even if his efforts may lead him straight to death.\nJourney along in this first prequel novel involving the favorite characters from the bestselling V V Inn series. Written at reader demand, this stand-alone story explains how the beloved Jonathan came to serve the deadly redheaded vampire, Dria.\n\nThe Hunt #2\nVivian thinks she can control every aspect of a deadly game with her usual manipulationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but what if she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t? Journey along, in this next installment of The V V Inn series, for a wild ride as the tale is told through the eyes of all her new seethe members.\nSeven vampires and seven werewolves pay to hunt a supernatural criminal across the cold, vast grounds of an Alaskan resort. The one to catch her, and live through the encounter, will increase their power by feasting on hers.\nThe tiny vampire they track is more than she appears, however. To escape a fate of ten years in silver chains, she'll do anything to survive the weeklong excursion. This time, the darkness holds more than just the stinging bite of the ArcticÃ¢â‚¬â€it holds death.\n\nBig Game #3\nIn this much-anticipated third installment of the V V Inn series, our sexy couple journeys to Argentina, bringing half their seethe along for the ride. Vivian and Rafe venture into the Seat of Darkness, the Tribunal's base, to uncover who's plotting against them and why. From a cold, windy island off the southern Argentine coast, to the decadence of Buenos Aires, the group has plenty to keep their attention--seductive twins, deadly games, and a bunch of bloodsucking fiends who hate our much-loved, despotic innkeeper enough to see her dead. Asa and Jon remain in Alaska, to manage the famous inn as it opens doors to a new type of guest. Visiting werewolves go on their first exploration of the property, looking for big game--hormones run high and shots ring out across the tundra. Soon, the hunters become the hunted and the peaceful getaway resembles a battleground. How many will survive the next five days and will they ever be the same again?\n\nDeath Times Two #3.5\nThe V V Inn has a ghost problem. When the lurking specters draw the attention of Constantine, head of Grim Reaper Services, he calls in the only local who can return the remote resort to its former tranquility, Lisa CarronÃ¢â‚¬â€resident Alaskan reaper.\nStill new to the death gig, Lisa accepts the job. After all, how much trouble could one ghost be? Once at the hotel, she learns that not only is the inn full of the dearly departed, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also be working for vampires. Throw in Asa, a young vamp hot enough to melt the Arctic ice, and Lisa realizes sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way out of her element.\nAsa didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what to expect when told a reaper would be working on the property, but Lisa certainly wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it. Blond and curvy, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very easy on the eyes. Tasked with helping her, Asa soon realizes that not only can she provide the dead a peaceful passing, but offer him solace in a way no other woman can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6bd93d25a6dc840e43bfad893ac0fcedf1edaf","amp;dn":"The+V+V+Inn+Series+by+C.J.+Ellisson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6bd93d25a6dc840e43bfad893ac0fcedf1edaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,107,217,61,37,166,220,132,14,67,191,173,137,58,192,252,237,241,237,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
