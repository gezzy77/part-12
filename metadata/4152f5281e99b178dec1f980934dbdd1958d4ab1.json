With some advanced functions, formatting, and filters, you can create these heat maps right in Microsoft Excel. The techniques shown in this course transform Excel from a basic spreadsheet program into a dynamic and powerful analytics tool for heat mapping.â€¨â€¨Chris Dutton provides hands-on examples designed to showcase why certain functionsâ€”DATEVALUE, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, and moreâ€”are so valuable to mapping data. He also shows how to use conditional color-scale formatting to map your data matrix, and find different ways to examine the same data with different criteria, using dynamic filters. The course wraps up with a few finishing touches to make your heat map even more useful and engaging, including a preview of what's possible with the Power Map addin.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tSetting up the heat map project\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing functions such as WEEKDAY and VLOOKUP\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding conditional statements\r\n\tâ€¢\tFormatting with the color-scale feature\r\n\tâ€¢\tAggregating data with SUM\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding dynamic filters\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating formula-based formatting rules\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding additional analytics\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4152f5281e99b178dec1f980934dbdd1958d4ab1","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Excel+Workshop%3A+Building+a+Dynamic+Heat+Map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4152f5281e99b178dec1f980934dbdd1958d4ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,82,245,40,30,153,177,120,222,193,249,128,147,77,189,209,149,141,74,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
