Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine, replaces his twin brother, a scientist trained as an avatar operator who was murdered in a robbery. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement and assigns him as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and scientist Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) on their expedition to collect biological samples and data in the forest, Jake's avatar is attacked by a jungle predator thanator. Fleeing for his life, Jake strays from the rest of the group and gets lost in the forest. Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na'vi, stumbles upon Jake and reluctantly rescues him from Pandora's wildlife. Seeing portents from Eywa, she takes him to her clan's dwelling, Hometree; there, Jake meets Neytiri's father, clan chief Eytukan (Wes Studi). Neytiri's mother Mo'at (C. C. H. Pounder), the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to teach the &quot;warrior dreamwalker&quot; their ways.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy\n\nRelease date: 17 December 2009 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nSam Worthington\nZoe Saldana\nStephen Lang\nMichelle Rodriguez\nJoel David Moore\nGiovanni Ribisi\nSigourney Weaver\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Avatar 2009 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:2757.17 MiB\nDuration:2h 41mn\nOverall bit rate:2 384 Kbps\nSubtitles: Arabic,Danish,Dutch,English,French,German,Portuguese,Russian,Spanish,Swedish,Vietnamese\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-06-28 15:30:57\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/09659211092756045345.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/09659211092756045345.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/42414213602791667153.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/42414213602791667153.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61173291063573116647.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61173291063573116647.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/32579022112900363395.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/32579022112900363395.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/66226766287405744615.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/66226766287405744615.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25896064478990447423.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25896064478990447423.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c20977fc6f9ba91fa218ad56820e4420b83ba0","amp;dn":"Avatar+2009+720p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c20977fc6f9ba91fa218ad56820e4420b83ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,194,9,119,252,111,155,169,31,162,24,173,86,130,14,68,32,184,59,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
