Its Five Singles Were &quot;Babylon,&quot; &quot;Please Forgive Me,&quot; &quot;This Year's Love,&quot; &quot;Sail Away,&quot; And &quot;Say Hello Wave Goodbye.&quot; When Released In The U.S. David Gray Was Nominated For The 2002 Grammy Award For Best New Artist.\n\nAmazon.Co.Uk Review\n\nA Major Artist In Ireland, David Gray Has A Loyal But Somewhat Smaller Following Throughout The Rest Of The World. Since His 1994 Debut Album A Century Ends, He Has Consistently Produced Quality, Folk-Tinged Songs That Showcase His One Major Talent--A Raw Yet Melodic Voice. White Ladder Marks Something Of A Departure From His Usual Fare, As It Sees Him Embracing A More Modern Sound, Adding Interesting Beats And Electronic Sounds To The More Traditional Acoustic Guitar And Piano. In Trying To Widen His Appeal, He Risks Alienating His Fan Base, But Tracks Like &quot;This Year's Love&quot; And &quot;My Oh My&quot; Should Keep Everybody Happy.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Please Forgive Me\n[02] Babylon\n[03] My Oh My\n[04] We're Not Right\n[05] Silver Lining\n[06] White Ladder\n[07] This Year's Love\n[08] Sail Away\n[09] Say Hello, Wave Goodbye \n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 00h:46m:11s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 110 mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.0.2.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t- iht Records Chrysalis Music\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.davidgray.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/DavidGray \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/David+Gray \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d49355e07034d879146b98a3774bd20ea0357ef2","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+White+Ladder+-+David+Gray+-++110mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d49355e07034d879146b98a3774bd20ea0357ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,147,85,224,112,52,216,121,20,107,152,163,119,75,210,14,160,53,126,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
