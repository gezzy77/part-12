For the Stones and their fans, this marked a return to many long-overlooked live favorites and a chance for the iconic British group to show the younger generations how rock &amp; roll was meant to be played. On this double-disc live set, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (both bordering on age 60 during this tour) lead the band through more than 20 classics with their time-defying energy and showmanship intact.\n\nIn addition to a slinky &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and a triumphant, piano-driven &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want,&quot; the Stones break out a number of tunes not often performed in concert, including a jam-heavy, 10-minute version of &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and a twangy, rollicking take on &quot;Rocks Off.&quot; For a few surprises, Richards takes the lead vocal on Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness of You,&quot; Sheryl Crow adds her distinctive voice to &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; and soul legend Solomon Burke lends his powerful pipes to his classic &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.&quot; A vibrant, dynamic outing, LIVE LICKS reveals the Stones to be in excellent form a full four decades after their first London gigs.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD 1:\n\n01.
