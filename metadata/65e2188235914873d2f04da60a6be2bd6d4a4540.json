Sigel, editor - International Exposure: Perspectives on Modern European Pornography, 1800Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2000 (Rutgers University Press, 2005).\n\nISBN: 9780813535180 | 296 pages | PDF\n\n&quot;International Exposure&quot; demonstrates the wealth of desires woven into the fabric of European history: desires about empire and nation, about self and other, about plenty and dearth. By documenting the diverse meanings of pornography, senior scholars from across disciplines show the ways that sexuality became central to the individual, to the nation, and to the transnational character of modern society.\n\nThe ten essays in the volume engage a rich array of topics, including obscenity in the German states, censorship in FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Third Republic, &quot;she-male&quot; internet porn, the rise of incestuous longings in England, the place of the Hungarian video revolution in the global market, and the politics of pornography in Russia. Taken together, the essays illustrate the latest approaches to content, readership, form, and delivery in modern European pornography.\n\nA substantial discussion of the broad history and state of the field complements the ten in-depth case studies that examine a wide range of sources from literature to magazines, video to the internet. By tackling the highbrow and lowdown of the pornographic form, this volume lays the groundwork for the next surge of studies in the field.\n\nContributors: John Phillips, Maryna Romanets, Eliot Borenstein, Colette Colligan, Sarah Leonard, Katalin Szoverfy Milter, Joseph Slade, Clarissa Smith, Annie Stora-Lamarre\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;This collection makes an important and pioneering contribution toward demonstrating the historically and culturally specific nature of pornography and erotica.&quot; -- Lesley Hall\n\n&quot;This sophisticated, even witty collection goes beyond tired old debates to provide compelling and surprising insights into national cultures of pornography.&quot; -- Anna Clark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e2188235914873d2f04da60a6be2bd6d4a4540","amp;dn":"Perspectives+on+Modern+European+Pornography%2C+1800-2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e2188235914873d2f04da60a6be2bd6d4a4540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,226,24,130,53,145,72,115,210,240,77,166,10,107,226,189,109,74,69,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
