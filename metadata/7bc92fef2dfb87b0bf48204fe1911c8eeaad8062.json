But Kestrel has other intentions.\r\n\r\nOne day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. Arinâ€™s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys himâ€”with unexpected consequences. Itâ€™s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin.\r\n\r\nBut he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc92fef2dfb87b0bf48204fe1911c8eeaad8062","amp;dn":"Marie+Rutkoski+-+The+Winners+Curse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc92fef2dfb87b0bf48204fe1911c8eeaad8062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,201,47,239,45,251,135,176,191,72,32,79,225,145,28,142,234,173,128,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
