In cabin getaways of the imagination, the cares of the world recede, time slows down, and the dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pace is set by leisure and quiet activities.\n\nCompact Cabins presents 62 design interpretations of the getaway dream, with something to please every taste. Best of all, these small footprint designs are affordable and energy efficient without skimping on comfort and style. The cabins range in size from a cozy 100 square feet to a more spacious but still economical 1,000 square feet, and all include sleeping accommodations, kitchen and bath facilities, and a heat source. Complete chapters on low-maintenance building materials, utilities and appliances, and alternative energy sources supply readers with the options for living efficiently in small spaces.\n\nFor every design, readers will find floor plans with detailed suggestions for designing the space for optimal use. These plans are flexible; many feature modular elements that can be mixed and matched to accommodate a particular ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs or hobbies. Features such as an outdoor fireplace, covered porch, or external storage locker might work nicely in several cabin designs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about enhancing and maximizing small spaces to suit individual needs and preferences.\n\nBuild small. In this time of uncertain energy costs, global warming, and tighter budgets, building small is a theme that resonates with second-home owners. Gerald Rowan shows readers how to achieve their cabin dreams on a small footprint.\n\n\n\nBy Gerald Rowan\nPublished by Storey Publishing in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 216 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:006f52e0f8f091696c08a74049626b1fb011604e","amp;dn":"Compact+Cabins+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"006f52e0f8f091696c08a74049626b1fb011604e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,111,82,224,248,240,145,105,108,8,167,64,73,98,107,31,176,17,96,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
