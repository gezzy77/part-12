A remarkably expressive and intimate record, it's a work of consummate craftsmanship. Always a superior pop composer, King reaches even greater heights as a performer; new songs like the hits &quot;It's Too Late&quot; and &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; rank solidly with past glories, while songs like &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; take on added resonance when delivered in her own warm, compelling voice. With its reliance on pianos and gentle drumming, Tapestry is a light and airy work on its surface, occasionally skirting the boundaries of jazz, but it's also an intensely emotional record, the songs confessional and direct; in its time it connected with listeners like few records before it, and it remains an illuminating experience decades later. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img223.imageshack.us/img223/2133/carolekingtapestryfrontpx9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img223.imageshack.us/img223/2133/carolekingtapestryfrontpx9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n01.
