Introduction to Engineering Statistics and Six Sigma contains precise descriptions of all of the many related methods and details case studies showing how they have been applied in engineering and business to achieve millions of dollars of savings. Specifically, the methods introduced include many kinds of design of experiments (DOE) and statistical process control (SPC) charting approaches, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), formal optimization, genetic algorithms, gauge reproducibility and repeatability (R&amp;R), linear regression, neural nets, simulation, quality function deployment (QFD) and Taguchi methods. A major goal of the book is to help the reader to determine exactly which methods to apply in which situation and to predict how and when the methods might not be effective. Illustrative examples are provided for all the methods presented and exercises based on case studies help the reader build associations between techniques and industrial problems. A glossary of acronyms provides familiarity with six sigma terminology and solutions to homework and practice exams are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a712be891b8cfa945ed2dec55fc560b53ed8bb1b","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2006%5D+Introduction+to+Engineering+Statistics+and+Six+Sigm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a712be891b8cfa945ed2dec55fc560b53ed8bb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,18,190,137,27,140,250,148,94,210,222,197,95,197,96,181,62,216,187,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
