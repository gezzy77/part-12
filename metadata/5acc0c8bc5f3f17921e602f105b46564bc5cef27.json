A trailblazing traditionalist of the '60s and '70s, Pride broke the color barrier for popular country music Ã¢â‚¬â€ there had been African-American country singers long before him; Ray Charles blurred the boundaries between country and soul a few years before him, and Pride had peers like Stoney Edwards, but Charley was the first black country superstar Ã¢â‚¬â€ due in part to his easy, friendly way with a song. McCoy has a similar amiable way with a tune and, as a singer of Filipino descent, he bucked country tradition even as he adhered to it. Pride: A Tribute to Charley Pride puts all this into relief while also being quite a good listen in its own right. As a traditionalist paying respect to a traditionalist, McCoy doesn't play around with the arrangements in the slightest Ã¢â‚¬â€ he even seems indebted to the sound of Pride's recordings, not the early ones of the '60s but the gleaming overproductions of the late '70s and early '80s Ã¢â‚¬â€ but these are terrific songs performed well, by both McCoy and his guests Raul Malo (who is on &quot;I'm Just Me&quot;), Darius Rucker (&quot;Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'&quot;), and Trace Adkins (&quot;Roll On Mississippi&quot;). There's almost a funhouse mirror quality here, with McCoy looking back on Pride who was looking back on Hank Williams (the presence of &quot;Kaw-Liga&quot; underscores this), but that's part of the appeal of Pride: each bygone era it salutes is worth celebrating. \n\n\nArtist...............: Neal McCoy\nAlbum................: Pride: A Tribute to Charley Pride\nGenre................: Country\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: NMR \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3 \nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
