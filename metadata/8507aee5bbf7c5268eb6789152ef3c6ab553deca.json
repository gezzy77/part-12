Unlike other products, it can analyze the data packets (where they come from, where they go, which port and protocol they use). This makes it possible to distinguish between local and internet traffic for example. BWMeter can also be used for traffic control by setting a speed limit for all kinds of connections or restricting access of applications to certain internet sites. It creates statistics for all computers in your network, measuring and displaying all LAN traffic as well as download and upload from the internet. You can even define filters which show your transfer with certain internet addresses (e.g. to see how much data you download from your favorite news server). BWMeter is ideal for home users to get an overview of how much bandwidth they use, as well as small to large businesses, where one computer can control the traffic and maintain the statistics of downloaded and uploaded data of all computers in the network. The product is easy to configure and offers a rich set of options and features for beginners as well as experts and network administrators.\n\n\nTechnology\n- BWMeter is based on WinpkFilter network drivers.\n\nSystem Requirements\n- BWMeter Supports Windows XP, Windows XP x64, Windows Vista, Windows Vista x64, Windows 7, Windows 7 x64, Windows Home Server, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 x64, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 x64\n- For older operating systems (Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4 and 2000), please download version 3 of BWMeter here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.desksoft.com/OldVersions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.desksoft.com/OldVersions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall Notes\n1.
