Criminological research areas include the incidence and forms of crime as well as its causes and consequences. They also include social and governmental regulations and reactions to crime. Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in the behavioural sciences, drawing especially on the research of sociologists and psychologists, as well as on writings in law. This book presents leading research from around the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3051b61c682f4530e9854e643e545bb0c89fceb","amp;dn":"Criminology+Research+Focus+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3051b61c682f4530e9854e643e545bb0c89fceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,5,27,97,198,130,244,83,14,152,84,230,67,229,69,187,12,137,252,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
