Checked my DVR and looky what we have. We'll miss you Billy.\n\nIn other news:\n&quot;Discovery Channel's PITCHMEN, the 12-part series that featured the late Billy Mays II and his business partner, Anthony 'Sully' Sullivan, will be back for a second season. Because of the success of the series first season, and as a tribute to Mays' legacy, the show will continue. PITCHMEN, which is produced by Original Productions, a division of Freemantle Media, took viewers behind the curtain into the billion dollar infomercial industry, as Mays and Sullivan helped everyday men and women bring their inventions to the masses. Discovery Channel is developing the format of season two with Mays' son, Billy Mays III, Anthony Sullivan and Thom Beers, CEO of Original Productions. More information will be announced as it becomes available. A premiere date for season two of PITCHMEN hasn't yet been set.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20ac509ddde448022ffdff85b4e0b7f8d48ed99","amp;dn":"Pitchmen.S01E13.A.Tribute.to.Billy.Mays.HDTV.XviD.%5Bgoat%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20ac509ddde448022ffdff85b4e0b7f8d48ed99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,10,197,9,221,222,68,128,34,255,223,248,91,78,11,127,141,72,237,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
