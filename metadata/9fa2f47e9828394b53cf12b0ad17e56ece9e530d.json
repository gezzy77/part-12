All-Ireland flute champion in the late eighties, and BBC Radio 2 Young Tradition Award winner in 1995, Michael has been playing with the celtic rock band Toss the Feathers for ten years and has several recordings out on the German-based Magnetic Music label. His duet album with fiddler Dezi Donnelly was reviewed in LT14, and now Michael has a solo album to add to the list.\n\n&quot;Morning Rory&quot; is forty-four minutes of joyous instrumental music, appropriately enough as it is named for Michael's first-born who had absolutely no words at the time! It's a young musician's album (Michael is now 25), with plenty of pace and excitement. To call it a solo album is misleading: Michael plays flutes, pipes and whistles amongst other things, and is joined by seven friends including half of Capercaillie. The result is a bit like the wilder moments of Planxty in the days of Matt Molloy and Liam O'Flynn: You can't get much better praise than that!\n\nThe first track is a virtuoso rendition of two traditional reels on pipes and flute: fast and furious, but perfectly controlled. Track 2 is a couple more reels, the second a McGoldrick composition, a little slower and sparser. Track 3 is three reels (getting the picture?) played with traditional wild abandon on flute and guitar, and in fact the final tune is a little too abandoned at times. If this was a live album, I'd be blaming the cups of tea at the interval. The next track is back in line, a beautiful rendition of the Andy Cutting air &quot;The History Man&quot;, nicely underpinned by the box-playing of Alan Kelly (I think).\n\nA set of jigs adds a new rhythm, including another of Michael's own tunes, and then it's back to reels. Track 7 is one of the best: two slip jigs, the first from the playing of Dervish and the second written for &quot;Baby Rory&quot; by the proud father, both great tunes taken at a lovely pace. The album ends with four sets of reels, all surprisingly different: several more McGoldrick compositions, some brilliant whistle-playing on Track 8 in particular, two fantastic examples of traditional flute-playing on Tracks 9 and 10 including the excellent &quot;Mulhaire's Reel&quot; (called &quot;Lavery's 2&quot; here), and a quirky final track which is the only trace of the rock'n'roll years.\n\nMy first impression of this album was excellent, and that hasn't changed with repeated listening. The sleeve notes are a bit home-made, but otherwise this is a totally polished product with loads of good music and nothing much to offend the traditionalists. If you see it, buy it.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/michael-mcgoldrick/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa2f47e9828394b53cf12b0ad17e56ece9e530d","amp;dn":"Michael+McGoldrick...Morning+Rory%281995%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa2f47e9828394b53cf12b0ad17e56ece9e530d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,162,244,126,152,40,57,75,83,207,18,176,173,23,229,110,206,158,83,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
