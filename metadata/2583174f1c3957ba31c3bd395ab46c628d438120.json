This is a different gaming experience: an opportunity to slow down, zone out and focus on a task thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenging but not stressful, a set of gentle puzzles for the mind and fingers to solve.\n\nThe goal of the game is to paint wooden sculptures by wrapping them in rope - a task that may sound simple but has surprising complexity. Each of the levels presents a spatial puzzle that becomes obvious through inspection. Some levels feature paint bombs that are helpful in covering complex areas of the object.\n\nZen Bound 2 is a calm and meditative gameplay experience, with tactile, dusty visuals and a sublime, enveloping soundtrack by the sensational electronic artist Ã¢â‚¬ËœGhost MonkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n============================================\nInstructions:                              =\n============================================\n\n* Install\n* Play\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2583174f1c3957ba31c3bd395ab46c628d438120","amp;dn":"Zen+Bound+2+Full+v2.5.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2583174f1c3957ba31c3bd395ab46c628d438120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,131,23,79,28,57,87,186,49,195,189,57,90,180,108,98,141,67,129,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
