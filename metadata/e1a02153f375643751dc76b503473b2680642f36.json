Born in Texas, he dropped out of high school to enlist in the US Merchant Marine, serving for ten years before leaving to work in the electronics industry. At the end of World War II, Williams began writing fiction while living in San Francisco. The success of his backwoods noir Hill Girl (1951) allowed him to quit his job and write fulltime.\r\n\r\nWilliamsâ€™s clean and somewhat casual narrative style distinguishes his novelsâ€”which range from hard-boiled, small-town noir to suspense thrillers set at sea and in the Deep South. Although originally published by pulp fiction houses, his work won great critical acclaim, with Hell Hath No Fury (1953) becoming the first paperback original to be reviewed by legendary New York Times critic Anthony Boucher. Many of his novels were adapted for the screen, such as Dead Calm (published in 1963) and Donâ€™t Just Stand There! (published in 1966), for which Williams wrote the screenplay. Williams died in California in 1975.\r\n\r\nThe package include below novels :\r\n    Hill Girl (1951)\r\n    Big City Girl (1951)\r\n    River Girl (aka The Catfish Tangle) (1951)\r\n    Hell Hath No Fury (aka The Hot Spot) (1953)\r\n    Nothing in Her Way (1953)\r\n    Go Home, Stranger (1954)\r\n    A Touch of Death (aka Mix Yourself a Redhead; based on 1953 novella And Share Alike) (1954)\r\n    Scorpion Reef (aka Gulf Coast Girl; based on novella Flight to Nowhere) (1955)\r\n    The Big Bite (1956)\r\n    The Diamond Bikini (1956)\r\n    Girl Out Back (aka Operator; based on 1957 novella titled either Operator or Operation) (1958)\r\n    Talk of the Town (aka Stain of Suspicion; also condensed under that title) (1958)\r\n    All the Way (aka The Concrete Flamingo) (1958)\r\n    Man on the Run (aka Man in Motion) (1958)\r\n    The Sailcloth Shroud (1960)\r\n    Aground (1960)\r\n    The Long Saturday Night (aka Confidentially Yours; Finally, Sunday!)
