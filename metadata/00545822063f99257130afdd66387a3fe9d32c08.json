Thank you to swami who was transliterating audio to Hindi text. This was not easy task either.\r\n(ADHYAYA is probably some private marking of folders on someones HD. I got this thanks to one kind O-sannyasin in Madhavpur.\r\n\r\n   A:OSHO HINDITALKSOSHO_GEETA DARSHAN 218 1971 amr-Hindi audios\r\n\r\n      _ADHYAYA 01 &amp; 02 AHMEDABAD NOV 1970\r\n      _ADHYAYA 03\r\n      _ADHYAYA 04 MUMBAI JAN 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 05 MUMBAI MAR 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 06 AHMEDABAD MAY 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 07 AHMEDABAD MAY 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 08 AHMEDABAD SEPT 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 09 AHMEDABAD NOV 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 10 AHMEDABAD DEC 1971\r\n      _ADHYAYA 11 MUMBAI DEC 1972\r\n      _ADHYAYA 12 1972\r\n      _ADHYAYA 13 1972\r\n      _ADHYAYA 14 1972\r\n      _ADHYAYA 15 PUNE MAR 1974\r\n      _ADHYAYA 16 PUNE APR 1974\r\n      _ADHYAYA 17 PUNE MAY 1975\r\n      _ADHYAYA 18 PUNE AUG 1975","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00545822063f99257130afdd66387a3fe9d32c08","amp;dn":"OSHO_GEETA+DARSHAN+218+1971+amr-Hindi+audios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00545822063f99257130afdd66387a3fe9d32c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,84,88,34,6,63,153,37,113,48,175,221,102,56,122,63,233,211,44,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
