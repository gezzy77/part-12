Trott, T C Welch\nProduct Description\nThe use of refrigeration, either directly or as part of an air-conditioning system, is essential to almost every branch of industry.\nThere is a need for practitioners to familiarise themselves with the general principles and methods of refrigeration and air conditioning, and the types of plant and operation currently in use.\nThis book provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practice of refrigeration and air-conditioning for the uninitiated student and a general overview of the industry for the practitioner. The fundamentals of the subject are introduced without involving the reader too deeply in theory and the content is presented in a logical order.\n\nThis fully revised and updated third edition has a new chapter on Refrigerants that deals with the many changes in this area over the last 10 years, including the phase out of CFC and HCFC refrigerants in line with Ozone depletion and Global Warming. New, replacement refrigerants are described, together with Codes of Practice introduced for maintenance and servicing of refrigeration plants. The increased use of Ammonia and Propane are included, with the relevant Health and Safety aspects, and the move towards Absorption refrigeration equipment as more environmentally friendly.\n\nThis new edition of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning is a valuable reference source for practising engineers and essential reading for students.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 377 pages\nPublisher: Butterworth-Heinemann; 3 edition (March 16, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780750642194\nISBN-13: 978-0750642194\nASIN: 075064219X\n\n[poly-technic.blogsopt]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e056772fff51ce6f3547b2479553a756bb203d","amp;dn":"Refrigeration+and+Air-Conditioning+3rd+Edition+by+Trott%2C+Welch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e056772fff51ce6f3547b2479553a756bb203d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,224,86,119,47,255,81,206,111,53,71,178,71,149,83,167,86,187,32,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
