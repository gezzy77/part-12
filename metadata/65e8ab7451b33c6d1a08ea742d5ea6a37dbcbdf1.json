Natural history palaeontologist Richard Fortey investigates why certain life forms endure..\n\nPart 3: Frozen in Time\nIn episode three, Fortey looks at the Ice Age. 2.8 million years ago - triggered by slight changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun and shifts in its ocean currents - the world began to cool. Within a few thousand years much of the planet was shrouded in a dense cloak of ice that would come and go until only 10,000 years ago. We call this age of ice - the Pleistocene Age - and it transformed the hierarchy of nature. This is the story of how a few specialist species that evolved to live in the biting cold survived into the present day.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1527 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 700 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65e8ab7451b33c6d1a08ea742d5ea6a37dbcbdf1","amp;dn":"BBC.Survivors.Natures.Indestructible.Creatures.3of3.Frozen.in.Ti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65e8ab7451b33c6d1a08ea742d5ea6a37dbcbdf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,232,171,116,81,179,60,109,26,8,234,116,45,94,166,163,125,188,189,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
