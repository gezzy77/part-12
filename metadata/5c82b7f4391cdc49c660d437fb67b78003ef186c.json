It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. \nOk pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. \nSurely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nA torrent I found on Demonoid and I hardly made it to complete:\nA tribute to Jethro Tull by an unknown captive fan who made an excellent bootleg from footage material.\nMind - You have a double DVD... but don't expect a DVD quality (even if the result is at 90% highly satisfying...)\nTo those who want HD... forget it... this is 70s music... when video clips culture does not exist... take this as a fair example of progressive music...\n\n_______________________________\n\nNTSC DVD:\n\nThe original poster description of the torrent follows:\n\nDisc 1\n\n1 - Live in Tampa Stadium, Tampa, Florida USA - July 31, 1976.\n\n\t1- Thick as a Brick (excerpt) - \n\t2- Wond'ring Aloud\n\t3- Crazed Institution\n\t4- Instrumental/drum solo\n\t5- To Cry You A Song\n\t6- A New Day Yesterday\n\t7- Flute solo\n\t8- Living in the Past/Brick instrumental/A New Day Yesterday reprise\n\t9- Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll Too Young to Die\n\t10- Mintrel in the Gallery\n\t11- Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (excerpt)\n\n2 - Beat Club, German TV, 1970\n\n\t- With You There to Help Me/By Kind Permission of - jam\n\t- Nothing is Easy\n           Bonus footage:\n\t- Live at the Fillmore East, For at Thousand Mothers, 1970\n\n3 -  Swedish TV, 1969 Jan 9, 1969\n\n\t- To Be Sad is a Mad Way to Be\n\t- Back To The Family\n            Bonus footage:\n\t- Bouree, promotional video 1969\n\t- A Song For Jeffrey, Johnny Halliday Show, April 15, 1969\n\nDisc 2\n\n1 - Live at Golders Green London Hippodrome in London, February 10, 1977\n\n\t1- Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\n\t2- Jack In The Green\n\t3- Thick As A Brick (excerpt)\n\t4- Songs From The Wood\n\t5- Velvet Green\n\t6- Hunting Girl\n\t7- Aqualung\n\t8- Wind Up\n\t9- Locomotive Breath\n\t10- Ending credits\n\n2 - Live at the Tanglewood Music Fair, July 2, 1970\n\n* Very good quality pro-shot video but it's the audio that sometimes has issues and drop outs, mainly during the early part of My God. Those technical issues are part of the original feed and cannot be fixed by me.  However it does improve as the concert goes on.\n\n\t1- Nothing Is Easy\n\t2- My God\n\t3- With You There To Help Me - Ian announces the new guy, John Evan\n\t4- Dharma For One\n\t5- We Used To Know - \n\t6- Guitar solo\n           Bonus footage:\n\t- Witch's Promise, BBC 1970\n\n3 - The Minstrel Years 1971-1975 aka The Jeffrey Hammond - Hammond Era\n\nWould you believe Jethro Tull NEVER professionally recorded a show from this period? This is their prime! This is the era of Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, A Passion Play, Warchild and NO professional video OR EVEN soundboard audio of these tours exists to this day\n\nThey did film about an hour's worth of footage in Paris in July of 1975 but except for the clip of Minstrel in the Gallery you'll see on this DVD, the rest of this footage has yet to surface.\n\nThis portion of the DVD set does include more 8mm footage (of the Brick and Passion Play tours) than I would've liked to have included but I felt  I HAD to address this time in the band's history one way or another. I'm hoping that Tull fans will view those performances for what they are, as historical documents of a time of the band's history that otherwise would've been visually lost forever and only remembered by the souls who were there.  We are very fortunate that some fans snuck in their 8mm home cameras. \n\n\t- Life's A Long Song, promotional video from 1971\n\t- Thick As A Brick 8mm highlights, 1972-  from Rochester, New York USA.  Only about 4 minutes worth but very intereting to \t   see the band enter the stage in rabbitt costumes and Ian answering the phone in the middle of a performance.  Is there a \t\t   Mike Nelson in the audience? There seems to be a fish on the line.\n\t- A Passion Play 8mm highlights, 1973 - About 7 minutes of footage here.  The original live audio was so bad for this that \t\t   the audio from the remastered CD was edited i and synced up to the footage.  Much better viewing.\n\t- The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles, 1973 - the original film that was shown at the concerts the Passion Play tour.  \t\t\t   Excellent quality!\n\t- The Minstrel in the Gallery, Paris 1975 - about an hour and 10 minutes of footage was shot during November 1975.  This \t\t   is all that has surfaced.\n\n4 - A Little More Music...\n\nFive promotional videos to Wind things Up.\n\n\t- Teacher\n\t- Witch's Promise\n         Both of the above are promotional videos made for French Television in 1970\n\t- Too Old To Rock n Roll, To Young To Die, 1980\n\t- The Whistler - 1977\n\t- Living in the Past, footage from 1976 mixed in with current footage\n\nTotal Time Disc 1, 1:32\n\nTotal Time Disc 2, 2:22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c82b7f4391cdc49c660d437fb67b78003ef186c","amp;dn":"progressive+-+Jethro+Tull+-+The+Minstrel+Looks+Back+1969+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c82b7f4391cdc49c660d437fb67b78003ef186c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,130,183,244,57,28,220,73,198,96,212,55,251,103,183,128,3,239,24,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
