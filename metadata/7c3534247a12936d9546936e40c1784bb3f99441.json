In June of 1971, small\nportions of the report were leaked to the press and widely distributed.\nHowever, the publications of the report that resulted from these leaks\n were incomplete and suffered from many quality issues.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the leak to the press, the National Archives,\nalong with the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Presidential Libraries, has\nreleased the complete report. There are 48 boxes and approximately 7,000\ndeclassified pages. Approximately 34% of the report is available for the\nfirst time.\n\nWhat is unique about this, compared to other versions, is that:\n\n * The complete Report is now available with no redactions compared to\n   previous releases\n   \n * The Report is presented as Leslie Gelb presented it to then Secretary\n   of Defense Clark Clifford on January 15, 1969\n\n * All the supplemental back-documentation is included. In the Gravel\n   Edition, 80% of the documents in Part V.B. were not included\n\n * This release includes the complete account of peace negotiations,\n   significant portions of which were not previously available either\n   in the House Armed Services Committee redacted copy of the Report\n   or in the Gravel Edition\n\nRelated Resources:\n\n    National Declassification Center Blog\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://blogs.archives.gov/ndc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://blogs.archives.gov/ndc/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    Vietnam War research at NARA\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    John F.
