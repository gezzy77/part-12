Head First Ajax gives you an up-to-date perspective that lets you see exactly what you can do -- and has been done -- with Ajax. With it, you get a highly practical, in-depth, and mature view of what is now a mature development approach.\n\nUsing the unique and highly effective visual format that has turned Head First titles into runaway bestsellers, this book offers a big picture overview to introduce Ajax, and then explores the use of individual Ajax components -- including the JavaScript event model, DOM, XML, JSON, and more -- as it progresses. You'll find plenty of sample applications that illustrate the concepts, along with exercises, quizzes, and other interactive features to help you retain what you've learned.\n\nHead First Ajax covers:\n\n* The JavaScript event model\n* Making Ajax requests with XMLHTTPREQUEST objects\n* The asynchronous application model\n* The Document Object Model (DOM)\n* Manipulating the DOM in JavaScript\n* Controlling the browser with the Browser Object Model\n* XHTML Forms\n* POST Requests\n* XML Syntax and the XML DOM tree\n* XML Requests &amp; Responses\n* JSON -- an alternative to XML\n* Ajax architecture &amp; patterns\n* The Prototype Library\n\nThe book also discusses the server-side implications of building Ajax applications, and uses a &quot;black box&quot; approach to server-side components.\n\nHead First Ajax is the ideal guide for experienced web developers comfortable with scripting -- particularly those who have completed the exercises in Head First JavaScript -- and for experienced programmers in Java, PHP, and C# who want to learn client-side programming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d23c26ba9e74cf085a53d4a383351fa1ae6803","amp;dn":"head+first+ajax+-+ora+2008.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d23c26ba9e74cf085a53d4a383351fa1ae6803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,210,60,38,186,158,116,207,8,90,83,212,163,131,53,31,161,174,104,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
