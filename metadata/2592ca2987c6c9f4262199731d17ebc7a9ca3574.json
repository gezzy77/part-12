I didn?t find any torrents featuring this Irish guitar legend so I thought I?d off up this one.  Wheels Within Wheels was issued in 2003.  For those who are familiar with Gallagher?s music, this recording is a slight departure from his past releases.\nI?ll seed for awhile and see if it flies.  MP3 320 kbps\n\nMore about ?Wheels Within Wheels?\n\nAlthough best known for his barnstorming blues-rock Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher had a softer side, too. All of his studio albums contain at least one acoustic folk-blues track, and Gallagher included an unplugged set in the majority of his live shows way before that was fashionable. Almost eight years after his death, Rory s brother Donal compiled a 14-track collection of previously unreleased work dedicated to Gallagher s folkier approach. It&amp;#039;s the second such posthumous album (the terrific live and very electric BBC Sessions came out in 1999), and focuses on an important if lesser recognized aspect of the guitarist&amp;#039;s career. It&amp;#039;s also an eclectic set that shifts from melodic ballads (&quot;Wheels Within Wheels&quot; to instrumental modified flamenco (&quot;Flight to Paradise&quot; with classical guitarist Juan Martin and solo Delta blues (a studio take of Tony Joe White s &quot;As the Crow Flies,&quot; the live version of which was a highlight of Irish Tour . And that&amp;#039;s just the first three songs. Unreleased gems such as &quot;Lonesome Highway&quot; sound like classic Gallagher (this even features a plugged-in solo), but the disc is most successful when it unearths rare collaborations with Martin Carthy Bert Jansch and Scottish skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan The latter is caught live on a rousing version of &quot;Goin&amp;#039; to My Hometown,&quot; one of this album&amp;#039;s many highlights. The heavily bootlegged &quot;The Cuckoo,&quot; also finds official release in a stirring version assisted by Roland Van Campenhout on second guitar. Three live tunes with stripped-down accompaniment from BÃƒÂ©la Fleck on banjo and harmonica master Mark Feltham find Gallagher running through a seemingly improvised medley of &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; Robert  Johnson s &quot;Walking Blues,&quot; and Bill Monroe s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky,&quot; showing just how diverse Gallagher s tastes were. Established Gallagher fans will love this for the unusually laid-back setting, but Wheels Within Wheels might also attract a hardcore folk audience likely unaware of the rock guitarist&amp;#039;s affinity for this genre. The varying sound quality is a little sketchy, especially on the concert tracks, but the sheer enthusiasm and joy infused in these grooves override any audio shortcomings. ~ Hal Horowitz, All Music Guide\n\n1 Wheels Within Wheels  3:32 \n2 Flight To Paradise 4:30 \n3 As The Crow Flies  4:12 \n4 Lonesome Highway 5:22\n5 Bratcha Dubha  2:59 \n6  She Moved Thro&amp;#039; The Fair 2:22 \n7 Barley &amp; Grape Rag 7:25\n8 The Cuckoo  3:45\n9 Amazing Grace 1:20\n10 Walkin&amp;#039; Blues  5:34 \n11 Blue Moon of Kentucky 2:54 \n12 Deep Elm Blues 4:17 \n13 Goin&amp;#039; To My Hometown  4:58\n14 Lonesome Highway Refraining 2:00\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2592ca2987c6c9f4262199731d17ebc7a9ca3574","amp;dn":"Rory+Gallagher+Wheels+Within+Wheels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2592ca2987c6c9f4262199731d17ebc7a9ca3574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,146,202,41,135,198,201,244,38,33,153,115,29,23,235,199,169,202,53,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
