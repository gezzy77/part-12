The album was eventually shelved, as Rory explained to a journalist in the early 90's, because 'maybe eighty percent of the San Francisco album could come out in some form - remixed. The problem was: the mixing was getting complicated and some of the songs (just didn`t sound right).'\n\nFor the first time, the recordings from this session will see the light of day on the 2-CD package 'Notes From San Francisco'. The first disc features the results of this recording session. The version of 'Overnight Bag' that appears on here first appeared on the Rory Gallagher 'Crest of a Wave' 2-CD compilation (ER201622). The lineup for the studio sessions consists of Rory Gallagher (Guitars / Vocals), Gerry McAvoy (bass), Lou Martin (piano / keyboards), Rod de'Ath (drums), Joe O'Donnell (violin on 'Mississippi Sheiks') and Martin Fiero (Saxophone on 'Rue The Day' and 'Brute Force &amp; Ignorance').\n\nDisc 2 consists of a massively energetic live concert recorded in December of 1979 at The Old Waldorf in San Francisco. The lineup for this show features Rory on guitar &amp; vocals, Gerry McAvoy on bass and Ted McKenna on drums.
