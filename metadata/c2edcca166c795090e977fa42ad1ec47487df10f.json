On his second album, though, the Canada native throws some curve balls into the mix. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Robots need love, too/They want to be loved by you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sings on the second track, which begins as an acoustic tune before expanding into a stomping, horn-filled singalong. Auxiliary instruments surface throughout Nice, Nice, Very Nice, throwing some refreshing quirkiness into an album that sometimes leans too heavily on sad, stripped-down folk. When Mangan scales back the arrangements, as he does on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The India Queens Are Waiting,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the results are tuneful but somewhat anonymous, as if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content to blaze the same trail as fellow folkster Bon Iver. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s during the unexpected moments -- the quick crescendos in Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Silly Git,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the electric guitar riffs in Ã¢â‚¬Å“TinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Glorious Comeback,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the dynamic opening track -- that he carves out a unique identity, and there are enough moments here to make this a pleasant follow-up.\n\nweb download\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/15/dan-mangan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/15/dan-mangan/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2edcca166c795090e977fa42ad1ec47487df10f","amp;dn":"Dan+Mangan...Nice%2C+Nice%2C+Very+Nice%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2edcca166c795090e977fa42ad1ec47487df10f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,237,204,161,102,199,149,9,14,151,127,164,42,209,236,71,72,125,241,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
