No information on the songs was provided at all, no artist names, no song titles, and no recording dates. Four years later, Parallel World reissued this compilation on CD with a few extra tracks, but still without any identifying information. Unfortunately, it is more than likely that many of the featured musicians, showing a definite Western influence in their music, were murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime which took over power in 1975. Certainly none of them ever received any money from the sales of this compilation. However, the music is wonderful, and here it is for your enjoyment.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfo and most songs taken from http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/12/cambodian-rocks.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2d6089c941fc2bf92cc650887aa96ff6bbe2eb","amp;dn":"Cambodian+Rocks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2d6089c941fc2bf92cc650887aa96ff6bbe2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,45,96,137,201,65,252,43,249,44,198,80,136,122,169,111,246,187,226,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
