This book covers all the major topics and tactics. Starting with a brief background history, rolling into RSF's structure and command and control. Cover some of the methods to secure and control rural villages from terrorist incursions and intimidation, much like the techniques used in Malaya and Vietnam (hearts and minds to some extent). Discuses some of the Rhodesians methods to control their borders, from insurgent crossing and the employment of mines, which today they are still dealing with residue effects of these minefield.\n\nThis book covers the intelligence apparatus in a counter-insurgency conflict in great detail, which worked successfully in Rhodesia. In particular their use of elite units (Selous Scouts and Rhodesian Special Air Service (SAS)) coupled with their intelligence network. The Rhodesians used and mastered a technique pioneered by the British in Kenya and Malaya known as Pseudo-terrorist operations. This technique accounted for more kills then any other method used and made the Selous Scouts world famous. The coverage in this book is unsurpassed and the most detailed I've read on it. For this alone the book is worth the price. The also has excellent chapter on external operations; taking the fight to the terrorist safe-haven and eliminating the threat at the source, much like what we need to do to the Taliban operating in Afghanistan and hiding in Pakistan. This is a most read book for all military leaders and Special Operations personnel. I can not recommend more!\n\n\nHardcover: 288 pages\nPublisher: Routledge Kegan &amp; Paul (December 1984)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0709934122\nISBN-13: 978-0709934127\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Counter-Insurgency-Rhodesia-J-K-Cilliers/dp/0709934122/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372462648&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Counter-Insurgency+in+Rhodesia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Counter-Insurgency-Rhodesia-J-K-Cilliers/dp/0709934122/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372462648&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Counter-Insurgency+in+Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaNALAAEi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/JaNALAAEi&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6df75068c418dbedaf12c7a8f5c4388483ee7f8","amp;dn":"Counter-Insurgency+in+Rhodesia+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6df75068c418dbedaf12c7a8f5c4388483ee7f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,223,117,6,140,65,141,190,218,241,44,122,143,92,67,136,72,62,231,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
