When it comes to documentation, however, much of them are shrouded in mystery. Cocoa and Carbon, the application frameworks, are neatly described, but system programmers find the rest lacking. This indispensable guide illuminates the darkest corners of those systems, starting with an architectural overview, then drilling all the way to the core.\n\n- Provides you with a top down view of OS X and iOS\n- Walks you through the phases of system startupÃ¢â‚¬â€both Mac (EFi) and mobile (iBoot)\n- Explains how processes, threads, virtual memory, and filesystems are maintained\n- Covers the security architecture\n- Reviews the internal Apis used by the systemÃ¢â‚¬â€BSD and Mach\n- Dissects the kernel, XNU, into its sub components: Mach, the BSD Layer, and I/o kit, and explains each in detail\n- Explains the inner workings of device drivers\n\nFrom architecture to implementation, this book is essential reading if you want to get serious about the internal workings of Mac OS X and iOS.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nPeeling AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Operating Systems\n\nSystem-level developers, kernel hackers, and intrigued Apple-lytes, take heed: This book lets you explore the nooks and crannies of Mac OS X and iOS, delving into the architecture of both systems, and picking up where the frameworks (and documentation) leave off. It offers clear, detailed explanation of the inner workings of AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s systems, including proprietary APIs, most of which are documented for the first time.\n\nAs you traverse the architecture, moving from user to kernel mode, each layer and component is unraveled with annotated code samples and hands-on experiments, comparing and contrasting its implementation in both OSes. Topics include:\n\n- The boot process: MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EFI, iOSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iBoot, and kernel startup\n- Processes, threads, and virtual memory management\n- Debugging and profiling, using DTrace, ptrace, and hidden system calls\n- The system level APIs: POSIX calls, Mach traps, and OS X/iOS proprietary\n- File system architecture, including VFS and HFS+\n- Network architecture: from sockets to interfaces, and network drivers\n- Kernel extensions, drivers, and a discussion of I/O Kit architecture\n- Security features, Mandatory Access Control, and iOS jail\n\nThe companion web site (http://www.newosxbook.com) includes sample programs, freely downloadable tools, updated references, and bonus additions.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: For Power Users\nChapter 1.
