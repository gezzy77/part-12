Lead vocalist and \n   lyricist Daniel Layus has dug deep and emerged with a passionate, rootsy \n   rock collection that is distinctively American, recalling the muscularity \n   and epic sweep of albums by Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen in their heyday. \n   The album is a shimmering blend of rock, folk, and country that manages to \n   sound both modern and timeless. The subtle, streamlined production by \n   Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Norah Jones) lets the true beauty of Layus \n   soulful vocal delivery, as well as the band's barnstorming performances,\n   shine through.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
