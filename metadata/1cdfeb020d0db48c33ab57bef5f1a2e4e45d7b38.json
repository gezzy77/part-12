Their unique sound was matched only by their distinctive appearance in those clips-long beards, wild suits, custom vintage red ford and the trademark arm swing.\n\nAt first glance, the three men who make up ZZ Top--the stoically silent, bearded look-a-likes Frank Beard and Dusty Hill and curly-haired front man Billy Gibbons--appear to be American rednecks with a little extra cash and access to musical instruments. However, the three men are actually acclaimed and hugely successful rock stars, whose Southern blues-influenced rock has proved appealing to millions of Americans. Along with being expert musicians, ZZ Top have also become cultural icons, their music videos representative of a certain slice of car and girl-loving Americana, as exemplified especially in &quot;Legs.&quot; This  compilation contains 12 of the band's videos. Included is the acclaimed Eliminator trilogy of &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin,&quot; &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; and &quot;Legs,&quot; along with &quot;TV Dinners,&quot; &quot;Stages,&quot; the group's rendition of the Elvis Presley classic &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; and so much more.\n\nPlaylist:\n1.Gimme All Your Lovin \n2.Sharp Dressed Man \n3.Legs' \n4.TV Dinners \n5.Sleeping Bag \n6.Stages' \n7Rough boy \n8.Velco Fly\n9.Give it up \n10.My Head's In Mississippi \n11.Burger Man \n12.Viva Las Vegas\n\nGeneral\nComplete name   : C:\\ZZ Top Greatest Hits The Video\nFormat          : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size       : 740 MiB\nDuration        : 50mn 39s\nOverall bit rate    : 2 042 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                     : 0\nFormat                 : MPEG-4 Visual\nBit rate               : 1 901 Kbps\nWidth c Height         : 720 x 648 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio   : 1.111\nFrame rate             : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nID           : 1\nFormat       : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer Mode         : Joint stereo\nBit rate     : 128 Kbps Constant\nChannel(s)   : 2 channels\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cdfeb020d0db48c33ab57bef5f1a2e4e45d7b38","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+Greatest+Hits+The+Video+Collection%28avi%29%28rock%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cdfeb020d0db48c33ab57bef5f1a2e4e45d7b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,223,235,2,13,13,180,140,51,171,87,190,245,241,162,228,228,93,123,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
