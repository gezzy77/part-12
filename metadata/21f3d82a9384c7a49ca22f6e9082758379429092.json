So choose the SECOND option.!!!\n*************************************************************************************************************************\n\nAll Credits &amp; Thanx fly out to:\ngeeses (and everybody who helped him out) - the goddamn GENIUS who made this modification! WORSHIP HIM!!!\nxoa - the incredibly nice guy who helped me obtain this. Thanx a bunch, buddy! ;)\n\n                         a n d   o f   c o u r s e\n\nThe Google(tm) Foundation - for creating the one search engine to rule them all!! xD\n\n\n\n\n^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^\n\nNOTICE: This is a patched version of torrent found in http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3880605 and should work for everyone (depending on PS2 or modchip version, some users might have experienced a crash near the end-game). That is fixed now and everything is fine. So those who want to get a perfect version of the game and don&amp;#039;t want to start pathing themselves.\n\nThis file has a different releaser, as I got permission from the original releaser to put this patched up after I&amp;#039;ve downloaded it. Took a while because this was in MegaUpload and I don&amp;#039;t have a premium-access there (anyone wanting to buy me a lifetime Premium? :D)\n\nAlso one thing. I un-rarred the file. so its only one .ISO file and not 39 .rar files with 95 MB filesize. Those of you who have their HDD&amp;#039;s full of porn already and can&amp;#039;t extract this without deleting some... fear not as its not needed anymore :)\n\nTruly yours,\nArinohyoshi\n\n^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f3d82a9384c7a49ca22f6e9082758379429092","amp;dn":"%5BPATCHED%5D+Final+Fantasy+X+-+International+-+JapaneseVoice+Englis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f3d82a9384c7a49ca22f6e9082758379429092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,243,216,42,147,132,199,164,156,162,47,110,144,130,117,131,121,66,144,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
