More specifically it's a file placement optimizer.... the world's only file placement optimizer. UltimateDefrag gives you 6 defrag methods with multiple options that give you hundreds of combinations for positioning files on your hard drive for optimum performance. No other defragger gives you this. There are numerous ways and criteria by which you can select files. \n\nThe archive feature places files you rarely use out of the way to the slower inner tracks of your hard drive so they don't compete with your frequently used files for the faster areas of your drive. This maximizes seek confinement resulting in much faster file access. You can place directories right next to the MFT resulting in fastest directory access possible while seeking files.\n\n\nFeatures In The New UltimateDefrag4\n\n* NEW!
