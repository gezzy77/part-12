Long before the word &quot;mash-up&quot; came into being, Parks pieced together a sound collage of musical Americana that careens from Stephen Foster to Tin Pan Alley to Laurel Canyon, with lyrics studded with puns and word play. Said to be the most expensive album recorded to that time, the record was a commercial flop but has many enthusiastic admirers. Like Orson Welles' &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; it's a one-of-a-kind creation. No one, not even Parks, ever tried to equal it.
