An invaluable resource for those with limited background in the field, it equips you with a solid foundation in the basics of film. Exploring cutting-edge technologies as well as traditional techniques, the text covers lighting, cameras, editing, crew organization, and the production process. It uses clear terminology to explain complex topics and also lays out the basic, conventional approach to scene structure in a straightforward and methodical manner. Extremely practical, the text not only illustrates what you need to know to make a film but also it gives a sense of the magnitude of the process--the trials and tribulations, the mistakes, and the myriad intangibles that can make up a production. Diagrams and screen grabs throughout vividly illustrate the inner workings of equipment and the step-by-step procedures to execute specific tasks.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nBruce Mamer's experience stretches across academia and the professional filmmaking market. Over the last 30 years, Mamer has freelanced with various lighting, shooting, and sound crews. In addition, he has directed many social service, documentary, and fictional film and video projects. Mamer taught film and video production for more than 25 years and is currently writing freelance on film and video topics, as well as rekindling an old love affair with still photography--working in both film and digital formats (http://jmlfoto.com). Up to date with the technology in his field, Mamer is very good at boiling down complex technical concepts and communicating them in a way that students can fully understand. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 480 pages\n    * Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 5 edition (January 3, 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0495411167\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0495411161","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5651972e6ed074bf42358f252546b13cfe143b","amp;dn":"Film+Production+Technique%2C5th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5651972e6ed074bf42358f252546b13cfe143b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,86,81,151,46,110,208,116,191,66,53,143,37,37,70,177,60,254,20,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
