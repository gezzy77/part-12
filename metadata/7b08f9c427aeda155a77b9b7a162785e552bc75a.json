This film exposes how every major war in US history was based on a complete fraud with video of insiders themselves admitting it. This film shows how the first film theaters in the US were used over a hundred years ago to broadcast propaganda to rile the American people into the Spanish-American War. This film shows the white papers of the oil company Unocal which called for the creation of a pipeline through Afghanistan and how their exact needs were fulfilled through the US invasion of Afghanistan. This film shows how Halliburton under their &quot;cost plus&quot; exclusive contract with the US Government went on a mad dash spending spree akin to something out of the movie Brewster's Millions, yet instead of blowing $30 million they blew through BILLIONS by literally burning millions of dollars worth of hundred thousand dollar cars and trucks if they had so much as a flat tire. &quot;A stunning film. It should be seen as widely as possible, in cinemas, bars, clubs, at meetings and, of course, through the internet. I'm sure the film will continue to be a source of debate and political education for many years. Maybe until the war criminals have been brought to trial.&quot; - Ken Loach While Massimo MazzuccoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first political documentary, GLOBAL DECEIT (2006), focused on the long list of inconsistencies in the official version of the 9/11 attacks, THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY explores the historical, philosophical and economic background that suggests a matrix for such events that is much closer to home than the so-called &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;. The film provides solid evidence for the true reasons behind the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, whose unfolding is described in chilling detail in a document called &quot;Project for the New American Century&quot;, published in the year 2000, that seems to have served as the actual blueprint for such dramatic events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b08f9c427aeda155a77b9b7a162785e552bc75a","amp;dn":"The+New+American+Century.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b08f9c427aeda155a77b9b7a162785e552bc75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,8,249,196,39,174,218,21,90,119,185,183,161,98,120,94,85,43,199,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
