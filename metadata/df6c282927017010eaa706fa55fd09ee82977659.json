Their primary similarity to other southern rock bands is the dual lead guitar interplay, a defining characteristic of many southern rock bands.\n\n However, the OutlawsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mix of country and rock elements displays the vocal harmony influences of groups like Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Poco. Their use of three and four part harmonies set them apart from their contemporaries who usually relied on a single lead vocalist.\n\nTracks\n\n1.
