While caring for his ailing sister, Denny must discover a way to recharge his device before he's left with no defense against a past that wants him dead.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Denny notices a mysterious stranger following him - keeping tabs on Denny, his family, and his friends. Is Denny just paranoid? Or maybe he isn't alone in this new reality after all...\r\n\r\nWhen his chaser is stolen and his girlfriend is kidnapped, Denny risks everything to get both of them back. Launched into a high-stakes chase that spans continents and millennia, Denny's responsibility to save our future isn't over yet. It will take all of his cunning to stop a threat capable of steering the fate of the human race into disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Vikas Adam\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2015bcbcbd3d224b15d34c3965549251db481280","amp;dn":"Brett+Battles+-+Destroyer+%28Rewinder+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2015bcbcbd3d224b15d34c3965549251db481280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,21,188,188,189,61,34,75,21,211,76,57,101,84,146,81,219,72,18,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
