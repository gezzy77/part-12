This is debatably maybe \r\nthe best sounding audience recording circulating for any \r\nzeppelin show. If not the best then at least one of the top \r\n2 or 3 best.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. The Song Remains The Same\r\n02. Celebration Day\r\n03. Black Dog\r\n04. Nobody's Fault But Mine\r\n05. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n06. Misty Mountain Hop\r\n07. Since I've Been Loving You\r\n08. No Quarter\r\n09. Ten Years Gone\r\n10. Hot Dog\r\n11. The Rain Song\r\n12. White Summer\r\n13. Kashmir\r\n14. Trampled Underfoot\r\n15. Sick Again\r\n16. Achilles Last Stand\r\n17. Guitar Solo\r\n18. In The Evening\r\n19. Stairway To Heaven\r\n20. Whole Lotta Love\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nIn some spots, this show is better than the previous week's, \r\nespecially in the beginning, which has much energy. But as it \r\nprogresses it gets sloppy and tentative. Ten Years Gone starts \r\nbeautifully but progresses to sound hesitant and downright \r\nmessy. In fact there were some problems with Jones' effect \r\npedals prior to that song. Achilles Last Stand is strong and \r\npowerful, as is In The Evening, but Stairway To Heaven sounds \r\nrushed, tired, and unenthusiastic. The encore of Whole Lotta \r\nLove features a refreshing new arrangement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066c8767a4de10d7900478d9b41555ffb7f91db8","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1979.07.24+Copenhagen%2C+Denmark+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066c8767a4de10d7900478d9b41555ffb7f91db8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,108,135,103,164,222,16,215,144,4,120,217,180,21,85,255,183,249,29,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
