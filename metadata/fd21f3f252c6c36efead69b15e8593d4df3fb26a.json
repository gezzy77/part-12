A killer virus had killed the occupants of a small village in Thailand. A former colleague named &quot;F&quot; discovers the secrets of the virus and sends a young boy somehow immune to the fatal disease to L's doorstep. A few days later, 12-year old Maki ( Mayuko Fukuda) also shows up with a different strain of the virus, described as a combination of Ebola and Influenza. Apparently, her father Nikaido (Shingo Tsurumi) had created the virus and a subversive group called &quot;Blue Ship&quot; is after it. Leader Dr. Kujo (Youki Kudoh) intends to use it to change the world by ridding it of all the useless people who inhabit it--useless people are those who abuse our natural resources; so you can guess exactly just how many people they intend to eliminate.\n\nRun Time: 129 minutes\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English Hard Coded\n\ncredit jdpennington BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd21f3f252c6c36efead69b15e8593d4df3fb26a","amp;dn":"Death+Note+L+Change+the+World+DvDRip+XviD-JDP%28HARDCODE+ENG+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd21f3f252c6c36efead69b15e8593d4df3fb26a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,33,243,242,82,198,195,110,254,173,105,177,94,133,147,212,223,63,178,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
