This comprehensive handbook makes readers familiar with a broad spectrum of approaches to solve various problems in science and technology. Possible approaches include, for example, those being inspired by biology, living organisms and animate systems. Content is organized in seven parts: foundations; fuzzy logic; rough sets; evolutionary computation; neural networks; swarm intelligence and hybrid computational intelligence systems. Each Part is supervised by its own Part Editor(s) so that high-quality content as well as completeness are assured","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17efed606b0e92fb0ac67afbe5204e22c4f2d1fc","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Computational+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17efed606b0e92fb0ac67afbe5204e22c4f2d1fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,239,237,96,107,14,146,251,10,198,122,251,229,32,78,34,196,242,209,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
