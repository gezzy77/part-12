Mi-Sex - Computer Games [1980]\n\nEven in the often strange and incestuous history of New Zealand rock, few bands enjoyed a more bizarre career than Misex; led by onetime cabaret singer Steve Gilpin, the group emerged from art-rock beginnings to later reinvent themselves in the style of the new wave. The band moved to Australia in the late 70s, a move proved highly successful, and in 1979 they issued their debut LP, Computer Games. The single, &quot;Computer Games,&quot; topped the Australian charts, and the group made a triumphant return to New Zealand. A second album, 1980's Space Race, was also a hit, but when a planned American tour fell through, Misex's momentum took a serious blow; even at home, audiences were dwindling, and 1981's Shanghaied made little impact. Hodgkinson soon exited, to be replaced by ex-Coup D'Etat drummer Paul Dunningham; a few minor hits followed, including &quot;Castaway&quot; and &quot;Blue Day,&quot; but after 1984's Where Do They Go? failed to crack the charts, Misex disbanded. Steve Gilpin died in 1991. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Computer Games.mp3 6 MiB \n02 Graffiti Crimes.mp3 6 MiB \n03 Wot Do You Want.mp3 4 MiB \n04 Not Such A Bad Boy.mp3 4 MiB \n05 Stills.mp3 8 MiB \n06 But You Don't Care.mp3 6 MiB \n07 A Loser.mp3 4 MiB \n08 21-20.mp3 5 MiB \n09 Camera Kazi.mp3 8 MiB \n10 Inside You.mp3 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c542bed101496a83e03b8db3f551d8a71978e3","amp;dn":"Rare+80s+-+Feat.+Mi-Sex+-+Computer+Games+%5B1980%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c542bed101496a83e03b8db3f551d8a71978e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,197,66,190,209,1,73,106,131,224,59,141,179,245,81,216,167,25,120,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
