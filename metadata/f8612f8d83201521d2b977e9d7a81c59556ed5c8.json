This king of electric pianos played through a vintage tube combo and captured by rare vintage microphones is a truly unique instrument.

The included ExploreMaps let you choose from classic Rhodes sounds to spacious textures and fat bass sounds. The Mark One is a rare and one of a kind instrument that fits perfectly both on stage and in the studio.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nXLN Audio Addictive Keys\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
