He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriter partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.\n\nIn his four-decade career John has sold more than 250 million records, making him one of the most successful artists of all time. His single &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; has sold over 33 million copies worldwide, and is the best selling single in the history of the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100. He has more than 50 Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 56 Top 40 singles, 16 Top 10, four No. 2 hits, and nine No. 1 hits. He has won six Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Tony Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him Number 49 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\nJohn was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Having been named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996, John received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for &quot;services to music and charitable services&quot; in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.\n\nHe has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over $200 million.\n\nJohn entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005 and continues to be a champion for LGBT social movements. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked him as the most successful male solo artist on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot; (third overall, behind only The Beatles and Madonna).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a990d549da69d4cd911821ac1f91dbcf29051c","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Greatest+Hits+Volume+II+%5B1992%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a990d549da69d4cd911821ac1f91dbcf29051c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,169,144,213,73,218,105,212,205,145,24,33,172,31,145,219,207,41,5,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
