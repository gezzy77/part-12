In the 1960s, as members of \n\nthe house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla and Rufus Thomas and \n\nJohnnie Taylor. They also released instrumental records under their own name, such as the 1962 hit single &quot;Green Onions&quot;. As originators of the unique Stax sound, \n\nthe group was one of the most prolific, respected, and imitated of their era. By the mid-1960s, bands on both sides of the Atlantic were trying to sound like Booker \n\nT. &amp; the M.G.'s.\n\nOriginal members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson, Jr. (drums). In 1965 \n\nSteinberg was replaced by Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, who has played with the group ever since. Al Jackson, Jr. was murdered in 1975, since then the trio of Dunn, \n\nCropper and Jones have reunited on numerous occasions using various drummers, including Willie Hall, Anton Fig, Steve Jordan and Steve Potts.\n\nHaving two white members (Cropper and Dunn), Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s were unusual in being racially integrated, at a time when Soul music, and the Memphis \n\nmusic scene in particular, were generally considered the preserve of black culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b850d503e761df5dbef5f3c6c7f0f4e61d1397ac","amp;dn":"Booker.T+%26+The+MG%5C%27+Booker+T+%26+the+MG%5C%27s+-+Green+Onions+%28Shindig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b850d503e761df5dbef5f3c6c7f0f4e61d1397ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,80,213,3,231,97,223,93,190,245,243,198,199,240,244,230,29,19,151,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
