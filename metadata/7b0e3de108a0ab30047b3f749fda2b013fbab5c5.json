Armin-Mueller Stahl plays a Polish farmer living under the wartime Nazi occupation. Stahl isn't too offended at the prospect of answering to the Germans; in fact, he has profited by confiscating the property of his neighbor, a wealthy Jew. His conscience doesn't disturb him until a starving Jewish woman (Elisabeth Trissenaar) stumbles onto his property. At first Stahl shelters her, but his baser instincts surface; she is in no position to refuse when he ultimately rapes her. She even comes to fall in love with Stahl--and kills herself when another woman moves in with him. Stahl survives the war with health and wealth intact, only mildly disturbed by the misery he has caused. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Bittere Ernte.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.47 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 40mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 086 Kbps\n      Movie name : Bittere Ernte (1985) \n      Director : Agnieszka Holland\n      Genre : Drama\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n      Original source form/Name : Movie\n      Copyright : rip by cine-clasico russound by ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âª-92 sound sync by boeing747m \n      Comment :\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 1 885 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 496 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.226\n      Stream size : 1.33 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0SMP (UTC 2006-01-08)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 139 MiB (9%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0088811\n\nGerman audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by janatas, suntitles added by scalisto\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b0e3de108a0ab30047b3f749fda2b013fbab5c5","amp;dn":"Agnieszka+Holland+-+Bittere+Ernte+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b0e3de108a0ab30047b3f749fda2b013fbab5c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,14,61,225,8,160,171,48,4,123,63,116,159,218,43,1,63,186,181,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
