The core unit here ÃƒÂ¹ Spalding, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, keyboardist Leo Genovese, and percussionist Quintino Cinalli ÃƒÂ¹ is joined by a string trio on a number of tracks. (Gil Goldstein collaborated with Spalding on the string arrangements and production.) The opener ÃƒÂ´Little FlyÃƒÂ¶ effectively sets the words of a Walt Whitman poem to music for voice, bass, and string trio. ÃƒÂ´Chacarera,ÃƒÂ¶ based on the Argentinean rhythm, is full of clattering percussion, zigzagging vocal lines, and fine work from cellist Dave Eggar. Eggar also solos on an intriguing cover of ÃƒÂ´Wild Is the Wind,ÃƒÂ¶ which has nice melodica from Genovese. Special treat: the great Milton Nascimento joins Spalding for a vocal duet on ÃƒÂ´Apple Blossom.ÃƒÂ¶\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Little Fly  (03:33), 8.26 MB\n02.
