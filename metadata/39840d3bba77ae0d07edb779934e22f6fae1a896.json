Yet despite initial optimism in his battle against leukemia, his health took a turn for the worst and he passed away suddenly at the end of August 2003 at the age of 40. He will be greatly missed by his friends and hordes of music &amp; art fans the world over. This enhanced CD is yet another celebration of Wesley&amp;#039;s life.\n\nCompiled by noted Wesley scholar Jello Biafra, &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume 3&quot; again culls the chestnuts from dozens of self-produced Wesley CDs, to unreleased and very early classics hardly anyone knew existed. Like Screamin&amp;#039; Jay Hawkins, Wesley Willis has created a persona so unique, no one dares try to imitate it. And boy has he put a spell on us.\n\nSure, many of his songs sound similar. But Jello created a great selection here displaying as many different sounding sopngs as possible; from the hard-rockin&amp;#039; Wesley Willis Fiasco tracks (Do It), to his playful use of vocal effects (Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers) and even the lo-fi new wave sound. (Gingerbread Knoched Me Out)\n\nThis CD has 25 songs and the enhanced part contains great video montage of Wesley as well as artwork, photos, sound samples, and liner notes by Jello Biafra and Henry Rollins. So tune in for a true harmony joyride from Rock &amp; Roll&amp;#039;s most beautiful mind &amp; spirit - Wesley Willis.\n\nRock Over London...Rock on Chicago...Long Live Wesley Willis\n\n1.\t&quot;Verbal Assault&quot;\n2.\t&quot;The Viper Room&quot;\n3.\t&quot;I&amp;#039;m Going on a World Tour&quot;\n4.\t&quot;If&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Your Way Right Away&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Make My Joyplane Crash and Burn&quot;\n7.\t&quot;I Whipped Spiderman&amp;#039;s Ass&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Suck A Pitbull&amp;#039;s Dick&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Oprah Winfrey&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Love God&quot;\n11.\t&quot;I&amp;#039;m the Daddy of Rock and Roll&quot;\n12.\t&quot;My Keyboard Got Damaged&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Wrigley Field&quot;\n14.\t&quot;Chuckie&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&quot;\n16.\t&quot;My Mother Smokes Crack Rocks&quot; \n17.\t&quot;Beware of Dog&quot;\n18.\t&quot;Gingerbread Knocked Me Out&quot;\n19.\t&quot;Do It&quot;\n20.\t&quot;Suck a Polar Bear&amp;#039;s Dick&quot;\n21.\t&quot;The Horse Bit Me&quot;\n22.\t&quot;Carla Winterbottom&quot;\n23.\t&quot;Catalina&quot;\n24.\t&quot;Benny the Bull&quot;\n25.\t&quot;It&amp;#039;s the End of the Western&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39840d3bba77ae0d07edb779934e22f6fae1a896","amp;dn":"Wesley+Willis+-+Greatest+Hits+Volume+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39840d3bba77ae0d07edb779934e22f6fae1a896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,132,13,59,186,119,174,13,7,237,183,121,147,78,34,246,250,225,168,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
