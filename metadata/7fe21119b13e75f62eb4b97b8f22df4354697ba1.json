At the heart of the valley lies a remarkable farmhouse, a building that is being run just as it was in the year 1620. Without electricity, refrigeration, mains water, tractors or chemical pesticides, our group will live off the land, eating the period food they grow and wearing the period clothing they can create. We watch and share the drama and frustration as they cope with a plethora of natural challenges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with 400 year-old manuals as their source of knowledge. Each programme focuses on the a month in the life of the farm, following the seasonal tasks our team endeavour to carry out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from harvesting and building, to the birthing of calves and pigs, from salting and smoking meat to sheep shearing and garment making. The series is genuinely revealing about life in times gone byÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nPart 10: June\nIt is June, and the team need to give the sheep a good wash in a local stream, warmed by a period potion called sheepwashers' posset. Only then can they start shearing them by hand, a backbreaking task. In the dairy, the girls have a go at making cheese the old fashioned way, and the boys have to catch up with weeding the wheat field\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1541 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x464 (16.9)\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 30mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 350 MB\nSource: DVD\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe21119b13e75f62eb4b97b8f22df4354697ba1","amp;dn":"BBC.Tales.From.The.Green.Valley.10of12.June.x264.AC3..mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe21119b13e75f62eb4b97b8f22df4354697ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,226,17,25,177,62,117,246,46,180,185,123,143,34,223,67,84,105,123,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
