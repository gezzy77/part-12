Audiences embraced the mouse like no cartoon character before him. Overnight Mickey Mouse Clubs sprung up all over the world. But the success of Mickey came at a price. Because audiences cherished Mickey so much, the Disney animators were forced to tone down his wild behavior. Mickey became less &quot;funny&quot; and needed a band of crazy brothers to pick up the slack. One such sidekick was Goofy, perhaps the wildest and wackiest character in the entire Disney pantheon. Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy a limited edition DVD set hosted by film historian Leonard Maltin, turns the spotlight on Mickey's favorite chum, thanks to Disney Home Entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\ndisc 1-1939-1948\n\n1.1939[Goofy And Wilbur\n\n2.1940[Goofy`s Glider]\n\n3.1941[Baggage Buster]\n4.1941[The Art Of Skiing]\n5.1941[The Art Of Self Defense]\n\n6.1942[How To Play Baseball]\n7.1942[The Olympic Champ]\n8.1942[How To Swim]\n9.1942[How To Fish]\n\n10.1943[Victory Vehicles\n\n11.1944[How To Be A Sailor]\n12.1944[How To Play Golf]\n13.1944.How To Play Football]\n\n14.1945[Tiger Trouble]\n15.1945[African Diary]\n16.1945[Californy `Er Bust]\n17.1945[Hockey Homicide]\n\n18.1946[Knight For A day]\n19.1946[Double Dribble]\n\n20.1947[Foul Hunting]\n\n21.1948[They`re Off]\n22.1948[The Big Wash]\n\nbonus material\n\nEssential goof\nthe man behind the goof\n-------------------------------\n\n\nDisc Two 1949-1961\n\n1.1949[Tennis Racquet]\n2.1949[Goofy Gymnastics]\n\n3.1950[Motor Mania]\n4.1950[Hold That Pose]\n\n5.1951[Lion Down]\n6.1951[Home Made Home]\n7.1951[Cold War]\n8.1951[Tomorrow We Diet]\n9.1951[Get Rich Quick]\n10.1951[Fathers Are People]\n11.1951[No Smoking]\n\n12.1952[Fathers Lion]\n13.1952[Hello Aloha]\n14.1952[Mans Best Friend]\n15.1952[Two Gun Goofy]\n16.1952[Teachers Are People]\n17.1952[Two Weeks Vacation]\n18.1952[How To Be A Detective]\n\n20.1953[Fathers Day Off]\n21.1953[For Whom The Bells Toil]\n22.1953[Fathers Week-End]\n23.1953[How To Dance]\n24.1953[How To Sleep]\n\n25.1961[Aquamania]\n\nextra-a conversation with bill farmer\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa3c5627e7324f399ed85f3fc9e0aee5d11bb2d","amp;dn":"Walt-Disney%5BTreasures%5D-The+Complete+Goofy+2+Disc+Boxset-xvids-Wi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa3c5627e7324f399ed85f3fc9e0aee5d11bb2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,163,197,98,126,115,36,243,153,237,133,243,252,158,10,238,93,17,187,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
