Neal Caffrey, een charmant crimineel meesterbrein, is eindelijk gevangen door zijn aartsvijand, FBI-agent Peter Burke. Als Neal ontsnapt uit een maximaal beveiligde gevangenis op zoek naar zijn verloren liefde, vangt Peter hem nogmaals. In plaats van terug te keren naar de gevangenis, suggereert Neal een alternatief plan: Hij zal de FBI voorzien van zijn criminele expertise om hen te helpen bij het vangen van andere ongrijpbare criminelen. Aanvankelijk op zijn hoede, komt Peter er al snel achter dat NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inzicht en intuÃƒÂ¯tie niet kan worden gevonden aan de goede kant van de wet.\n\nVertaling: Sliepie\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 01: Borrowed Time\n\nPeter brings Rebecca in to help locate Neal, who is being held captive by one of her former associates. Jim has lofty aspirations of joining an exclusive group of thieves, and his entry ticket is the diamond currently held by the FBI.\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 02: Return to Sender\n\nPeter presents NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deal to his superiors at the FBI: Neal will bring down the Pink Panthers in exchange for his freedom. And this time Neal is making sure there are wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be any technicalities. The stakes couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be higher for Peter either, as Pillar makes it clear that the bureau is intent on bring down the Panthers and Peter could lose his job if NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan goes south. When Neal finds out that Keller is now part of the Panthers, Peter wants to call off the mission and simply take Keller down once and for all, but Neal knows that this is his last chance. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust Keller and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure out why he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sell him out to the Panthers right away, unless Keller needs something from him...\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 03: Uncontrolled Variables\n\nNeal is conflicted over scamming an innocent mark; Peter works with an audacious Interpol agent who could jeopardize their operation.\n\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 04: All's Fair\n\nNeal hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard from the Panthers in days and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worried that either Keller turned on him or Woodford simply decided to cut him out of the deal. Using the algorithm Neal stole for the Panthers, the team is able to determine that the Panthers are targeting something arriving at the San Francisco airport. But without enough time to make it to the West Coast, Peter is forced to pass on the task to the local FBI office. Meanwhile, Mozzie comes face to face with his wife, who he met on a con, married on a whim, and hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen in five years. She insists that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reformed and wants to start a new life (with someone new), but Mozzie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t convinced, and asks Neal and Peter for help.\n\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 05: Whack-a-Mole\n\nThe FBI knows that the Panthers are going after the Federal Reserve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ specifically, a shipment of international funds that can contain up to $500 million. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trouble afoot, as Woodford has discovered that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mole in the operation. Surprisingly, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t suspect Neal, but rather tasks him with revealing their identity. Peter needs to convince Luc to pull Keller or risk the Panthers going underground again. And when the Panthers decide to use firepower on the Federal Reserve job, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Neal to convince them he has a better plan.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 6 Aflevering 06: Au Revoir\n\nSeriesfinale\n\nNeal and Mozzie prepare to put their plan into motion. With Peter undercover in the Panthers now as well, the stakes couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be higher. Neal and Mozzie know that Keller will try and double cross them, but they have no choice but to work with him and have planned for every contingency. If the plan works, the Panthers will be taken down, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have $30 million of the Federal Reserve heist and Neal will have his freedom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether the FBI is ready or not.\n\n\nDeze serie wordt u aangeboden door het DutchReleaseTeam.\nVoor de reviews van de nieuwste films, muziek, series, games etc\nKom eens langs op &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hetmultimediacafe.nl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hetmultimediacafe.nl/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDutchReleaseTeam = Hardcoded Dutch Subs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37bed025d28637217d1fe60af6b45ef3d563be86","amp;dn":"White+Collar+S06+HDTV+NL+Subs+DutchReleaseTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37bed025d28637217d1fe60af6b45ef3d563be86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,190,208,37,210,134,55,33,125,31,230,10,246,180,94,243,213,99,190,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
