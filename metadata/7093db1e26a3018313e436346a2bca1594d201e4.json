Typical in-game objectives are expected to be similar to those issued in real life such as raiding terrorist hideouts, hostage rescues and undercover operations. The game is loosely based on parts of Operation Anaconda; specifically, the events surrounding the Battle of Roberts Ridge.\n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nThe single player campaign takes place in 2002 ,Afghanistan. For half of the game, players assume the role of a DEVGRU operator codenamed \\&quot;Rabbit\\&quot;, of AFO Neptune. For the remainder, the player alternates between the roles of a Delta Force sniper code-named \\&quot;Deuce\\&quot;, of AFO Wolfpack, as well as Army Ranger Specialist Dante Adams of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and AH-64 Apache gunner Captain Brad \\&quot;Hawk\\&quot; Hawkins.\n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nI am not a porting professional nor a Mac techie, so please do not give me complaints on lag, etc. \n\n\n\n[OS:10.6+]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7093db1e26a3018313e436346a2bca1594d201e4","amp;dn":"Medal+of+Honor+2010+.%3A%5BMAC%5D%3A.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7093db1e26a3018313e436346a2bca1594d201e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,147,219,30,38,163,1,131,19,228,54,52,106,43,202,21,148,210,1,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
