Baker doesn&amp;#039;t sing here, but his highly emotive and lyrical trumpet playing makes this album more than compelling. Most importantly, this is one of the few recording sessions where he was accompanied by the legendary pianist, Bill Evans. Evans and Baker&amp;#039;s approaches to jazz were uniquely individual, yet they both imbued their musical vocabulary with a high degree of pathos; they also shared a great love for soft, delicate ballads.\n\nOn &quot;Alone Together&quot; and &quot;If You Could See Me Now,&quot; Evans plays a subtle yet penetrating piano introduction, and Baker enters with his distinctly rich and breathy tone. Truly a great musical pair, Baker and Evans lead an all-star band in what can only be characterized as relaxed but reflective jazz. A merging of East and West Coast cool jazz styles, CHET is an album that emphasizes instrumental restraint, yet deep musical tenderness\n\nPersonnel:\nPepper Adams (Sax (Baritone)\nChet Baker (Trumpet)\nBill Evans (Piano)\nPhilly Joe Jones (Drums)\nHerbie Mann (Flute)\nKenny Burrell (Guitar)\nPaul Chambers (Bass)\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Alone Together (Howard Dietz, Arthur Schwartz) (6:52)\n2.How High the Moon (Nancy Hamilton, Morgan Lewis) (3:36)\n3.It Never Entered My Mind (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart ) (4:41)\n4.&amp;#039;Tis Autumn (Henry Nemo) (5:18)\n5.If You Could See Me Now (Tadd Dameron, Carl Sigman)(5:17)\n6.September Song (Kurt Weill, Maxwell Anderson) (3:05)\n7.You&amp;#039;d Be So Nice to Come Home To (Cole Porter) (4:33)\n8.Time on My Hands (You in My Arms) (Vincent Youmans)(4:33)\n9.You and the Night and the Music (Howard Dietz, Arthur Schwartz)(4:06)\n10.Early Morning Mood (Chet Baker) (9:02)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab77f0b05dc60eb827f02b96bae31411464f6dc5","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Chet+%281959%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab77f0b05dc60eb827f02b96bae31411464f6dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,119,240,176,93,198,14,184,39,240,43,150,186,227,20,17,70,79,109,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
