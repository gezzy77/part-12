Each restaurant featured in the film has been around for more than forty years, uses only fresh meat, and in many cases can boast the fact that ownership has stayed within the same family. \n\nNot only is each establishment family run, but their booths, counters, and stools have seen families come together and grow over the years. The tenets of tradition, family, and pride are what make Hamburger America a truly American tale.\n\nAbout the Author\nGeorge Motz is a documentary filmmaker and America's foremost hamburger expert. He has taught a course on hamburgers at NYU and has consulted for many hamburger restaurants.
