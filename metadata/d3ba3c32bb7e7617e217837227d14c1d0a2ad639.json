The Rolling Stones didn't. In several of the songs recorded for Stripped (1995), Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood play electric guitars. So all those who had some appetite for an unplugged Rolling Stones record were probably left a little unhappy. \nThat said, Stripped is a really nice live record especially for their hard-core fans. Most of the live records that the Stones have released over time, from `Get yer ya-ya's out! (1970) onward (with the possible exception of Still Life, 1982), were centered around classic Rolling Stones hits such as Honky Tonk Women, Satisfaction, Sympathy for the Devil, Jumpin' Jack Flash and, more recently, Start me up. Stripped represents a step in a different direction as most of the songs recorded live for this album are the sometimes unjustly neglected Stones B-Side. The Stones recorded one song from their 1969 album. Interestingly what they played was Let it bleed instead of Gimme Shelter or You can't always get what you want. There are three songs from Sticky Fingers (1971), but two of the them (Dead Flowers and Love in Vain) are not neraly as well known as Brown Sugar. Two of the songs that appear on Stripped were originally released in Exile on Main Street (1972). But even in this case, the Stones opted for Sweet Virginia and Shine a Light, instead of performing the superfamous Tumbling Dice or Happy. \nBut the overall quality of Stripped is great and record is nice treat not only for Stones fans. A final note is order, this is the second record with Darryl Jones on bass and it just shows how well he blended with the rest of the band not only in studio but also in live performances.\n\nby Riccardo Pelizzo\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Street Fighting Man.wma                                          \n02 - Like A Rolling Stone.wma                                         \n03 - Not Fade Away.wma                                                \n04 - Shine A Light.wma                                                \n05 - The Spider And The Fly.wma                                       \n06 - I'm Free.wma                                                     \n07 - Wild Horses.wma                                                  \n08 - Let It Bleed.wma                                                 \n09 - Dead Flowers.wma                                                 \n10 - Slipping Away.wma                                                \n11 - Angie.wma                                                        \n12 - Love In Vain.wma                                                 \n13 - Sweet Virginia.wma                                               \n14 - Little Baby.wma    \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
