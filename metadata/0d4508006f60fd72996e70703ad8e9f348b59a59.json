I am sorry about that and I hope this will alleviate any confusion.\n\n\nv0.11\nAdded the possibility to automatically close any open Quickbooks or Intuit programs that may interfere with the backing up, replacing and restoring of the patched file, provided a certain Windows program exists.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4508006f60fd72996e70703ad8e9f348b59a59","amp;dn":"Quickbooks+2013+Activator+v0.12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4508006f60fd72996e70703ad8e9f348b59a59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,69,8,0,111,96,253,114,153,110,112,112,58,216,233,243,72,181,154,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
