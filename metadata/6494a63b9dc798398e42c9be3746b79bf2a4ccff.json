Until now, much of the research into the rich and varied history of mathematics education has remained inaccessible to the vast majority of scholars, not least because it has been written in the language, and for readers, of an individual country. And yet a historical overview, however brief, has become an indispensable element of nearly every dissertation and scholarly article. This handbook provides, for the first time, a comprehensive and systematic aid for researchers around the world in finding the information they need about historical developments in mathematics education, not only in their own countries, but globally as well.\nAlthough written primarily for mathematics educators, this handbook will also be of interest to researchers of the history of education in general, as well as specialists in cultural and even social history.\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nThis is the first comprehensive International Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education, covering a wide spectrum of epochs and civilizations, countries and cultures.

He received his Ph.D. in mathematics education from Herzen Pedagogical University in St. Petersburg, Russia, and also holds a degree from the same university in history and education. Currently, his scholarly interests span several areas, including the history of mathematics education, gifted education, mathematics teacher education, and the theory of mathematical problem solving. He is the managing editor of the International Journal for the History of Mathematics Education and the author of over one hundred publications, including over twenty books.\nGert Schubring is a retired member of the Institut fÃƒÂ¼r Didaktik der Mathematik, a research institute at Bielefeld University, and at present is visiting professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). His research interests focus on the history of mathematics and the sciences in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and their systemic interrelation with social-cultural systems. One of his specializations is history of mathematics education. He has published several books, among which is Conflicts between Generalization, Rigor and Intuition: Number Concepts Underlying the Development of Analysis in 17thÃ¢â‚¬â€œ19th Century France and Germany (New York, 2005). He is Chief-Editor of the International Journal for the History of Mathematics Education.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6494a63b9dc798398e42c9be3746b79bf2a4ccff","amp;dn":"Gert+Schubring+-+Handbook+on+the+History+of+Mathematics+Educatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6494a63b9dc798398e42c9be3746b79bf2a4ccff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,148,166,59,157,199,152,57,142,66,201,190,55,70,183,155,242,164,204,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
